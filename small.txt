101001Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness: Nightmare Moon.
101000[lightning crack]
101001She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom: the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both...
101002...sun and moon...
101003...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?
101000[theme song]
101004There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?
101003Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
101004[sigh] Does that pony do anything except study? I think she's more interested in books than friends.
101003I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
101005Ow!
101003Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
101005[groan]
101003There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?
101005Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
101000[squeak]
101003Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
101005But we're on a break!
101003No, no, no... no, no, no! [grunts] Spike!
101005It's over here!
101000[whack]
101003Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see: Mare in the Moon?
101005Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.
101003Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal! [gasp] Spike! Do you know what this means?
101005No— whoa!
101000[smack]
101005Ow!
101003Take a note please, to the princess.
101005Okie dokie.
101003My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!
101005Hold on. Preci... preci...
101003Threshold.
101005Threh...
101003Uh, brink? Ugh... That something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
101005Twi... light Spar... kle. Got it!
101003Great! Send it.
101005Now?
101003Of course!
101005Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow.
101003That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the princess is told right away!
101005Impera... impera...
101003Important!
101005Whoa!
101000[crunch]
101005Okay, okay! [inhale] There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath...
101003Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.
101005[belch]
101003See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
101005[clears throat] My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely.
101003Mm-hm!
101005...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!
101003[gasp]
101005My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location: Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete: make some friends!
101003[groan]
101005Look on the bright side, Twilight. The princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?
101003Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.
101005Then... when will you make friends, like the princess said?
101003She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.
101006[whinnying]
101003Thank you, sirs.
101006[huffing]
101005Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!
101003Uh... hello?
101007[prolonged gasp]
101003Well, that was interesting all right.
101005[sigh]
101005Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations: Sweet Apple Acres.
101008Yeehaw!
101000[thump]
101003[sigh] Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle—
101008Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!
101003Friends? Actually, I—
101008So, what can I do you for?
101005[snickering]
101003[clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?
101008We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
101003As long as it doesn't take too long...
101000[triangle ringing]
101008Soup's on, everypony!
101000[thump]
101008Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?
101003Thanks, but I really need to hurry—
101008This here's Apple Fritter, Apple Bumpkin, Red Gala, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.
101009[snort] Wha...? Soup's on? I'm up, here I come, ahm comin'...
101008Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!
101003[spit] [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way.
10100aAren't you gonna stay for brunch?
101003Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do.
10100bAwww...
101003...Fine.
10100b[cheering]
101005Food's all taken care of, next is weather.
101003Ugh... I ate too much pie...
101005Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
101003Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?
101000[crash]
101003Nng...
10100c[chuckles sheepishly] Uh, 'scuse me? [chuckles]
101003[grumbles]
10100cLemme help you.
101000[rushing water]
10100c[laughs] Oops, I guess I overdid it. Um, uh, how about this? My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry! No no, don't thank me. You're quite welcome. [laughing]
101005[laughing]
101003Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
10100cThe one and only. Why, you heard of me?
101003I heard you're supposed to be keeping the sky clear. [sigh] I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the princess sent me to check on the weather.
10100cYeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
101003Practicing for what?
10100cThe Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
101003The Wonderbolts?
10100cYep!
101003The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
10100cThat's them!
101003Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
10100cHey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
101003Prove it.
101000[whooshing noises]
10100c[sounds of exertion] Loop-de-loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging.
101000[sheep baaing]
10100c[chuckles] You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more.
101005Wow, she's amazing! [laughs]
101003Rrgh.
101005Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!
101005Decorations. Beautiful...
101003Yes, the décor is coming along nicely. This ought'a be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed.
101005Not the décor, her!
10100dNo, no, no, oh! Goodness no.
101005How are my spines? Are they straight?
101003Good afternoon—
10100dJust a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo— [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!
101003Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!
10100dOut of my hair? What about your hair?
101003Wait! Where are we going? Help!
10100dNo, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.
101003[wincing] I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to—
10100dHuh?
101000[crash]
10100dCanterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!
101003Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
101005[sigh]
101005Wasn't she wonderful?
101003Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?
101005[clears throat] Oh, uh, music! It's the last one!
101000[distant birdsong fanfare]
10100eOh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-
101003Hello!
10100e[yelp]
101003Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music, and it's sounding beautiful. [pause] I'm Twilight Sparkle. What's your name?
10100e[very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.
101003I'm sorry, what was that?
10100e[even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.
101003Didn't quite catch that.
10100e[squeaking]
101003...Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!
10100e[squeaking]
101003Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy.
10100e[gasp] A baby dragon!
101000[thump]
10100eOh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!
101005Well, well, well...!
10100eOh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!
101003Well, in that case, we'd better be going.
10100eWait, wait! What's his name?
101005I'm Spike.
10100eHi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?
101005Well, what do you wanna know?
10100eAbsolutely everything.
101003[groan]
101005Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...
101005...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?
10100eOh, yes, please!
101005Gyah!
101003I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
101005No I don't— whoa!
101003Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!
10100ePoor thing, you simply must get into bed...
101003Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!
101000[door slamming]
101005Huh. Rude much?
101003Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?
101000[honk]
10100fSurprise!
101000[kazoo blows]
101003[groan]
101007Surprise!
101000[party whistle blows]
101007Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?
101003Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
101007Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all "hello" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!
101003[groan]
101007And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I should throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!
101008Are you all right, sugarcube?
101000[train whistle]
101007Aww, she's so happy she's crying!
101005"Hot sauce".
101007Ooh... [with mouth full] What? It's good!
101000[muffled disco music]
101000[clock ticking]
101003[groan]
101000[door opens]
101005Hey Twilight! Pinkie Pie's starting "pin the tail on the pony"! Wanna play?
101003No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
101005It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!
101003[mockingly imitates Spike]
101000[door closes]
101003Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn more about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." I hope the princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale...
101000[door opens]
101005C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!
101007Isn't this exciting? Are you excited 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited— well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?
101000[fanfare]
101010Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!
101000[ponies cheering]
101010In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria...
10100eReady?
101010...Princess Celestia!
10100dHuh?
101000[ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]
101003This can't be good.
101010Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!
101007Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?
10100dShe's gone!
101000[ponies gasping]
101007Ooh, she's good. [yelp]
101000[ponies gasping]
101003Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
101005[sigh]
101011Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious little sun-loving faces.
10100cWhat did you do with our princess?!
101008[muffled] Whoa there, Nelly!
101011[chuckle] Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am?
101007Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie! No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty—[muffled noises]
101011Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?
101003I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon – Nightmare Moon!
101000[ponies gasping]
101011Well, well, well. Somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here.
101003You're here to... to... [gulp]
101011[chuckle] Remember this day, little ponies, for it was your last. From this moment forth, the night will last forever! [laughter, thunder]
101000[To be continued...]
101000[music]
101000[credits]
102000[Previously on My Little Pony]
102003"Elements of Harmony, see 'Mare in the Moon'"?
102005But that's just an old ponies' tale.
102003She will bring about nighttime eternal.
102003It's imperative that the princess is told right away.
102005[burps]
102003I knew she would wanna take immediate action.
102005My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends!
102007[prolonged gasp]
102003All the ponies in this town are crazy!
102003I hope the Princess was right.
10200dShe's gone!
102003Oh no. Nightmare Moon!
102011[evil laugh]
102000[theme song]
102011[evil laugh]
102010Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is!
102011Stand back, you foals! [laughs]
102000[screaming]
102008Ergh...
10200cCome back here! [pants] Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going?
102005Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!... [snoring]
102003You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?
10200cAnd just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!
102008Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?
102003I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do!
102007"The Elements of Harmony: A Reference Guide."
102003How did you find that?!
102007[sing-song voice] It was under "E"!
102003Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known: Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now...
102012The Everfree Forest!
102007Whee! Let's go!
102003Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own.
102008No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple.
102013Mm hm.
102007Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.
102003[sigh]
102003So, none of you have been in here before?
10200dUgh, heavens no! Just look at it—it's dreadful.
102008And it ain't natural. Folks say it don't work the same as Equestria.
102003What's that supposed to mean?
10200cNopony knows. You know why?
102008Rainbow, quit it.
10200c'Cause everypony who's ever come in has never... come... out!
102000[crash]
102000[screams]
10200cFluttershy! Quick!
10200eOh my goodness, oh my goodness.
10200d[screams]
102003[screams]
102008Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
102003Applejack! What do I do?
102008Let go.
102003Are you crazy?
102008No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
102003That's not true!
102008Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
102003Yaaah! Phew-wah!
10200eSorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
102000[animal roar]
10200cAnd once Pinkie and Rarity were safe, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.
102003Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta— [gasp] A manticore!
102014[roar]
102003We've gotta get past him!
10200dTake that, you ruffian!
102014[roar]
10200dMy hair! [yell]
10200eWait.
102014[roar]
102008YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie.
10200eWait.
102014[roars]
102008Whoa! All yours, partner.
10200cI'm on it.
10200eWait!
102014[roars]
10200c[screams]
102003Rainbow!
102014[grunt]
102003[snorts]
10200eWAIT!
102014[roar]
10200eShhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
10200cLittle?
10200eNow this might hurt for just a second.
102014[roar]
102015Fluttershy!
102014[purrs]
10200e[giggles] Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are.
102003How did you know about the thorn?
10200eI didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
10200dNo. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally.
102003That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
10200dI didn't see you there, my apologies.
10200cRight here... guh...
102008Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'.
10200e[scream]
102008It's just mud.
102000[tree growls]
102008Aah!
102000[trees growling]
102000[screams]
102000[screams]
102007[laughter]
102012Huh?
102007[laughter] Bleh. Ooo! [funny noises] [laughter]
102003Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!
102007Oh girls, don't you see?
102000[Pinkie Pie]
102000When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...
102003Tell me she's not...
102000[Pinkie Pie]
102000The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown...
10200dShe is.
102000[Pinkie Pie]
102000I'd hide under my pillow
102000From what I thought I saw
102000But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
102000To deal with fears at all
10200cThen what is?
102000[Pinkie Pie]
102000She said, "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
102000Learn to face your fears
102000You'll see that they can't hurt you
102000Just laugh to make them disappear."
102000Ha! Ha! Ha!
10200f[gasp]
102000[Pinkie Pie]
102000So, giggle at the ghostly
102000Guffaw at the grossly
102000Crack up at the creepy
102000Whoop it up with the weepy
102000Chortle at the kooky
102000Snortle at the spooky
102000And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh...
102000Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuugh!
102000[laughs]
102007How are we gonna cross this?
102000[distant cry]
102007Huh?
102016[sobbing] What a world, what a world!
102003Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
102016Well, I don't know. I was just sitting here, minding my own business, when this tacky little cloud of purple smoke just whisked past me and tore half of my beloved mustache clean off, and now I look simply horrid. [wails]
10200cOh, give me a break.
102008That's what all the fuss is about?
10200dWhy, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.
102016[sniffs] I know.
10200dAnd your expertly coiffed mane.
102016Oh, I know, I know.
10200dYour fabulous manicure.
102016[gasp] It's so true!
10200dAll ruined without your beautiful mustache.
102016It's true, I'm hideous!
10200dI simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
102016[yelp] What did you do that for?
102003Rarity, what are you—
102016[moans] Oh-hohohoho! My mustache. How wonderful.
10200dYou look smashing.
102003Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail...
10200dOh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.
10200cSo would the mustache.
102003[gasp] We can cross now. Let's go. Ah!
102016Allow me.
102003There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it!
102008Twilight, wait for us!
102003We're almost there. Whoa!
10200cWhat's with you and falling off cliffs today?
102007[sighs] Now what?
10200cDuh.
102007Oh yeah.
102017Rainbow...
10200cWho's there?
102017Rainbow...
10200cI ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
102017We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the best flyer in Equestria.
10200cWho?
102017Why, you, of course.
10200cReally?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'Cause I've been trying to get into that group for, like, ever.
102017No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us, the Shadowbolts. We're the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent...
10200cYep.
102017Swiftest...
10200cYes.
102017Bravest flyer in all the land.
10200cYes, [chuckle] it's all true.
102017We need... you.
10200cWOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
102017No! It's them or us.
102003Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them.
102017Well?
10200cYou... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
102000[ponies cheering]
10200cSee? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
102003Whoa.
102008Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
102003The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!
102007One, two, three, four... There's only five!
10200cWhere's the sixth?
102003The book said: when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed.
102008What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
102003I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen.
102008Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.
102003Aah!
102012Twilight!
102003The Elements!
102018["Where did she go?" "What's going on?"]
102008Twilight, where are you?
10200dLook!
102008Come on!
102003[coughs, gasps]
102011[evil laugh]
102003[gasp] Hmph!
102011You're kidding. You're kidding, right?
102003[groan] Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!
102011No, no!
102003[gasp] But... where's the sixth Element?!
102011[laughter] You little foal! Thinking you could defeat me? Now you will never see your princess, or your sun! The night will last forever! [evil laugh]
102018["Twilight?" "Don't worry, we'll be there." "We're here."]
102003[gasp] You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here.
102011What?
102003Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty! Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness! Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter! Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity! And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty! The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
102011You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!
102003But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all... are my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element: the element of... magic!
102011Nooo! Nooo!
10200cUgh, my head.
102008Everypony okay?
10200dOh, thank goodness.
10200eWhy Rarity, it's so lovely.
10200dI know! I'll never part with it again.
10200eNo. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
10200dWhat? Ooh. So does yours.
10200e[gasp]
102007Look at mine! Look at mine!
10200cAw yeah.
102008Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.
102019Indeed you do.
102003[gasps] Princess Celestia.
102019Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it.
102003But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
102019I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!
10201a[gasp]
102019It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister.
10201bSister?
102019Will you accept my friendship?
102007Whoa!
10201aI'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!
102019I've missed you, too.
102007[blows her nose] [sobs] Hey, you know what this calls for?
102007A party!
102000[music and cheering ponies]
102019Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?
102003That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
102019Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.
102000[ponies cheer]
102003Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before.
102000[ponies cheer]
102007Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went [deep gasp] but I mean really—
