101001 Once upon a time, in the magical land of Equestria, there were two regal sisters who ruled together and created harmony for all the land. To do this, the eldest used her unicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. Thus, the two sisters maintained balance for their kingdom and their subjects, all the different types of ponies. But as time went on, the younger sister became resentful. The ponies relished and played in the day her elder sister brought forth but shunned and slept through her beautiful night. One fateful day, the younger unicorn refused to lower the moon to make way for the dawn. The elder sister tried to reason with her, but the bitterness in the young one's heart had transformed her into a wicked mare of darkness - Nightmare Moon.
101000 [lightning crack]
101001 She vowed that she would shroud the land in eternal night. Reluctantly, the elder sister harnessed the most powerful magic known to ponydom - the Elements of Harmony. Using the magic of the Elements of Harmony, she defeated her younger sister, and banished her permanently in the moon. The elder sister took on responsibility for both...
101002 ...sun and moon...
101003 ...and harmony has been maintained in Equestria for generations since. Hmm... Elements of Harmony. I know I've heard of those before... but where?
101000 [theme song]
101004 There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?
101003 Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
101004 [sigh] Does that pony do anything except study? I think she's more interested in books than friends.
101003 I know I've heard of the Elements of Harmony.
101005 Ow!
101003 Spike! Spi-ike! Spike?
101005 [groan]
101003 There you are. Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?
101005 Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
101000 [squeak]
101003 Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
101005 But we're on a break!
101003 No, no, no... no, no, no! [grunts] Spike!
101005 It's over here!
101000 [whack]
101003 Ah! Elements, Elements, E, E, E... Aha! Elements of Harmony, see - Mare in the Moon?
101005 Mare in the Moon? But that's just an old ponies' tale.
101003 Mare, mare... aha! The Mare in the Moon, myth from olden pony times. A powerful pony who wanted to rule Equestria, defeated by the Elements of Harmony and imprisoned in the moon. Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about nighttime eternal! [gasp] Spike! Do you know what this means?
101005 No— whoa!
101000 [smack]
101005 Ow!
101003 Take a note please, to the princess.
101005 Okie dokie.
101003 My dearest teacher, my continuing studies of pony magic have led me to discover that we are on the precipice of disaster!
101005 Hold on. Preci... preci...
101003 Threshold.
101005 Threh...
101003 Uh, brink? Ugh... That something really bad is about to happen! For you see, the mythical Mare in the Moon is in fact Nightmare Moon, and she's about to return to Equestria, and bring with her eternal night! Something must be done to make sure this terrible prophecy does not come true. I await your quick response. Your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
101005 Twi... light Spar... kle. Got it!
101003 Great! Send it.
101005 Now?
101003 Of course!
101005 Uh, I dunno, Twilight, Princess Celestia's a little busy getting ready for the Summer Sun Celebration. And it's like, the day after tomorrow.
101003 That's just it, Spike. The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration! It's imperative that the princess is told right away!
101005 Impera... impera...
101003 Important!
101005 Whoa!
101000 [crunch]
101005 Okay, okay! [inhale] There, it's on its way. But I wouldn't hold your breath...
101003 Oh, I'm not worried, Spike. The princess trusts me completely. In all the years she's been my mentor she's never once doubted me.
101005 [belch]
101003 See? I knew she would want to take immediate action.
101005 [clears throat] My dearest, most faithful student Twilight. You know that I value your diligence and that I trust you completely.
101003 Mm-hm!
101005 ...but you simply must stop reading those dusty old books!
101003 [gasp]
101005 My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying, so I'm sending you to supervise the preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration in this year's location - Ponyville. And, I have an even more essential task for you to complete - make some friends!
101003 [groan]
101005 Look on the bright side, Twilight. The princess arranged for you to stay in a library. Doesn't that make you happy?
101003 Yes, yes it does. You know why? Because I'm right! I'll check on the preparations as fast as I can, then get to the library to find some proof of Nightmare Moon's return.
101005 Then... when will you make friends, like the princess said?
101003 She said to check on preparations. I am her student, and I'll do my royal duty, but the fate of Equestria does not rest on me making friends.
101006 [whinnying]
101003 Thank you, sirs.
101006 [huffing]
101005 Maybe the ponies in Ponyville have interesting things to talk about. Come on, Twilight, just try!
101003 Uh... hello?
101007 [prolonged gasp]
101003 Well, that was interesting all right.
101005 [sigh]
101005 Summer Sun Celebration official overseer's checklist. Number one, banquet preparations - Sweet Apple Acres.
101008 Yeehaw!
101000 [thump]
101003 [sigh] Let's get this over with... Good afternoon. My name is Twilight Sparkle—
101008 Well, howdy-doo, Miss Twilight, a pleasure makin' your acquaintance. I'm Applejack. We here at Sweet Apple Acres sure do like makin' new friends!
101003 Friends? Actually, I—
101008 So, what can I do you for?
101005 [snickering]
101003 [clears throat] Well, I am in fact here to supervise preparations for the Summer Sun Celebration. And you're in charge of the food?
101008 We sure as sugar are! Would you care to sample some?
101003 As long as it doesn't take too long...
101000 [triangle ringing]
101008 Soup's on, everypony!
101000 [thump]
101008 Now, why don't I introduce y'all to the Apple family?
101003 Thanks, but I really need to hurry—
101008 This here's Apple Fritter, Apple Bumpkin, Red Gala, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Caramel Apple, Apple Strudel, Apple Tart, Baked Apples, Apple Brioche, Apple Cinnamon Crisp... [deep breath] Big McIntosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith. Up'n'attem, Granny Smith, we got guests.
101009 [snort] Wha...? Soup's on? I'm up, here I come, ahm comin'...
101008 Why, I'd say you're already part of the family!
101003 [spit] [nervous laughter] Okay, well, I can see the food situation is handled, so we'll be on our way.
10100a Aren't you gonna stay for brunch?
101003 Sorry, but we have an awful lot to do.
10100b Awww...
101003 ...Fine.
10100b [cheering]
101005 Food's all taken care of, next is weather.
101003 Ugh... I ate too much pie...
101005 Hmm, there's supposed to be a Pegasus pony named Rainbow Dash clearing the clouds.
101003 Well, she's not doing a very good job, is she?
101000 [crash]
101003 Nng...
10100c [chuckles sheepishly] Uh, 'scuse me? [chuckles]
101003 [grumbles]
10100c Lemme help you.
101000 [rushing water]
10100c [laughs] Oops, I guess I overdid it. Um, uh, how about this? My very own patented Rain-Blow Dry! No no, don't thank me. You're quite welcome. [laughing]
101005 [laughing]
101003 Let me guess. You're Rainbow Dash.
10100c The one and only. Why, you heard of me?
101003 I heard you're supposed to be keeping the sky clear. [sigh] I'm Twilight Sparkle, and the princess sent me to check on the weather.
10100c Yeah, yeah, that'll be a snap. I'll do it in a jiffy. Just as soon as I'm done practicing.
101003 Practicing for what?
10100c The Wonderbolts! They're gonna perform at the Celebration tomorrow, and I'm gonna show 'em my stuff!
101003 The Wonderbolts?
10100c Yep!
101003 The most talented flyers in all of Equestria?
10100c That's them!
101003 Pfft! Please. They'd never accept a Pegasus who can't even keep the sky clear for one measly day.
10100c Hey, I could clear this sky in ten seconds flat.
101003 Prove it.
101000 [whooshing noises]
10100c [sounds of exertion] Loop-de-loop around, and wham! What'd I say? Ten. Seconds. Flat. I'd never leave Ponyville hanging.
101000 [sheep baaing]
10100c [chuckles] You should see the look on your face. Ha! You're a laugh, Twilight Sparkle. I can't wait to hang out some more.
101005 Wow, she's amazing! [laughs]
101003 Rrgh.
101005 Wait! It's kinda pretty once you get used to it!
101005 Decorations. Beautiful...
101003 Yes, the décor is coming along nicely. This ought'a be quick. I'll be at the library in no time. Beautiful indeed.
101005 Not the décor, her!
10100d No, no, no, oh! Goodness no.
101005 How are my spines? Are they straight?
101003 Good afternoon—
10100d Just a moment, please! I'm 'in the zone', as it were. Oh, yes! Sparkle always does the trick, does it not? Why, Rarity, you are a talent. Now, um, how can I help yo— [yelp] Oh my stars, darling! Whatever happened to your coiffure?!
101003 Oh, you mean my mane? Well, it's a long story. I'm just here to check on the decorations, and then I'll be out of your hair!
10100d Out of my hair? What about your hair?
101003 Wait! Where are we going? Help!
10100d No, no, uh-uh. Too green. Too yellow. Too poofy. Not poofy enough. Too frilly. Too... shiny. Now go on, my dear. You were telling me where you're from.
101003 [wincing] I've... been sent... from Canterlot... to—
10100d Huh?
101000 [crash]
10100d Canterlot?! Oh, I am so envious! The glamour, the sophistication! I have always dreamed of living there! I can't wait to hear all about it! We are gonna be the best of friends, you and I... Emeralds?! What was I thinking? Let me get you some rubies!
101003 Quick! Before she decides to dye my coat a new color!
101005 [sigh]
101005 Wasn't she wonderful?
101003 Focus, Casanova. What's next on the list?
101005 [clears throat] Oh, uh, music! It's the last one!
101000 [distant birdsong fanfare]
10100e Oh my. Um, stop please, everyone, umm. Excuse me, sir? I mean no offense, but your rhythm is just a teeny-tiny bit off. Now, follow me, please. A-one, a-two, a-one two three-
101003 Hello!
10100e [yelp]
101003 Oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to frighten your birds. I'm just here to check up on the music, and it's sounding beautiful. [pause] I'm Twilight Sparkle. What's your name?
10100e [very quietly] Um... I'm Fluttershy.
101003 I'm sorry, what was that?
10100e [even quieter] Um... My name is Fluttershy.
101003 Didn't quite catch that.
10100e [squeaking]
101003 ...Well, um, it looks like your birds are back, so I guess everything's in order. Keep up the good work!
10100e [squeaking]
101003 Oookay. [to Spike] Well, that was easy.
10100e [gasp] A baby dragon!
101000 [thump]
10100e Oh, I've never seen a baby dragon before. He's sooo cute!
101005 Well, well, well...!
10100e Oh my, he talks. I didn't know dragons could talk. That's just so incredibly wonderful I, I just don't even know what to say!
101003 Well, in that case, we'd better be going.
10100e Wait, wait! What's his name?
101005 I'm Spike.
10100e Hi Spike, I'm Fluttershy. Wow, a talking dragon! And what do dragons talk about?
101005 Well, what do you wanna know?
10100e Absolutely everything.
101003 [groan]
101005 Well... I started out as a cute little purple and green egg...
101005 ...and that's the story of my whole entire life! Well, up until today. Do you wanna hear about today?
10100e Oh, yes, please!
101005 Gyah!
101003 I am so sorry, how did we get here so fast? This is where I'm staying while in Ponyville and my poor baby dragon needs his sleep.
101005 No I don't— whoa!
101003 Aww, wook at dat, he's so sweepy he can't even keep his widdle bawance!
10100e Poor thing, you simply must get into bed...
101003 Yes, yes, we'll get right on that. Well, g'night!
101000 [door slamming]
101005 Huh. Rude much?
101003 Sorry, Spike, but I have to convince the princess that Nightmare Moon is coming, and we're running out of time! I just need to be alone so I can study without a bunch of crazy ponies trying to make friends all the time. Now, where's the light?
101000 [honk]
10100f Surprise!
101000 [kazoo blows]
101003 [groan]
101007 Surprise!
101000 [party whistle blows]
101007 Hi, I'm Pinkie Pie, and I threw this party just for you! Were you surprised? Were ya? Were ya? Huh huh huh?
101003 Very surprised. Libraries are supposed to be quiet.
101007 Well, that's silly! What kind of welcome party would this be if it were quiet? I mean, duh, bo-ring! Y'see, I saw you when you first got here, remember? You were all "hello" and I was all [deep gasp], remember? Y'see I've never saw you before and if I've never saw you before that means you're new, 'cause I know everypony, and I mean everypony in Ponyville!
101003 [groan]
101007 And if you're new, that meant you haven't met anyone yet, and if you haven't met anyone yet, you must not have any friends, and if you don't have any friends then you must be lonely, and that made me so sad, then I had an idea, and that's why I went [deep gasp]! I should throw a great big ginormous super-duper spectacular welcome party and invite everyone in Ponyville! See? And now you have lots and lots of friends!
101008 Are you all right, sugarcube?
101000 [train whistle]
101007 Aww, she's so happy she's crying!
101005 "Hot sauce".
101007 Ooh... [with mouth full] What? It's good!
101000 [muffled disco music]
101000 [clock ticking]
101003 [groan]
101000 [door opens]
101005 Hey Twilight! Pinkie Pie's starting "pin the tail on the pony"! Wanna play?
101003 No! All the ponies in this town are crazy! Do you know what time it is?!
101005 It's the eve of the Summer Sun Celebration. Everypony has to stay up, or they'll miss the princess raise the sun! You really should lighten up, Twilight. It's a party!
101003 [mockingly imitates Spike]
101000 [door closes]
101003 Ugh, here I thought I'd have time to learn more about the Elements of Harmony but, silly me, all this ridiculous friend-making has kept me from it! "Legend has it that on the longest day of the thousandth year, the stars will aid in her escape, and she will bring about everlasting night." I hope the princess was right... I hope it really is just an old pony tale...
101000 [door opens]
101005 C'mon, Twilight, it's time to watch the sunrise!
101007 Isn't this exciting? Are you excited 'cause I'm excited, I've never been so excited— well, except for the time that I saw you walking into town and I went [deep gasp] but I mean really, who can top that?
101000 [fanfare]
101010 Fillies and gentlecolts, as mayor of Ponyville, it is my great pleasure to announce the beginning of the Summer Sun Celebration!
101000 [ponies cheering]
101010 In just a few moments, our town will witness the magic of the sunrise, and celebrate this, the longest day of the year! And now, it is my great honor to introduce to you the ruler of our land, the very pony who gives us the sun and the moon each and every day, the good, the wise, the bringer of harmony to all of Equestria...
10100e Ready?
101010 ...Princess Celestia!
10100d Huh?
101000 [ponies chattering quietly and nervously in the background]
101003 This can't be good.
101010 Remain calm, everypony, there must be a reasonable explanation!
101007 Ooh, ooh, I love guessing games! Is she hiding?
10100d She's gone!
101000 [ponies gasping]
101007 Ooh, she's good. [yelp]
101000 [ponies gasping]
101003 Oh no... Nightmare Moon!
101005 [sigh]
101011 Oh, my beloved subjects. It's been so long since I've seen your precious little sun-loving faces.
10100c What did you do with our princess?!
101008 [muffled] Whoa there, Nelly!
101011 [chuckle] Why, am I not royal enough for you? Don't you know who I am?
101007 Ooh, ooh, more guessing games! Um, Hokey Smokes! How about... Queen Meanie! No! Black Snooty, Black Snooty—[muffled noises]
101011 Does my crown no longer count now that I have been imprisoned for a thousand years? Did you not recall the legend? Did you not see the signs?
101003 I did. And I know who you are. You're the Mare in the Moon – Nightmare Moon!
101000 [ponies gasping]
101011 Well, well, well. Somepony who remembers me. Then you also know why I'm here.
101003 You're here to... to... [gulp]
101011 [chuckle] Remember this day, little ponies, for it was your last. From this moment forth, the night will last forever! [laughter, thunder]
101000 [To be continued...]

102000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
102003 "Elements of Harmony, see 'Mare in the Moon'"?
102005 But that's just an old ponies' tale.
102003 She will bring about nighttime eternal.
102003 It's imperative that the princess is told right away.
102005 [burps]
102003 I knew she would wanna take immediate action.
102005 My dear Twilight, there is more to a young pony's life than studying. Make some friends!
102007 [prolonged gasp]
102003 All the ponies in this town are crazy!
102003 I hope the Princess was right.
10200d She's gone!
102003 Oh no. Nightmare Moon!
102011 [evil laugh]
102000 [theme song]
102011 [evil laugh]
102010 Seize her! Only she knows where the Princess is!
102011 Stand back, you foals! [laughs]
102000 [screaming]
102008 Ergh...
10200c Come back here! [pants] Nighttime? Forever? Where's she going?
102005 Uh... We gotta stop Nightmare!... [snoring]
102003 You've been up all night, Spike. You are a baby dragon after all. Elements, elements, elements... Ugh! How can I stop Nightmare Moon without the Elements of Harmony?
10200c And just what are the Elements of Harmony? And how did you know about Nightmare Moon, huh? Are you a spy? Whoa!
102008 Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy. But she sure knows what's going on. Don't you, Twilight?
102003 I read all about the prediction of Nightmare Moon. Some mysterious objects called the Elements of Harmony are the only things that can stop her, but I don't know what they are, where to find them; I don't even know what they do!
102007 "The Elements of Harmony - A Reference Guide."
102003 How did you find that?!
102007 [sing-song voice] It was under "E"!
102003 Oh. There are six Elements of Harmony, but only five are known - Kindness, Laughter, Generosity, Honesty and Loyalty. The sixth is a complete mystery. It is said, the last known location of the five elements was in the ancient castle of the royal pony sisters. It is located in what is now...
102012 The Everfree Forest!
102007 Whee! Let's go!
102003 Not so fast. Look, I appreciate the offer, but I'd really rather do this on my own.
102008 No can do, sugarcube. We sure ain't lettin' any friend of ours go into that creepy place alone. We're stickin' to you like caramel on a candy apple.
102013 Mm hm.
102007 Especially if there's candy apples in there. What? Those things are good.
102003 [sigh]
102003 So, none of you have been in here before?
10200d Ugh, heavens no! Just look at it—it's dreadful.
102008 And it ain't natural. Folks say it don't work the same as Equestria.
102003 What's that supposed to mean?
10200c Nopony knows. You know why?
102008 Rainbow, quit it.
10200c 'Cause everypony who's ever come in has never... come... out!
102000 [crash]
102000 [screams]
10200c Fluttershy! Quick!
10200e Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.
10200d [screams]
102003 [screams]
102008 Hold on! I'm a-comin'!
102003 Applejack! What do I do?
102008 Let go.
102003 Are you crazy?
102008 No I ain't. I promise you'll be safe.
102003 That's not true!
102008 Now listen here. What I'm sayin' to you is the honest truth. Let go, and you'll be safe.
102003 Yaaah! Phew-wah!
10200e Sorry girls. I'm not used to holding anything more than a bunny or two.
102000 [animal roar]
10200c And once Pinkie and Rarity were safe, whoosh... Me and Fluttershy loop-de-loop around and WHAM! Caught you right in the nick of time.
102003 Yes, Rainbow, I was there, and I'm very grateful, but we gotta— [gasp] A manticore!
102014 [roar]
102003 We've gotta get past him!
10200d Take that, you ruffian!
102014 [roar]
10200d My hair! [yell]
10200e Wait.
102014 [roar]
102008 YEE-HAW! Git along, little dogie.
10200e Wait.
102014 [roars]
102008 Whoa! All yours, partner.
10200c I'm on it.
10200e Wait!
102014 [roars]
10200c [screams]
102003 Rainbow!
102014 [grunt]
102003 [snorts]
10200e WAIT!
102014 [roar]
10200e Shhh... It's okay. Oh, you poor, poor little baby.
10200c Little?
10200e Now this might hurt for just a second.
102014 [roar]
102015 Fluttershy!
102014 [purrs]
10200e [giggles] Aw you're just a little ol' baby kitty, aren't you? Yes you are, yes you are.
102003 How did you know about the thorn?
10200e I didn't. Sometimes we all just need to be shown a little kindness.
10200d No. My eyes need a rest from all this icky muck. Well, I didn't mean that literally.
102003 That ancient ruin could be right in front of our faces and we wouldn't even know it.
10200d I didn't see you there, my apologies.
10200c Right here... guh...
102008 Oh wait, I think I stepped in somethin'.
10200e [scream]
102008 It's just mud.
102000 [tree growls]
102008 Aah!
102000 [trees growling]
102000 [screams]
102000 [screams]
102007 [laughter]
102012 Huh?
102007 [laughter] Bleh. Ooo! [funny noises] [laughter]
102003 Pinkie, what are you doing?! Run!
102007 Oh girls, don't you see?
102007 [Pinkie Pie]
102007 When I was a little filly and the sun was going down...
102003 Tell me she's not...
102007 [Pinkie Pie]
102007 The darkness and the shadows, they would always make me frown...
10200d She is.
102007 [Pinkie Pie]
102007 I'd hide under my pillow
102007 From what I thought I saw
102007 But Granny Pie said that wasn't the way
102007 To deal with fears at all
10200c Then what is?
102007 [Pinkie Pie]
102007 She said, "Pinkie, you gotta stand up tall
102007 Learn to face your fears
102007 You'll see that they can't hurt you
102007 Just laugh to make them disappear."
102007 Ha! Ha! Ha!
10200f [gasp]
102007 [Pinkie Pie]
102007 So, giggle at the ghostly
102007 Guffaw at the grossly
102007 Crack up at the creepy
102007 Whoop it up with the weepy
102007 Chortle at the kooky
102007 Snortle at the spooky
102007 And tell that big dumb scary face to take a hike and leave you alone and if he thinks he can scare you then he's got another thing coming and the very idea of such a thing just makes you wanna... hahahaha... heh...
102007 Laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuugh!
102000 [laughs]
102007 How are we gonna cross this?
102000 [distant cry]
102007 Huh?
102016 [sobbing] What a world, what a world!
102003 Excuse me, sir. Why are you crying?
102016 Well, I don't know. I was just sitting here, minding my own business, when this tacky little cloud of purple smoke just whisked past me and tore half of my beloved mustache clean off, and now I look simply horrid. [wails]
10200c Oh, give me a break.
102008 That's what all the fuss is about?
10200d Why, of course it is. How can you be so insensitive? Oh, just look at him. Such lovely luminescent scales.
102016 [sniffs] I know.
10200d And your expertly coiffed mane.
102016 Oh, I know, I know.
10200d Your fabulous manicure.
102016 [gasp] It's so true!
10200d All ruined without your beautiful mustache.
102016 It's true, I'm hideous!
10200d I simply cannot let such a crime against fabulosity go uncorrected.
102016 [yelp] What did you do that for?
102003 Rarity, what are you—
102016 [moans] Oh-hohohoho! My mustache. How wonderful.
10200d You look smashing.
102003 Oh, Rarity, your beautiful tail...
10200d Oh. It's fine, my dear. Short tails are in this season. Besides, it'll grow back.
10200c So would the mustache.
102003 [gasp] We can cross now. Let's go. Ah!
102016 Allow me.
102003 There it is, the ruin that holds The Elements of Harmony. We made it!
102008 Twilight, wait for us!
102003 We're almost there. Whoa!
10200c What's with you and falling off cliffs today?
102007 [sighs] Now what?
10200c Duh.
102007 Oh yeah.
102017 Rainbow...
10200c Who's there?
102017 Rainbow...
10200c I ain't scared of you! Show yourself!
102017 We've been eagerly awaiting the arrival of the best flyer in Equestria.
10200c Who?
102017 Why, you, of course.
10200c Really?! I mean... Oh yeah, me. Hey, uh, you wouldn't mind telling the Wonderbolts that, would ya? 'Cause I've been trying to get into that group for, like, ever.
102017 No, Rainbow Dash. We want you to join us, the Shadowbolts. We're the greatest aerial team in the Everfree Forest, and soon we will be the greatest in all Equestria, but first, we need a captain. The most magnificent...
10200c Yep.
102017 Swiftest...
10200c Yes.
102017 Bravest flyer in all the land.
10200c Yes, [chuckle] it's all true.
102017 We need... you.
10200c WOOHOO! Sign me up. Just let me tie this bridge real quick and then we have a deal.
102017 No! It's them or us.
102003 Rainbow, what's taking so long? Oh no. Rainbow! Don't listen to them.
102017 Well?
10200c You... Thank you! For the offer, I mean, but I'm afraid I have to say no.
102000 [ponies cheering]
10200c See? I'd never leave my friends hangin'.
102003 Whoa.
102008 Come on, Twilight. Isn't this what you've been waitin' for?
102003 The Elements of Harmony, we've found them. Careful, careful!
102007 One, two, three, four... There's only five!
10200c Where's the sixth?
102003 The book said - when the five are present, a spark will cause the sixth Element to be revealed.
102008 What in the hay is that supposed to mean?
102003 I'm not sure, but I have an idea. Stand back. I don't know what will happen.
102008 Come on now, y'all. She needs to concentrate.
102003 Aah!
102012 Twilight!
102003 The Elements!
102018 ["Where did she go?" "What's going on?"]
102008 Twilight, where are you?
10200d Look!
102008 Come on!
102003 [coughs, gasps]
102011 [evil laugh]
102003 [gasp] Hmph!
102011 You're kidding. You're kidding, right?
102003 [groan] Just one spark. Come on, come on. Aah!
102011 No, no!
102003 [gasp] But... where's the sixth Element?!
102011 [laughter] You little foal! Thinking you could defeat me? Now you will never see your princess, or your sun! The night will last forever! [evil laugh]
102018 ["Twilight?" "Don't worry, we'll be there." "We're here."]
102003 [gasp] You think you can destroy The Elements of Harmony just like that? Well, you're wrong, because the spirits of The Elements of Harmony are right here.
102011 What?
102003 Applejack, who reassured me when I was in doubt, represents the spirit of... honesty! Fluttershy, who tamed the manticore with her compassion, represents the spirit of... kindness! Pinkie Pie, who banished fear by giggling in the face of danger, represents the spirit of... laughter! Rarity, who calmed a sorrowful serpent with a meaningful gift represents the spirit of... generosity! And Rainbow Dash, who could not abandon her friends for her own heart's desire represents the spirit of... loyalty! The spirits of these five ponies got us through every challenge you threw at us.
102011 You still don't have the sixth Element! The spark didn't work!
102003 But it did! A different kind of spark. I felt it the very moment I realized how happy I was to hear you, to see you, how much I cared about you. The spark ignited inside me when I realized that you all... are my friends! You see, Nightmare Moon, when those Elements are ignited by the... the spark that resides in the heart of us all, it creates the sixth element - the element of... magic!
102011 Nooo! Nooo!
10200c Ugh, my head.
102008 Everypony okay?
10200d Oh, thank goodness.
10200e Why Rarity, it's so lovely.
10200d I know! I'll never part with it again.
10200e No. Your necklace. It looks just like your cutie mark.
10200d What? Ooh. So does yours.
10200e [gasp]
102007 Look at mine! Look at mine!
10200c Aw yeah.
102008 Gee, Twilight! I thought you were just spoutin' a lot of hooey, but I reckon we really do represent the elements of friendship.
102019 Indeed you do.
102003 [gasps] Princess Celestia.
102019 Twilight Sparkle, my faithful student. I knew you could do it.
102003 But... you told me it was all an old pony tale.
102019 I told you that you needed to make some friends, nothing more. I saw the signs of Nightmare Moon's return, and I knew it was you who had the magic inside to defeat her, but you could not unleash it until you let true friendship into your heart. Now if only another will as well. Princess Luna!
10201a [gasp]
102019 It has been a thousand years since I have seen you like this. Time to put our differences behind us. We were meant to rule together, little sister.
10201b Sister?
102019 Will you accept my friendship?
102007 Whoa!
10201a I'm so sorry! I missed you so much, big sister!
102019 I've missed you, too.
102007 [blows her nose] [sobs] Hey, you know what this calls for?
102007 A party!
102000 [music and cheering ponies]
102019 Why so glum, my faithful student? Are you not happy that your quest is complete and you can return to your studies in Canterlot?
102003 That's just it. Just when I learned how wonderful it is to have friends, I have to leave them.
102019 Spike, take a note, please. I, Princess Celestia, hereby decree that the unicorn Twilight Sparkle shall take on a new mission for Equestria. She must continue to study the magic of friendship. She must report to me her findings from her new home in Ponyville.
102000 [ponies cheer]
102003 Oh thank you, Princess Celestia! I'll study harder than ever before.
102000 [ponies cheer]
102007 Isn't this exciting? Are you excited cause I'm excited I've never been so excited, well, except for the time that I went [deep gasp] but I mean really—
102000 [music]
102000 [credits]
103005 No. Nope. Nope... [continues in background]
103008 Thank you kindly, Twilight, for helping me out. I bet Big McIntosh I could get all these Golden Delicious in the barn by lunchtime. If I win, he's gonna walk down Stirrup Street in one of Granny's girdles. [chuckles]
103003 No problem at all, Applejack. I'm glad the goal is lunchtime. All this hard work is making me hungry.
103005 I know, right?
103003 Puh-lease, Spike. You've been lounging on my back all morning while we worked.
103005 Exactly. You two are taking so long, I missed snack-time.
103003 [stomach grumbles] [laughs nervously] Eh, I guess we better get some food.
103005 Nope. Worm. A-ha!
103003 [licks lips] Oh Spike, that looks delicious!
103005 [munching]
103003 Spike.
103005 What? [burp]
103003 It's a letter from Princess Celestia.
103005 [clears throat] Hear ye, hear ye. Her Grand Royal Highness, Princess Celestia of Equestria, is pleased to announce the Grand Galloping Gala to be held in the magnificent capital city of Canterlot, on the 21st day of, eh, yadda yadda yadda, cordially extends an invitation to Twilight Sparkle plus one guest.
10301c [gasp] The Grand Galloping Gala!
103000 [theme song]
10301c The Grand Galloping Gala! [cheering]
103005 [burp] Look, two tickets.
103003 Wow, great! I've never been to the gala. Have you, Spike?
103005 No, and I plan to keep it that way. I don't want any of that girly frilly frou-frou nonsense.
103003 Aw, come on Spike. A dance would be nice.
103008 Nice? It's a heap good more than just nice. I'd love to go. Land sakes...
103008 If I had an apple stand set up, ponies would be chowin' our tasty vittles 'til the cows came home. Do you have any idea how much business I could drum up for Sweet Apple Acres? Why, with all that money, we could do a heap of fixin' up 'round here. We could replace that saggy old roof, and Big McIntosh could replace that saggy old plow, and Granny Smith could replace that saggy old hip.
103008 Why, I'd give my left hind leg to go to that gala.
103003 Oh, well in that case, would you like to—
10300c Whoa! [crash] Ugh. Are we talking about the Grand Galloping Gala?
103008 Rainbow Dash. You told me you were too busy to help me harvest apples. What were you busy doing? Spyin'?
10300c No, I was busy napping, and I just happened to hear that you have an extra ticket?
103003 Yeah, but—
10300c YES! This is so awesome. The Wonderbolts perform at the Grand Galloping Gala every year. I can see it now...
10300c Everyone would be watching the sky. Their eyes riveted on the Wonderbolts, but then in would fly Rainbow Dash!
103000 [audience gasps]
10300c I would draw their attention with my Super Speed Strut.
103000 [audience cheers]
10300c Then, I would mesmerize 'em with my Fantastic Filly Flash. And for my grand finale, the Buccaneer Blaze! The ponies would go wild!
103000 [audience cheers]
10300c The Wonderbolts would insist that my signature moves be incorporated into their routine, and then welcome me as their newest member.
10300c Don't you see, Twilight? This could be my one chance to show 'em my stuff. You gotta take me! [grunt]
103008 Hold on just one pony pickin' minute here. [spit] I asked for that ticket first.
10300c So? That doesn't mean you own it.
103008 Oh, yeah? Well I challenge you to a hoof-wrestle. Winner gets the ticket.
10301d [groan]
103003 Girls, these are my tickets, I'll decide who gets it, thank you very much. Whoever has the best reason to go should get the ticket, don't you think?
103008 Drummin' up business for the farm?
10300c A chance to audition for the Wonderbolts?
103008 Money t' fix Granny's hip.
10300c Living the dream.
103003 Oh my, those were all pretty good reasons, aren't they? [stomach rumbles] [chuckles] Listen to that, I am starving. I don't know about you, but I can't make important decisions on an empty stomach, so I'll, uh, think about it over lunch and get back to you two, okay?
10301d Okay. [groan]
103005 So who are you gonna give the ticket to, Twilight?
103003 I don't know, Spike, but I really can't think straight when I'm hungry. So where should we eat?
103000 [crash]
103007 Gah! Bats! Bats on my face! Help! Wait, these aren't... tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala?!
103007 It's the most amazing incredible tremendous super-fun wonderful terrifically humongous party in all of Equestria! I've always always always wanted to go!
103007 [Pinkie Pie]
103007 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
103007 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
103007 Hip hip
103007 Hooray!
103007 It's the best place for me
103007 For Pinkie...
103007 With decorations like streamers and fairy-lights and pinwheels and piñatas and pin-cushions. With goodies like sugar cubes and sugar canes and sundaes and sun-beams and sarsaparilla. And I get to play my favorite-est of favorite fantabulous games like Pin the Tail on the Pony!
103007 [Pinkie Pie]
103007 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
103007 Oh the Grand Galloping Gala is the best place for me
103007 'Cause it's the most galarrific superly-terrific gala ever
103007 In the whole galaxy
103007 Wheee!!
103007 Oh thank you, Twilight, it's the most wonderful-est gift ever.
103003 Um, actually—
10300d [gasp] Are these what I think they are?
103003 Uh—
103007 Yes, yes, yes! Twilight's taking me to the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot.
10300d The gala? I design ensembles for the gala every year, but I've never had the opportunity to attend. Oh, the society, the culture, the glamour! It's where I truly belong, and where I'm destined to meet him.
103007 Him! ... Who?
10300d Him.
10300d I would stroll through the gala, and everyone would wonder, "Who is that mysterious mare?" They would never guess that I was just a simple pony from little old Ponyville. Why, I would cause such a sensation that I would be invited for an audience with Princess Celestia herself, and the princess would be so taken with the style and elegance that she would introduce me to him, her nephew - the most handsome, eligible unicorn stallion in Canterlot. Our eyes would meet, our hearts would melt. Our courtship would be magnificent. He would ask for my hoof in marriage, and of course I would say, "Yes!" We would have a royal wedding, befitting a princess, which is [giggles] what I would become upon marrying him, the stallion of my dreams.
10300d Twilight, I simply cannot believe you would invite Pinkie Pie so she can... party, and prevent me from meeting my true love. How could you? Hmph.
103005 Hey!
10300e [gasp] Angel, these are perfect!
103003 Uh, listen, guys, I haven't decided who to give the extra ticket to.
10301e You haven't?!
10300e Um, excuse me, Twilight. I would just like to ask, I mean, if it would be all right, if you haven't given it to someone else...
10300d You?! You want to go to the gala?!
10300e Oh, no. I mean, yes, or, actually, kind of. You see...
10300e It's not so much the Grand Galloping Gala as it is the wondrous private gated garden that surrounds the dance. The flowers are said to be the most beautiful and fragrant in all of Equestria. For the night of the gala, and that night alone, would they all be in bloom... and that's just the flora! Don't get me started on the fauna. There's loons and toucans and bitterns, oh my! Hummingbirds that can really hum, and buzzards that can really buzz. White-blue jays, and red jays, and green jays, pink jays and pink flamingos!
103003 Gee, Fluttershy, it sounds... beautiful...?
10300c Wait just a minute.
103003 Rainbow Dash! Were you following me?
10300c No. I mean, yes. I mean, maybe. Look, it doesn't matter. I couldn't risk a goody-four-shoes like you giving that ticket away to just anybody.
103008 Wait just another minute.
103003 Applejack, were you following me too?
103008 No. I was followin' this one to make sure she didn't try any funny business. Still trying to take mah ticket.
10300c Your ticket?
103007 But Twilight's taking me.
10301f [arguing]
10301f [arguing]
103003 QUIET!
103007 And then I said, "Oatmeal, are you craz—" oh.
103003 Girls, there's no use in arguing.
10300d But Twilight—
103003 Eh! This is my decision, and I'm gonna make it on my own, and I certainly can't think straight with all this noise... [stomach rumbles] not to mention hunger. Now go on, shoo.
10301f [grumbling]
103003 And don't worry, I'll figure this out... somehow.
103003 [sighs] Spike, what am I gonna do? All five of my best friends have really good reasons to go to the gala. Applejack, or Rainbow Dash? Pinkie Pie or Fluttershy, Rarity... Oh, who should go with me? [stomach rumbles]
103020 Have you made your decision?
103003 I CAN'T DECIDE!
103005 Twilight, he just wants to take your order.
103003 Oh. I would love a daffodil and daisy sandwich.
103005 Do you have any rubies? No? Okay. I'll have the hay fries, extra crispy.
103003 What do you think, Spike?
103005 I think we have to try another restaurant. I mean, I like grass just fine, but would it hurt anybody to offer some gemstones?
103003 I mean about the Gala and the ticket and who I should take.
103005 Oh. You're still on that?
103003 Spike, listen. How do I choose? And when I do choose, will the other four be mad at me? I mean, I could give up my ticket and give away two, but that would still leave three disappointed ponies. What if I—
103020 Ah, your food.
103003 Oh thank you. This looks so good. I'm sure everything will be much clearer once I eat.
103000 [ponies galloping]
103020 Em, madam? Are you going to eat your food in ze rain?
103003 It's not raining...
103000 [thunderclap]
103003 What's going on?
10300c Hi there, best friend forever I've ever ever had. Enjoying the sunny weather?
103003 Rainbow Dash, what are you doing?
10300c Whaddya mean? I just saw the smartest, most generous pony about to get rained on, so I thought I'd kick a hole in the clouds to keep her dry so she could dine in peace, that's all.
103003 Rainbow, you're not trying to get extra consideration for the extra ticket by doing me extra special favors, are you?
10300c Me? No no no, of course not.
103003 Uh-huh.
10300c Seriously, I'd do it for anypony. [gulp] Heh heh, eh.
103003 Rainbow, I am not comfortable accepting unwanted favors, so I'd appreciate it if you close up that rain cloud right now.
10300c Ugh, fine. [zip]
103003 That's better. [groans]
10300d Twilight, it's raining.
103003 No, really?
10300d Come with me before you catch a cold!
103003 [shaking] Heh heh, oops, sorry.
10300d Oh no, it's quite all right. After all, we are... the best of friends, are we not? And you know what the best of friends do?
103003 Uh...
10300d Makeovers!
103000 [crashing, construction noises]
103003 Ugh, Rarity, ow, this really isn't fixing it. I mean, thank you but, ooh, that's too tight.
10300d There. Oh, you're simply darling.
103003 Uh, yeah, it is kinda pretty, isn't it?
10300d And you. Oh Spike, I have a dandy little outfit for the dashing gent.
103000 [more crashing, construction noises]
103005 D-ah, ow, oh, hey, wow, watch it, whoa!
103003 [giggles] Oh, Spike.
10300d Now you just need a hat.
103005 Ugh, I told you, I don't want any part of this girly gala gunk. See you back at the library.
10300d [laughs] Oh, who needs him anyway. This is all about you, and how fabulous you'll look at the Grand Galloping Gala.
103003 Wait, the Grand—
10300d [gasp] And oh, my goodness, what a coincidence. I happen to have an ensemble of my own that matches yours to a T. We would be the belles of the ball, you and I. Everyone would be clamoring for our attention. All eyes would be on us, and then everyone would finally know, the most beautiful, most talented, most sophisticated pony in all of Equestria is Rarity the unicorn! Ah... [nervous laughter] and Twilight Sparkle, of course.
103003 I see what's going on. You're just buttering me up so I give you the extra ticket. Well it's not gonna work. You're going to have to wait for my decision just like everyone else. Now if you'll excuse me, I've been trying all day just to get some lunch!
103008 Did somepony say lunch?
103003 You've got to be kidding me!
103008 I got apple pie, apple fritters, apple tarts, apple dumplings, apple crisps, apple crumblers, and apple Brown Betty. Uh, the dessert, not my auntie. What do you say there, best friend?
103003 [stomach grumbles]
103008 Is that a yes?
103003 No. No! I don't know who I'm giving the ticket to, and all these favors aren't making it any easier to decide. In fact, I'm less sure now than I was this morning. Ugh!
103008 So, that's a maybe?
103003 Ugh, I never thought being showered with favors would be so aggravating.
10300e [humming]
103003 [gasp] Fluttershy, not you too!
10300e Oh, well, hello, Twilight. I hope you don't mind, but we're all doing a little spring cleaning for you.
103003 It's summer.
10300e Oh, well, better late than never, right? It was Angel's idea.
103003 You're not doing this for the ticket, are you?
10300e Oh, no, I'm doing this because you're my very best friend. Right, Angel? Oh, yes, we are just doing this for the ticket.
103003 No, no, no! Well, this was all very nice of you and Angel, but I'm not accepting any extra favors until I've made my final decision, so I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
10300f SURPRISE!
103000 [trumpets blow]
103007 [Pinkie Pie]
103007 Twilight is my bestest friend, whoopie, whoopie!
103003 Pinkie...
103007 [Pinkie Pie]
103007 She's the cutest, smartest, all around best pony, pony!
103003 Pinkie.
103007 [Pinkie Pie]
103007 I bet if I throw a super-duper fun party, party!
103003 Pinkie!
103007 [Pinkie Pie]
103007 She'll give her extra ticket to the Gala to me!
103003 PIIINKIIIE!
103007 Yes, Twilight?
103003 At least the other ponies tried to be subtle about the ticket.
103021 Wait, what ticket? What gala?
103007 Oh, you didn't know? Twilight has an extra ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala!
10300f [in unison] The Grand Galloping Gala?!
103000 [offscreen: Have I ever told you how much I love your mane?]
103000 [offscreen: I'll wash your dishes.]
103022 Would you like any help with your gardening?
103023 I have a cartload of extra carrots.
103000 [offscreen: I'll paint your cottage.]
103000 [ponies offering favors]
103005 What are we gonna do?
103003 We're... gonna... run!
103000 [Benny Hill-esque music]
103000 [ponies offering favors]
103000 [offscreen: I'll do your taxes!]
103000 [offscreen: Where is she? Where did she go? She's disappeared.]
103005 Ugh... Warn me next time you're gonna do that.
103003 I didn't even know it was gonna happen. Now quick, lock the doors!
103000 [doors closing, lights clicking]
103003 Phew. Yaaaargh! I can't decide, I just can't decide! It's important to all of you and I just can't stand to disappoint any of you, and giving me gifts and doing me favors won't make any difference, because you're all my friends and I wanna make you all happy and I can't, I just can't!
103008 Twilight, sugar, I didn't mean to put so much pressure on you, and if it helps, I don't want the ticket anymore. You can give it to somepony else. I won't feel bad, I promise.
10300e Me too. I feel just awful that I made you feel so awful.
103007 And me too. It's no fun upsetting your friends.
10300d Twilight, it was unfair of me to try to force you as I did.
10300c Yes! That means the ticket is mine. Ha ha, [sing-song voice] I got the ticket, I got the ticket—! You know, I haven't perfected my signature moves for the Wonderbolts anyway. I don't need that ticket either.
103008 We all got so gung-ho about going to the gala that we couldn't see how un-gung-ho we were making you.
103024 [in unison] We're sorry, Twilight.
103003 Spike, take down a note. Dear Princess Celestia,
103003 I've learned that one of the joys of friendship is sharing your blessings, but when there's not enough blessings to go around, having more than your friends can make you feel pretty awful. So, though I appreciate the invitation, I will be returning both tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala.
103025 [in unison] What?!
103003 If my friends can't all go, I don't wanna go either.
103008 Twilight, you don't have to do that.
103003 Nope. I've made up my mind. Spike, you can send the letter now.
103005 [gasp]
10300e Now you won't get to go to the gala either.
103003 It's okay, girls. I couldn't possibly enjoy myself without my best friends there with me...
103025 [laughing, "awww"]
103003 ...So I would rather not go at all.
103005 Hgh... hgh... urk... urk...
103008 Well, wallop my withers, Spike. Isn't that just like a boy? Can't handle the least bit of sentiment.
103005 [burp]
103008 Whoa Nelly!
103003 A letter from the princess? That was fast.
103005 "My faithful student Twilight,
103005 Why didn't you just say so in the first place?" Six tickets to the Grand Galloping Gala!
103012 [gasp]
103003 Now we can all go!
103025 [cheer]
103003 [stomach rumbles] [laughs nervously]
10300d Allow us to treat you to dinner.
10300c What a great way to apologize.
103007 And to celebrate! Come on everyone, the cupcakes are on me!
103005 How come I don't get a ticket to the gala? Hurk! [burp] "And one for you, Spike." [giggles] I mean, gross. I have to go too? [continues giggling]
103008 [chuckles]
103000 [music]
103000 [credits]
104008 Boy howdy! I got my work cut out for me. That there is the biggest bumper crop o' apples I ever laid eyes on.
104026 Eeyup. Too big for you to handle on your own.
104008 Come on, big brother! You need to rest up and get yourself better. I haven't met an apple orchard yet that I can't handle. Oops, sorry. I'll take a bite out of this job by day's end.
104026 Biting off more than you can chew is just what I'm afraid of.
104008 Are you sayin' my mouth is makin' promises my legs can't keep?
104026 Eeyup.
104008 Why of all the... This is your sister Applejack, remember? The loyalest of friends and the most dependable of ponies?
104026 But still only one pony, and one pony plus hundreds o' apple trees just doesn't add up to—
104008 Don't you use your fancy mathematics to muddy the issue! I said I could handle this harvest and I'm gonna prove it to you! I'm gonna get every last apple out of those trees this applebuck season all by myself! [gulps]
104000 [theme song]
104008 Well, I better get kickin'. These apples aren't gonna shake themselves outta the trees. Hey! Oh no.
10400c STAMPEDE!
104000 [cows mooing]
104000 [ponies panicking]
104027 Stampede!
104000 [ponies panicking]
104007 [laughter] Hey...! [vibrating] This makes my voice sound silly!
104003 Pinkie Pie, are you crazy?! Run!
104010 Everypony calm down. There is no need to panic.
10400d But Mayor, whatever shall we do?
10400c Look there!
104008 YEEHAW!
104000 [ponies cheer]
104008 Other side, Winona! Put 'em up, girl!
104028 [barking]
10400d [moan]
104007 This is the best rodeo show I've ever seen! [chewing]
104008 Come on, little dogies! Turn! [whistle] Winona, put 'em up! Ha-ha! Gotcha! [grunt]
104028 [bark]
104008 Attagirl. [grunts] Yee haw!
104000 [ponies cheer]
104008 Whoaaa. Hooie. Now what was that all about?
104029 [moo] [cough] Oh my! Begging your pardon, Applejack, but Moo-riella here saw one of those nasty snakes.
104000 [cows startled]
104029 And it just gave us all the willies, don'tcha know.
104008 I completely understand. Just next time, try and steer clear of Ponyville.
104029 We certainly will, Applejack. So long, Winona!
104000 [ponies cheer]
104008 Yee haw!
104007 Yee haw! Ride 'em, cowpony!
104010 Applejack was just... just...
104007 Appletastic!
104010 Exactly. We must do something to thank Applejack for single-hoofedly saving the town.
104007 I know...
104007 A party!
104003 We all ready?
10400d Just one last thing. Now we're ready.
104003 Is Applejack all set?
10400c Actually, I haven't seen her all week.
104007 Not since the stampede.
10400c But she'll be here for sure. Applejack is never late.
104003 Welcome, everypony! Today we are here to honor a pony we can always count on to help in matters great and small. A pony whose contributions to—
10400c Did you see Applejack's slick moves out there? What an athlete! This week she's gonna help me with my new flying trick, and I know it's gonna be so awesome.
104003 Exactly. And—
104007 This week, I get to run Sugarcube Corner for the first time.
104003 What does that have to do with Applejack?
104007 Oh. Applejack, one of the best bakers ever, is gonna help me. Applejack makes everything great, so free samples for everypony!
104000 [ponies cheering]
104003 Oh-kay, that's great. Now if I could just make a point without being inter—
10400e Twilight?
104003 ...rupted.
10400e Twilight, I'm so sorry, but I just wanted to mention that Applejack is also helping me this week with the official bunny census, where we count up all the new baby bunnies that were born this season. She's gonna help gather them using her wonderful herding skills.
104003 Anyone else? Anyone? No? Well then, as I was trying to say... Urgh! Never mind!
104010 Ah-ahem. And so, with no further ado, it is my privilege to give the Prize Pony of Ponyville Award to our beloved guest of honor, a pony of the utmost trustworthiness, reliability, and integrity. Ponyville's most capable and dependable friend - Applejack!
104000 [crowd cheer]
104005 Cool! Way to go Applejack, that was awesome! I mean— heh.
104010 Ah-ahem.
104005 Awkward.
104008 I'm here. I'm here. [yawn] [sigh] Sorry I'm late—whoa—I was just... whoa... Did I get your tail? Miss Mayor. Thank you kindly for this here... award thingy. [yawn] It's so bright and shiny and, heh, heh heh, I sure do look funny heh. Ooo-ooo.
104007 Woo-ooo.
104008 Ooo-ooo.
104003 Okay... Well, thank you Applejack for saving us from that scary stampede, and always being there for everypony.
104008 [yawn] Yeah. I like helping the ponyfolks and [yawn] and stuff. [snore] Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, Thanks.
104000 [sounds of dragging metal]
104003 Was it just me, or did Applejack seem a little—
10400c Tired?
10400e Dizzy?
10400d Messy? Well, did you see her mane?
104007 She seemed fine to me. Woo! Woo!
104003 Hmm.
104008 [grunts] [sigh] Phew. [gasp] O-oah.
104003 What on Earth is that pony doing?
104008 Whoops.
104003 Hey Applejack!
104008 [snore]
104003 Applejack.
104008 [snore]
104003 Applejack. AppleJACK!
104008 Oh, howdy, Twilight.
104003 What is all this?
104008 It's Applebuck season. Whoa.
104003 Applewhat season?
104008 Neh, it's what the Apple family calls harvestin' time. We gather all the apples from the trees so we can sell 'em.
104003 But why are you doing it all alone?
104008 'Cause Big McIntosh hurt himself.
104003 What about all those relatives I've met when I first came to Ponyville? Can't they help?
104008 [sigh] They were just here for the Apple family reunion. They actually live all over Equestria and are busy harvestin' their own orchards. So, uh, I'm on my own. Which means, I should really get back to work. Ahem... hint hint? Get back to work?
104003 Fine.
104008 Could you step aside, Twilight?
104003 I just did. Applejack, you don't look so good.
104008 Eh, don't any of you three worry none, I'm just fine and dandy. Whoa.
104003 Do you... want some help?
104008 Help? No way, no how.
104003 But there's no way you can do it all on your own.
104008 Is that a challenge?
104003 Uhm... no?
104008 Well, I'm gonna prove to you that I can do it! Now if you'll excuse me, I've got apples to buck.
10400c There you are.
104008 [yawn] I'm a mite sorry, Rainbow. I was busy applebuckin' and I guess ah, I closed my eyes for a second and, when I woke up, I was late. Now, what's this new trick a' yours?
10400c See this contraption?
104008 Uh... Yeah.
10400c Well, I'm gonna stand on one end, then you're gonna jump down from that platform, launching me into the air faster than I can take off on my own. Once I'm in the air, I'm gonna do some amazing flips and spins that are sure to impress the Wonderbolts.
104008 Isn't that a mite dangerous?
10400c Pfft, Heh, not for a pony who can fly.
104008 Well, all right-y then. Oh my.
10400c Ready? One... two... THREE!
104008 [crash]
10400c Umm... maybe I wasn't clear. You're supposed to land on the other end.
104008 Got it. [grunt] [grunt] [grunt]
10400c Applejack, what the hay is going on? I mean, I thought I was working with Ponyville's best athlete!
104008 You are! I'm okay. Really. I-I have an idea! Watch this! [grunt] Ta-da! Oh... Maybe not. Okay, one more try! I'm sure to get it this time.
10400c Ugh! [groan]
104008 Heh heh... Here I go!
10400c Wait! Applejaaaaack!
104008 You're welcome!
10400c [grunt]
104003 Can I help you?
10400c I think somepony else needs your help.
104003 Applejack?
10400c Yep.
104008 Ow!
104003 Applejack, can we talk? Applejack, can we talk?
104008 Can bees squawk? I don't think so.
104003 No. Can we talk?
104008 Twenty stalks? Bean or celery?
104003 No! I need to talk to you!
104008 You need to walk to the zoo? Well, who's stoppin' you?
104003 I need to talk to you!
104008 Oh, well why didn't you say so? What you wanna talk about?
104003 Rainbow Dash dropped in to see me today.
104008 That's quite neighborly of her.
104003 Yes, except that she crashed onto my balcony after you launched her into the air.
104008 Oh, yeah. I wasn't feeling quite myself this morning.
104003 Because you're working too hard and you need help!
104008 What? Kelp? I don't need kelp. I don't even like seaweed!
104003 Help! You need help!
104008 Nothin' doin', Twilight. I'm gonna prove to you, t'everypony, that I can do this on my own! Ow! Now if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go help Pinkie Pie!
104003 Ugh.
10402a Now Pinkie Pie, are you sure you're up for baking the muffins and running the store this afternoon?
104007 Yes siree bob, Mrs Cake! Plus, I have Ponyville's prized pony to help me out. Why, she's the best baker ever! Right, Applejack?
10402b No? You're not the best baker ever?
104008 WHAT? Oh no! I mean, don't you fret. I can bake anything from fritters to pies in the blink of an eye.
10402a [sigh] All right. Well, see you later, girls!
104007 Stop with the shakin', it's time to get bakin'!
104007 All right-y! I'll get the sugar and the eggs. Can you get me some chocolate chips?
104008 Eh, uh, whu, what was that?
104007 Chocolate chips.
104008 Chips... got it. Tater chips, a little salty and dry, okie-dokie. What next?
104007 Baking soda.
104008 Soda. Perfect. That'll get the tater chips nice and wet. Now what?
104007 A cup of flour.
104008 A cup o' sour? Well, lemons are sure sour. One cup o' sour, comin' up. Anything else, Pinkie?
104007 One last thing. Wheat germ.
104008 Wheat worms? Oh, that must be fancy talk for earthworms.
104007 Now that's gonna be delicious.
104008 If you say so.
104007 Free muffin sample spectacular!
10400f [Mmm, muffins]
104008 Yeah! Muffin spectacles! Get 'em while they're hot.
104003 We came as soon as we heard.
10402c Oh thank you, Twilight. We need all the help we can get.
104000 [ponies moaning]
104003 Oh no! What happened?
104005 [sniff]
10402c It was a mishap with some of the baked goods.
104007 No, not baked goods... baked bads. [groans]
104003 Applejack.
104005 [chomp] Want one?
104008 [grunt] [snore] What? Huh? [grunt] [snore]
104003 Applejack, we need to talk.
104008 Wha, huh? Oh, it's you, Twilight. [yawn] I know what you're gonna say, but the answer is still no.
104003 Not to upset your applecart, but you need help.
104008 Hardy har. [groan] And no I don't.
104003 Here, let me help.
104008 Help? No thanks. [groan] A little more... [groan] Little... [grunt] There. I'll prove that this apple can handle these apples. Come on [grunt] apples! [grunt] Fall off! [grunt]
104003 AJ, think you're beating a dead... tree.
104008 I knew that.
104003 Actually, Applejack, I had something else to talk to you about. I just came back from Ponyville Urgent Care and—
104008 You know, I'm a little busy to get lectured right now, Twilight.
104003 But if you'd just let me help—
104008 Ugh. No, no, no! How many times do I gotta say it? I don't need no help from nopony!
104003 Ugh. That pony is stubborn as a mule.
104000 [mule braying]
104003 No offense.
10402d None taken.
10400e Oh, Applejack! Thank you so much for offering your herding skills for the annual rabbit roundup.
104008 Ugh. Why are we doin' this?
10400e Well, lots of new baby bunnies have been born, so it's my job to get a count of all the new families.
104008 Fine. Can we just get on with it?
10400e Certainly, but remember, these are bunnies we're dealing with, not cows. They're a timid bunch and need to be treated gently.
104008 I do NOT need any direction on corrallin' critters. Right, Winona?
104028 [barks]
10400e Okay, little bunnies! I need you to all gather here in the middle.
104008 That's right! Let's go, bunnies! In the center! Hop to it! Swell, just swell. Put 'em up, Winona!
104028 [barks]
10400e Applejack! Winona! Stop! You're scaring them!
104008 We know what we're doin'! Get along, little bunnies!
104028 [barks] [growls]
10400e Oh no.
10400c STAMPEDE!
104022 [yelps] Stampede!
104000 [ponies scream]
104000 [rabbits running]
10402e [sigh]
104003 [humming] [gasp]
10402f The horror, the horror!
10402e It was awful!
104022 A disaster! A horrible, horrible disaster!
104003 I don't get it.
10402e Our gardens, destroyed.
10402f Every last flower, devoured.
104022 By... by... them!
10400e Oh my. Oh... Please stop, little bunnies. Oh no! Please, let's go home. Oh my goodness!
104003 All right. Enough is enough.
104008 Must [gasp] keep [gasp] buckin'... just [gasp] a few [gasp] more. Must finish harvestin'.
104003 All right, Applejack. Your applebucking hasn't just caused you problems, it's over-propelled Pegasus', practically poisoned plenty of ponies, and terrorized bushels of brand new bouncing baby bunnies. I don't care what you say, you. Need. Help.
104008 [grunts] Ha! No, I don't! Look, I did it! I harvested the entire Sweet Apple Acres without your help. How d'ya like them apples?
104026 Um, how do you like them apples?
104008 [mumbling] Where'd all the apple...? [mumbling] [sighs]
104003 Applejack. Applejack.
104008 Huh?
104003 Oh, good, you're okay. Now Applejack, I completely respect the Apple family ways. You're always there to help anypony in need, so maybe you can put a little of your stubborn pride aside and allow your friends to help you.
104008 Okay, Twilight.
104003 I am not taking "no" for an answer— what?
104008 Yes, Twilight. Yes, please. I could really use your help.
104003 [chuckles] [sigh]
104003 Dear Princess Celestia,
104003 My friend Applejack is the best friend a pony could ever have, and she's always there to help anypony. The only trouble is, when she needs help, she finds it hard to accept it, so while friendship is about giving of ourselves to friends, it's also about accepting what our friends have to offer.
104003 Your faithful student,
104003 Twilight Sparkle
104008 How about y'all take a little break? I got some fine apple juice waitin' for ya! [sigh] Girls, I can't thank you enough for this help. I was acting a bit stubborn.
104003 A bit?
104008 Okay, a mite stubborn. And I'm awful sorry. Now, I know the town gave me the Prize Pony award, but the real award is having you five as my friends.
10400c Phew! That applebucking sure made me hungry!
104005 And I've got the perfect treat!
104007 Eeew... Spike, I threw those all away! Where'd you get them?
104005 From the trash.
10400f [in unison] EW!
104005 Just a little nibble? Come on!
10400f Ew! Gross!
104000 [music]
104000 [credits]
105007 Hoof-biting action overload! She was like a stunt superstar, flying higher and higher, and then Rainbow Dash swooped down—swoosh—and right before she hit the ground—shoom, she pulled up—vrrrmmm!
105003 Uh-huh.
105007 And then she looped around and around like whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!
105003 Uh-huh. Phew.
105007 Rainbow Dash!
10500c [groan] Pinkie Pie? Not again.
105007 Rainbow Dash.
10500c Not now, Pinkie Pie.
105007 But, but Rainbow Dash—
10500c I'm in the middle of something.
105007 But–
10500c I said not now— [grunt]
105007 I was gonna tell you to look out for that mountain.
10500c [groan]
105000 [theme song]
105007 [humming] Hi, I'm looking for Rainbow Dash. Have you seen her? Hi there, have you seen Rainbow Dash? Okay, thanks anyway. Twilight, have you seen Rainbow Dash anywhere?
105003 Isn't she right up there?
105007 Rainbow Dash!
10500c [grunt]
10500c Phew. That was close.
105007 Hi!
10500c Aah!
10500c [pants]
105007 Hi again.
10500c Aah!
105007 [spits] I need a favor, Rainbow Dash.
10500c Waaa— oh, forget it.
105007 I totally promise it'll be totally fun.
10500c [sighs] Okay.
105007 Over to the right. No, no, a little to the left. Oh wait, back to the right. Now a little leftish while staying rightly. Stop. Hmm. Maybe a few inches to the south. Now a couple centimeters north. Okay. One more smidgimeter to the—
10500c Pinkie Pie!
105007 Uh, I mean, perfect. Now wait for my signal.
105005 [humming]
105000 [thunder]
105005 D-aah! [hiccups]
105007 [laughing] Oh, Rainbow Dash, we startled Spike into getting the hiccups.
10500c [chuckles]
105005 [chuckles] Good one, Pinkie [hiccup] Pie. [hiccup] You're always pulling a fast one [hiccup] on me. [hiccup] Nnaa—
105007 Oh no! You're not hurt are you?
105005 Ne—[hiccup]—eh, don't be [hiccup] silly, dragons are [hiccup] fire-proof.
105007 Oh, okay, good.
105030 [laugh]
105005 I wish the same thing [hiccup] were true with scrolls.
105019 [gasp]
105030 [laugh]
105005 [hiccups]
105007 Have you ever seen anything more hilarious? [laughs]
10500c I can think of one thing.
105000 [thunder]
105007 Aah! [laughing and hiccuping]
10500c I didn't take you for a prankster, Pinkie Pie.
105007 Are you [hiccup] kidding? [hiccup] I love to pull pranks. It's all [hiccup] in good fun, and Pinkie Pie lo—[hiccup]—oves to have [hiccup] fun! [hiccup]
10500c You know, Pinkie Pie, you're not as annoying as I thought.
105007 [hiccup]
10500c You wanna hang out?
105007 [hiccup] That'd be [hiccup] I'd really [hiccup] When do [hiccup] I mean [hiccup] When would you [hiccup]
10500c A simple nod would do.
105007 Mmm-hmm.
105000 [doorbell]
10500c Is she even home?
105007 I don't know. This is gonna be gold!
105030 [snickering]
10500c There she is!
10500d Ooo. [sniffs] [sneezing]
105030 [laugh]
105007 Aaa-choo!
105003 Hmm?
105030 [laugh]
105008 [gasp] Land sakes!
105030 [chuckle]
105000 [splash]
105008 [chuckles]
105000 [squeaky toy]
105007 Is someone over there? Who're we gonna squirt? Who're we gonna squirt?
10500c [chuckles] Fluttershy.
105007 WHAT? [spits] Nononononono, we can't prank Fluttershy, I mean, she's so sensitive. It'll hurt her feelings, even our most harmless prank.
10500c Yeah, you're right. [raspberry] Huh. We need another victim who's made of tougher stuff. So, who's it gonna be?
105007 Oh, [chuckles] I've got someone in mind. [chuckles] The toughest around.
10500c Oh, awesome. Who? Who? Do I know them?
105007 [giggles] Oh, yes. [giggles] You're very close.
10500c [chuckles] Good one, Pinkie Pie.
105030 [laugh]
10500c Ridiculous.
105007 [blows party hooter] Rise and shine, Rainbow Dash! It's a brand new day and we got a lot of pranking to— Ooh.
10500c Mornin', Pinks. Gilda, this is my gal pal, Pinkie Pie.
105031 Hey. What's up?
10500c Pinkie, this is my griffon friend, Gilda.
105007 What's a griffon?
10500c She's half-eagle, half-lion.
105031 And all awesome. Raa. Heh-haa. Yeah, that's right.
10500c Gilda's my best friend from my days at Junior Speedster flight camp. Hey, remember the chant?
105031 Sha, they made us recite it every morning, I'll never get that lame thing out of my head.
10500c Sooo...
105031 Ugh. Only for you, Dash.
105000 [Rainbow Dash and Gilda]
105000 Junior Speedsters are our lives,
105000 Sky-bound soars and daring dives
105000 Junior Speedsters, it's our quest,
105000 To someday be the very best!
105007 [laughs] Oh that was awesome, and it gave me a great idea for a prank. Gilda, you game?
105031 Huh. Well, I groove on a good prank as much as the next griffon. But Dash, you promised me we'd get a flying session in this morning.
10500c Yeah, uh, well, Pinkie Pie, you don't mind, do you? Gilda just got here. We'll catch up with you later.
105007 Oh. Um, well sure, no problem. Have fun you guys, I'll, uh, just catch up with you— [sigh] later. [blows party hooter sadly]
105032 [laughing]
105031 Whoa, that was sweet. Just like old times.
10500c Yeah, only faster. So now what?
105007 Hey there.
105032 Huh?
105007 It's later. And I caught up.
10500c Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
105031 Hey Dash, think you got enough gas left to beat me to that cloud?
10500c A race? You are so on.
105031 One, two, three, go.
105007 Hey!
10500c I win.
105031 As if. I won, dude.
10500c No way.
105031 Yes way.
10500c Oh, come on, I was way ahead of you.
105031 Uh, I don't think so.
10500c Oh Geez, dream on.
105031 Remember back in camp? I–
10500c There is no way you beat me.
105031 Whatever.
105007 Wow guys, that was really close, but I think Rainbow Dash beat you by a teeny weeny itty bitty hair, or a teeny weeny itty bitty feather.
10500c Hah, see? Good thing Pinkie Pie's here to keep you honest, G.
105031 Okay... Dash, last one to that cloud up there is a gnarly dragon egg. Go! [To Pinkie Pie] I think the high altitude is making you dizzy.
105000 [balloons popping]
105007 Wait, guys! Oh wow, you guys almost got away from me that time.
105031 So, Dash, got any new moves in your tricktionary, or are you 100% old school?
10500c New moves? Heh, sit back G, this is gonna take a while.
105031 Hey Pinkie, c'mere.
105007 Yeah?
105031 Don't you know how to take get lost for an answer? Dash doesn't need to hang with a dweeb like you now that I'm around. You're dorkin' up the skies, Stinkie Pie, so make like a bee and BUZZ OFF.
105007 [gasp] Whaaa-aaa–
10500c Try matching that. Hey, where's Pinkie Pie and her crazy contraption?
105031 Eh, she left. Something about being as busy as a bee.
105007 Hmph!
105003 So Pinkie Pie, are you sure that this friend of Rainbow Dash is really so mean?
105007 Um, yeah. She keeps stealing Rainbow Dash away, she pops my balloons, and she told me to buzz off. I've never met a griffon this mean. Well, actually, I've never met a griffon at all, but I bet if I had, she wouldn't have been as mean and grumpy as Gilda.
105003 You know what I think, Pinkie Pie.
105007 Hmm?
105003 Well, I think... you're jealous.
105007 Jealous?
105005 Green with envy. Well, in your case, pink with envy.
105003 Well, yes. Jealous. Listen Pinkie, I don't want to upset you, but just because Rainbow Dash has another friend doesn't make Gilda a grump. I mean, perhaps it's you, Pinkie, who needs to improve her attitude.
105007 Improve my attitude? But I... d... b.. it's Gilda that... d... are you seri... [scream of frustration]
105003 [sigh]
105007 Maybe Twilight is right. Maybe Gilda isn't a big meanie grumpy mean-meanie-pants. Maybe I'm just a big jealous judgmental jealous-jealousy-pants. [sigh]
105007 [sips]
105031 [laughing] That was sweet!
10500c Ugh, I gotta take care of a few weather jobs around here. Shouldn't take long. Just, uh, hang out in town and I'll come find ya.
105031 That's cool, I guess. I'm gonna go chow down.
10500c Later.
105009 [sniffs] Aaah! A rattler, a rattler! Run for the hills! Everybody forsake yourselves!
105031 This stuff ain't fresh, dude.
105007 Aw, poor Granny Smith, she didn't know it was a joke! How mean! No, no, I can't misjudge her. It was kind of a funny prank, I guess.
105031 [chews]
105007 [gasp] I did misjudge her! She's not only a meanie mean-pants, she's also a thief! Nonononono, she might give it back. It's just a joke.
10500e All right, little ones, this way, this way. Mama duck, you're free and clear.
105031 Hey.
10500e Please excuse me.
105031 I'm walkin' here!
10500e Oh, um, I'm sorry. I-I-I was just trying to—
105031 [mocking] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Why don't you just watch where you're going, doofus?!
10500e B-b-b-but I... I...
105031 [inhales] [roars]
105000 [bleat]
10500e [sobs]
105031 Ugh, please, all these lame ponies are driving me buggy. I gotta bail.
105007 She's a grump, and a thief, and a bully! The meanest kind of mean meanie-pants there is! I can take it, but no one treats Fluttershy like that. No. One. This calls for extreme measures, Pinkie Pie style!
105007 Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
105008 Who's this Gilda I've heard nothing about?
10500d I hear she's an old friend of Rainbow Dash. A griffon, so rare.
105003 You've met Gilda, right? What's she like?
10500e Oh, um, well, I'll tell you later, Twilight.
105007 Welcome! Welcome!
10500e Um, Pinkie Pie, about this party for Gilda. Umm... do you really think it's a good idea? I mean—
105007 Don't worry your pretty little head about mean old Gilda. Your auntie Pinkie Pie's got it all taken care of.
10500e I'm a year older than you.
105007 Gilda! I'm so honored to throw you one of my signature Pinkie Pie parties, and I really, truly, sincerely, hope you feel welcome here amongst all us pony folk.
105031 [grunt]
105007 [laughs]
10500c [laughs] Oh Pinkie Pie, the old hoof-shake buzzer. You are a scream.
105031 Yeah [chuckles nervously] uh, good one, Pinkie Pie.
10500c Come on, G, I'll introduce you to some of my other friends.
105031 Right behind you, Dash! [to Pinkie Pie] I know what you're up to.
105007 Great.
105031 Rrrh. I know what you're planning.
105007 [giggles] Well, I hope so. This wasn't supposed to be a surprise party.
105031 I mean, I've got my eye on you.
105007 And I got my eye on you. Everyone, I'd like you all to meet Gilda, a long-time, dear friend of Rainbow Dash. Let's honor her and welcome her to Ponyville.
105000 [ponies cheer]
105007 Please help yourself.
105031 Vanilla lemon drops. Don't mind if I do. HOT!
10500c G, the punch!
105031 [gasp] [gulp] Huh?
105000 [laughter]
105007 Well, whaddya know, pepper in the vanilla lemon drops, and the punch served in a dribble glass!
10500c Ha! Priceless, priceless! [laughs]
105031 [gulp] [gasp] Yeah, hilarious.
10500c Hey, G, look! Presents!
105000 [pop]
105000 [laughter]
105008 Spittin' snakes. Hah, somepony pulled that prank on me last month.
105031 Ha ha. I bet I know who that was.
105007 You do?
105000 [ponies chatting, birds singing]
105007 Cake time, everypony!
105005 Hey, can I blow out the candles?
105003 Why don't we let Gilda blow out the candles, Spike? She is the guest of honor after all.
105005 [grunt]
105031 Exactly. [gasp] [blow] [gasp] [blow]
105000 [laughter]
105031 [continued gasping and blowing]
105005 [laughs] Re-lighting birthday candles! I love that prank! What a classic!
105007 Now, I wonder who could've done that.
105031 Yeah, I wonder.
105005 Mmm, who cares? This cake is amazing!
105003 Spike!
105005 What? It's great, try some.
10500c Hey G, you're not upset about some silly candles, are you?
105031 No way, Dash. Like I said, I'm down with a good prank.
10500c Come on then, let's have some cake.
105031 Hey, I'm watching you. Like a hawk.
105007 Why? Can't you watch me like a griffon?
105008 Hey, y'all, it's pin the tail on the pony! Let's play!
10500d Oh, my favorite game! Can I go first? Can I have the purple tail?
105031 Well, I am the guest of honor, and I'll have the purple tail.
105007 Yeah, Gilda should definitely go first. Let's get you blindfolded.
105031 Hey what— ugh— what are you doing? Rrrah!
105007 We're spinning you around and around and then you can pin the tail on the pony. Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail.
105031 [mockingly] Now just walk straight ahead and pin the tail. Hmph, yeah, right. This is another prank, isn't it? I'm going this way.
105007 Wait! The poster is this—
105031 Whoa whaa waah waah waaaaah! [grunt]
105000 [crash]
105007 Uh, Gilda? You pinned the tail on the wrong end.
105000 [ponies laugh]
105031 [roar] This is your idea of a good time?! I've never met a lamer bunch of dweebs in all my life! And Pinkie Pie, you! You are queen lame-o with your weak little party pranks! Did you really think you could make me lose my cool? Well, Dash and I have ten times as much cool as the rest of you put together! Come on, Dash, we're bailing on this pathetic scene. Come on, Rainbow Dash! I said, we're leaving!
10500c You know Gilda, I was the one who set up all those weak pranks at this party.
105031 [gasps] What?!
105007 Ooh!
10500c So I guess I'm queen lame-o.
105031 Come on, Dash, you're joshing me!
10500c They weren't all meant for you specifically, it was just dumb luck that you set them all off.
105007 I shoulda known, that dribble cup had Rainbow Dash written all over it.
105031 No way, i-it was Pinkie Pie! She set up this party to trip me up, to make a fool of me!
105007 Me? I threw this party to improve your attitude. I thought a good party might turn that frown upside down.
10500c And you sure didn't need any help making a fool of yourself. You know, this is not how I thought my old friends would treat my new friends. If being cool is all you care about, maybe you should go find some new cool friends someplace else.
105031 Rrgh... yeah? Well, you, you... you are such a, a flip-flop, cool one minute and lame the next. When you decide not to be lame anymore, gimme a call.
105000 [door slams]
105000 [hawk shriek]
10500c Not cool.
105005 Wow, talk about a party pooper.
105003 Wow, what was that about?
105000 [ponies talking indistinctly]
105033 Um, what just happened?
105034 Really awkward.
10500c I'm sorry, everypony, for bringing Gilda here. I didn't know how rude she was. And Pinkie Pie, I'm really sorry she ruined that awesome party you put on for her.
105007 Hey, if you want to hang out with party poopers, that's your business.
10500c I'd rather hang out with you. No hard feelings?
105007 No hard feelings!
105000 [laughter]
105003 Hey, Pinkie. Sorry I accused you of misjudging Gilda. Looks like I'm the one who misjudged you.
105007 It's okay, Twilight, even you can't be a super smart smarty smart-pants all the time. Come on, everypony, there's still a whole lotta party to finish!
105000 [ponies cheer]
105003 Dearest Princess Celestia,
105003 Today I learned that it's hard to accept when somepony you like wants to spend time with somepony who's not so nice. Though it's impossible to control who your friends hang out with, it is possible to control your own behavior. Just continue to be a good friend. In the end, the difference between a false friend and one who's true will surely come to light.
105003 Your faithful student,
105003 Twilight Sparkle
105019 Dear Twilight Sparkle,
105019 My most faithful student... Oh! Heh, wrong ink. [sigh] [chuckles]
105000 [music]
105000 [credits]
106005 Come on, Twilight. You can do it!
106003 Okay, here goes.
106000 [magical chime]
106005 Ha ha! Ya did it! Growing magic, that's number twenty-five. Twenty-five different types of tricks and counting. And I think this is the best trick so far. Hello, Rarity. What's that? Aw, it's nothin', just my awesome mustache. [laughter]
106003 Sorry, Romeo. As attractive and enticing as you look, it's just for practice, and it's gotta go.
106005 Wait! Aw, rats!
106003 [laughter]
106000 [theme song]
106005 Twenty-five, Twilight. Twenty-five different kinds of tricks and counting. I thought unicorns were only supposed to have a little magic that matches their special talents!
106003 True, for ponies whose talents are for things like cooking or singing or math. But what if a unicorn's special talent is magic?
106005 Like you, Twilight, and you know a ton of magic.
106003 Oh, Spike, stop. I'm sure there are lots of ponies right here in Ponyville that know just as much magic as me.
106005 Are you kiddin'? I don't think there's another unicorn in all of Equestria with your kind of ability, Twilight.
106035 Gangway! Comin' through!
106005 Augh! Snips, Snails! What's goin' on?
106035 Wha, haven't you heard?
106005 Whoa!
106035 There's a new unicorn in town!
106036 Yeah! They say that she's got more magical powers than any other unicorn ever!
106003 Really?
106005 Aw, no way, that honor goes to Twilight here.
106003 Where is this unicorn?
106035 Ho, she's in the town square. Come on!
106036 Yeah! [laughter] Come on! Whooo!
106037 Come one, come all! Come and witness the amazing magic of the Great and Powerful Trixie!
106038 Ooh!
106037 Watch in awe as the Great and Powerful Trixie performs the most spectacular feats of magic ever witnessed by pony eyes!
106000 [fireworks and fanfare]
10600d My, my, my! What boasting!
106005 Come on, nopony's as magical as Twi— Twi— Twi— Oh! [clears throat] Hey, Rarity, I, uh— Mustache!
106003 There's nothing wrong with being talented, is there?
106008 Nothin' at all, 'cep'n when someone goes around showin' it off like a school filly with fancy new ribbons.
10600d Just because one has the ability to perform lots of magic does not make one better than the rest of us.
10600c Especially when ya got me around being better than the rest of us. Heh... Uh, I mean, yeah, uh, magic shmagic. Boo!
106037 Well, well, well, it seems we have some neighsayers in the audience. Who is so ignorant as to challenge the magical ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie? Do they not know that they're in the presence of the most magical unicorn in all of Equestria?
10600d [raspberry] Just who does she think she is?
106005 Yeah! Since we all know that Twilight here is—
106003 Spike! Shhh!
106005 What? What's wrong?
106003 You see the way they reacted to Trixie? I don't want anyone thinking I'm a show-off.
106000 [fanfare]
10600c So, "Great and Powerful Trixie". What makes you think you're so awesome, anyway?
106037 Heh, why, only the Great and Powerful Trixie has magic strong enough to vanquish the dreaded ursa major!
106000 [fanfare, fireworks]
106038 Ahh!
106036 What?
106035 No way!
106037 When all hope was lost, the ponies of Hoofington had no one to turn to. But the Great and Powerful Trixie stepped in and, with her awesome magic, vanquished the ursa major and sent it back to its cave deep within the Everfree Forest!
106039 Saw, sweet!
106036 That settles it.
106035 Trixie truly is the most talented, the most magical, the most awesome unicorn in Ponyville.
106036 No, in all of Equestria!
106005 How do you know? You didn't see it! And besides, Twi— [zip] Mmph! M-mmph!
106037 [laughter] It's true, my enthusiastic little admirers. Trixie is most certainly the best in Ponyville.
106000 [crickets]
106037 Don't believe the Great and Powerful Trixie? [chuckles] Well then, I hereby challenge you, Ponyvillians. Anything you can do, I can do better. Any takers? Anyone? Hmm? Or is Trixie destined to be the greatest equine who has ever lived?!
106000 [fireworks and fanfare]
106005 [zip] Please! She's unbearable! Ya gotta show her! Ya just gotta! [cries]
106003 There's no way I'm going to use my magic now, Spike. Especially since—
106037 Hmm, how about you?
106003 [gulps]
106000 [music]
106037 Well, how about it? Hm? Is there anything you can do that the Great and Powerful Trixie can't?
106003 I— I—
106037 Well, little hayseed?
106008 That's it! I can't stand for no more of this!
106005 You show her, AJ!
106008 Can your magical powers do this?
106000 [banjo music]
106038 Whooo! [cheers]
106008 Top that, missy.
106037 Oh ye of little talent. Watch and be amazed at the magic of Trixie!
106000 [snake charmer music]
106008 Whoa! Uh!
106038 [laughter and cheers]
106037 Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie prevails.
10600c There's no need to go struttin' around and showin' off like that.
106037 Oh?
10600c That's my job!
106000 [electric guitar music]
10600c They don't call me "Rainbow" and "Dash" for nothin'!
106038 [cheers]
106037 When Trixie is through, the only thing they'll call you is loser.
106000 [rapid music]
10600c Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-a-a-a! [gulp] I think I'm [gulp] gonna be sick.
106037 Seems like anypony with a dash of good sense would think twice before tussling with the Great Trixie.
106000 [thunder]
10600c Ow!
106000 [laughter]
106005 What we need is another unicorn to challenge her. Someone with some magic of her own.
10600c Yeah! A unicorn to show this unicorn who's boss.
106008 A real unicorn to unicorn tussle.
106003 Uh...
10600d Enough. Enough, all of you. I take your hint, but Rarity is above such nonsense. Rainbow Dash and Applejack may behave like ruffians, but Rarity conducts herself with beauty and grace.
106037 Ooo, what's the matter? Afraid you'll get a hair out of place in that rat's nest you call a mane?
10600d Oh, it. Is. On! You may think you're tough with all of your so-called powers, but there's more to magic than your brutish ways. A unicorn needs to be more than just muscle. A unicorn needs to have style.
106038 Ooh!
10600d A unicorn is not a unicorn without grace and beauty.
106005 Rarity won't let Trixie get the best of her! She's strong, she's beautiful, she's—
106038 [gasps]
10600d Quick! I need a mirror! Get me a mirror! What did she do to my hair? I know she did something terrible to my hair!
106003 Nothing.
10600c It's fine.
106008 It's gorgeous.
106005 It's green. What?
10600d Ugh, no. Green hair! Not green hair! [cries] Such an awful, awful color! [cries]
10603a Well, I never!
106005 Well Twilight, guess it's up to you. Come on, show her what you're made of.
106003 What do you mean? I'm nothing special.
106005 Yes, you are! You're better than her!
106003 I'm not better than anyone.
106037 Hah! You think you're better than the Great and Powerful Trixie? You think you have more magical talent? Well, come on, show Trixie what you've got. Show us all.
106003 Who, me? I'm just your run-of-the-mill citizen of Ponyville. No powerful magic here. I, uh... I think I hear my laundry calling. Sorry, gotta go.
106005 Twilight?
106037 Ha! Once again, the Great and Powerful Trixie has proven herself to be the most amazing unicorn in all of Equestria. Huh, was there ever any doubt?
106036 Here's the oat smoothie you asked for, with extra hay, just how you like it.
106035 Mmm, hay.
106037 [sips] Yes?
106036 Ooo, tell us another story, Great and Powerful Trixie.
106035 Yeah, tell us about how you vanquished the ursa major.
106037 Guh! Trixie is far too exhausted from performing feats beyond imagination. Begone with you until morning.
106035 Oh, of course, Great and Powerful Trixie.
106036 Anything you say. We are at your beck and call.
106037 Ah.
106005 What are you two doin'?
106036 Just bringin' the Gee an' Pee Tee a—
106005 The what?
106036 The Great and Powerful Trixie.
106005 Sheesh.
106036 Just bringin' her a smoothie.
106005 How can you fall for her lameness? She's just a show-off. Unlike Twilight, who—
106036 The Great and Powerful Trixie vanquished an ursa major. Can your Twilight claim that?
106005 Oh really? Were you guys actually there?
106036 Well, eh, uh... no, but—
106005 But nothin'. The proof is in the pudding.
106035 [laughs] I like pudding.
106005 Look, unless an ursa major comes waltzing up the street for Trixie to vanquish, I am not gonna believe a word she says, and neither should you!
106036 Hm, an ursa walkin' up the street, hey? Snails! You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
106035 Why is it they call it a flea market when they don't really sell fleas?
106036 Yeah, uh... oh, come on!
106005 Twilight, would you put down that book and just listen to me?
106003 Didn't you see how they hated Trixie's bragging, Spike? If I go out there and show off my magic, I run the risk of losing them as friends.
106005 It's not the same thing, Twilight. You'll be using your magic to stand up for your friends!
106003 No, Spike, it's exactly the same.
106005 Come on, Twilight, any one of these tricks, even the teeniest, would be enough to show up Trixie.
106003 I don't want to be seen as a bragger like Trixie.
106000 [door slam, door open]
106005 But you're the best!
106003 Uh. Please, Spike, I said no!
106005 [sighs] If that's the way you want to be, then fine.
106000 [door slam, door open]
106000 [spooky music and sounds]
106036 Oh, how we gonna find an ursa major when I can't even see my own hoof in front of my face?
106035 Hold on. [grunts]
106036 Oh, heh. That's better.
106000 [growl]
106035 Yaaaah!
106036 Yaaaah!
10603b [roar]
106036 [screaming]
106005 Hey, guys, where ya goin'?
106035 [breathing hard]
106036 Can't talk now.
106035 Got a major problem!
106036 Yeah, ursa major, to be exact.
106000 [roar]
106005 Huh?
10603b [roar]
106039 Trixie!
106005 Twilight!
106000 [banging on door]
106039 Trixie! [mingled speech]
106037 Trixie thought she said the Great and Powerful Trixie did not want to be disturbed!
106036 [nervous laughter] We— We have a— a tiny problem.
106035 Actually, it's a big one.
106037 What is so important that you cannot wait until morning to disturb Trixie?
106000 [roar]
10603b [roar]
106037 [screams]
106039 [screams]
10603b [roar]
106005 Twilight! You've gotta come! Quick!
106003 I already told you, Spike, I don't wanna show up Trixie!
106005 No, you don't understand, it's—
106000 [roar]
106003 Uh, is that what I think it is?
106005 Majorly.
106036 Great and Powerful Trixie, you've got to vanquish the ursa.
106035 Yeah, vanquish so we can watch.
106036 It took a lot of trouble to get that thing here.
106037 Wait, you brought this here? [gasp] Are you out of your little pony minds?
106036 But, you're the Great and Powerful Trixie.
106035 Yeah, remember? You defeated an ursa major.
10603b [roar]
106037 Uh, okay. [gulp] Stand back.
106000 [snake charmer music]
106037 Heh. Piece of cake.
106000 [growls, snap]
106036 Aw, come on, Trixie.
106035 Stop goofin' around and vanquish it, eh?
106037 [gasp, gulp]
106000 [thunder]
106035 Well, that was a dud.
106036 Yeah, pfft, come on! Where's all the cool explosions and smoke and stuff like earlier? You know.
106000 [crackle]
106037 Uh-oh.
10603b [roar]
10603c [screams]
10603b [roar]
106000 [ponies gasp]
10603b [roar]
106000 [crash]
106000 [ponies crying in fear]
106003 What's going on?
106036 We brought an ursa to town.
106003 You what?!
106035 Don't worry, the Great and Powerful Trixie will vanquish it.
106037 I can't.
106039 What?!
106037 Oh, I can't, I never have. No one can vanquish an ursa major. I just made the whole story up to make me look better.
106039 Made it up?!
10603b [growl] [roar]
106000 [ponies gasp]
106003 [gulp]
10603b [growl]
106003 [groans]
106000 [wind]
106000 [music from broken cattails]
10603b [growl] [grunt] [guttural sigh]
106005 Nice use of number sixteen.
106000 [metallic sounds]
106000 [water flowing]
106000 [milking sounds and moos]
10603d Golly, dont'cha know?
106005 That's new.
106000 [metallic clank]
106003 [groans]
10603b [sucking]
106000 [cheering]
10600c Unbelievable!
106005 That was amazing!
106008 Heavens to Betsy! We knew you had ability, but not that much!
106003 I'm sorry. Please, please don't hate me.
10603e Hate you?
10600d Why, whatever do you mean, darling?
106003 Well, I know how much you all hated Trixie's showing off with her magic tricks, and I just thought—
10600c Whoa, whoa, whoa. Magic's got nothing to do with it. Trixie's just a loudmouth.
10600d Most unpleasant.
106008 All hat and no cattle.
106003 So, you don't mind my magic tricks?
106008 Your magic is a part of who you are, sugarcube, and we like who you are. We're proud to have such a powerful, talented unicorn as our friend.
10600c And after whuppin' that ursa's hindquarters, we're even prouder.
106003 You are?
10600c Uh-huh.
106008 Mm-hmm.
10600d Mm-hmm.
106005 Wow, Twilight, how'd you know what to do with that ursa major?
106003 That's what I was doing when you came looking for me. I was so intrigued by Trixie's bragging that I was compelled to do a little reading up on them.
106005 So it is possible to vanquish an ursa major all by yourself?
106003 That wasn't an ursa major. It was a baby, an ursa minor.
106037 That was just a baby?
106003 And it wasn't rampaging. It was just cranky because someone woke it up.
106039 Awww...
106005 Well, if that was an ursa minor, then what's an ursa major like?
106003 You don't wanna know.
106037 Huh. You may have vanquished an ursa minor, but you will never have the amazing, show-stopping ability of the Great and Powerful Trixie!
106000 [retreating hoofbeats]
10600c Why, that little...
106003 Just let her go. Maybe someday she'll learn her lesson. Now, about you two.
106036 Ah [nervous laughter]. Uh, we're sorry that we woke up the ursa minor.
106035 We just wanted to see some awesome magic.
106036 Yeah! And the way you vanquished that ursa minor was awesome!
106035 We deserve whatever punishment you give us.
106003 For starters, you can clean up this mess. And... What do you think, Spike? Should I give them number twenty five?
106005 Oh, twenty five! Yes! And I think I deserve it, too.
106039 Heah?
106003 I think you're right.
10603f Sweet!
106003 Dear Princess Celestia,
106003 I have learned a very valuable lesson about friendship - I was so afraid of being thought of as a show-off that I was hiding a part of who I am. My friends helped me realize that it's okay to be proud of your talents, and there are times when it's appropriate to show them off... Especially when you're standing up for your friends.
106005 So, you finally admit that you're the most talented unicorn in all of Ponyville?
106003 Well, yeah, but it's nothing to brag about. So, uh, how did it go with Rarity?
106005 Eh, she didn't go for the mustache.
106003 You know, Spike, that mustache has nothing to do with who you really are. Maybe you should just try being yourself.
106005 Or... Maybe the mustache wasn't enough. Maybe if I had a mustache and a beard?
106003 Uh, not this again!
106005 Okay, imagine me with a nice, long, Fu Manchu type beard. Or maybe a goatee. Oh, no, a soul patch right on my chin!
106000 [music]
106000 [credits]
10700e [spits] Not too fast now, Angel Bunny. You don't wanna get a tummy ache. [chuckles] You really should eat more than that, don't you think? It's not play time yet. I know you want to run, but... just three more bites. Two more bites? One more bite? Pretty please? [sighs]
107040 [coughs]
10700e Oh, goodness. Are you okay?
107040 [coughs]
10700e Are you coughing because there's a carrot stuck in your throat?
107040 [coughs]
10700e Because you need some water?
107040 [coughs loudly]
10700e [gasp] Because of that giant cloud of scary black smoke? I'll take that as a... yes.
107000 [theme song]
107000 [ponies conversing in the background]
10700e Help. Help! Please? Help? There's— there's a horrible cloud of smoke. It's headed this way and— [shrieks]
10700c Don't be such a scaredy-pony. It's just me, future Equestria ball-bouncing record holder. Three forty six, three forty seven...
107007 This calls for a celebration!
10700e Oh, no, Pinkie Pie, this is no time for celebration. This is a time for panic, for—
107007 Ooo! I'm going to need balloons! One for every pony in Ponyville!
10700e There's— there's smoke. And— and where there's smoke, there's fire. And—
107007 Let's see, that's one, two, three, four...
10700c Three hundred fifty four...
107007 Five, six...
10700c Three hundred fifty five, no, wait...
107007 Seven.
10700c Pinkie Pie! Now I have to start over.
10700e We're all going to have to start over, in a new village. 'Cause ours is gonna be—
107007 Hey, Rainbow Dash, wait up!
10700e Oh, please, this is an emergency. I-I need everypony to—
107003 Listen up! Smoke is spreading over all of Equestria.
10700f What? Oh no! That's awful!
10700e That's what I've been trying to—
107003 But don't worry, I've just received a letter from Princess Celestia informing me that it is not coming from a fire.
10700e Oh, thank goodness.
107003 It's coming from a dragon.
10700f [gasp]
10700e A... d-dragon?
107008 What in the name of all things cinnamon swirled is a full-grown dragon doing here in Equestria?
107003 Sleeping.
107018 Huh?
107003 According to Princess Celestia, he's taking a nap. His snoring is what's causing all this smoke.
107007 He should really see a doctor. That doesn't sound healthy at all.
10700d Well, at least he's not snoring fire. What are we meant to do about it?
10700c I'll tell you what we're meant to do - give him the boot! Take that. And that!
107000 [crash]
107003 We need to encourage him to take a nap somewhere else. Princess Celestia has given us this mission, and we must not fail. If we do, Equestria will be covered in smoke for the next one hundred years.
10700e [gasp]
10700d Hmph. Talk about getting your beauty sleep.
107003 All right everypony, I need you to gather supplies quickly. We've got a long journey ahead of us. Let's meet back here in less than an hour.
10700c Okay, girls, you heard her. The fate of Equestria is in our hooves. Do we have what it takes?
107041 [affirmations]
10700e Um, actually...
10700c Raaah!
107008 Yaaa!
107000 [pop whistles]
107007 [laughter] Oh, I mean, grrr!
10700d Ewww! Much better. Onward!
10700e [squeak]
107008 Let's go!
10700e Um, let's... not? [squeak]
107003 All right girls, listen up. I'm mapping out the fastest route, but we've all got to keep a good pace if we expect to make it up the mountain by nightfall.
10700e M-m-mountain?
107003 The dragon is in that cave at the very top.
107008 Looks pretty cold up there.
10700c You bet it is. The higher you go, the chillier it gets.
10700d Good thing I brought my scarf.
107007 Ooo! Pretty!
10700c [sarcastically] Heh, oh yeah. That'll keep you nice and cozy.
10700e [gulp] Um, excuse me, Twilight? I know you're busy, but...
107003 Uh-huh. Well, we could go this way.
10700e But if I could just have a second...
107003 Uh-huh. No, we want to avoid that.
10700e So, um, I was thinking that, um, maybe I should just stay here in Ponyville.
107003 Uh-huh.
10700e Oh! Good. I'll stay here and—
107003 Wait! You have to come! Your way with wild animals will surely come in handy.
10700e I don't think I—
107003 Oh, and don't worry about your little friends in the meadow. Spike's got it covered while you're gone.
107005 You can count on me! Oooh! Hey! Hey! Wait!
10700e I don't really think he's up to the task. Maybe... but... but... [squeak]
10700c Are you sure you want Fluttershy to come along? I mean, that pony's afraid of her own shadow. She's just going to slow us down.
107003 Oh, she's just a little nervous. Once we get going, I'm sure she'll be fine.
10700e [squeal]
107003 All right girls, move out!
10700e But... but...! [scream]
107000 [dragon snore]
10700e [gasp]
10700c Whoa. What was that?
107003 That is what it sounds like when a dragon snores.
10700e It— it's so... high!
10700c Well, it is a mountain. I'm going to fly up there and check it out! Wah!
107008 Hold on, now. I think we should all go up together. Safety in numbers and all.
10700c Oh, all right.
10700d I hear the only thing that sparkles more than a dragon's scales are the jewels they use to build their nests. Ooo, if I play my cards right, I might be able to convince him to part with a few!
107007 [imitating a dragon] Welcome to my cave, Rarity. Care for a diamond? [roar]
107000 [laughter]
107003 Girls! This is no laughing matter! Fluttershy, you're the expert on wild creatures. What do you think the dragon will be like? Fluttershy?
10700c Hey! What are you waiting for? An invitation?
107007 Ooo, I think I have one in my bag!
107000 [pop whistles]
107000 [cheering SFX]
10700e I-it's so... so... steep.
10700c Well, it is a cliff. You could just, oh, I don't know, fly up here?
107007 Come on, Fluttershy, you can do it. Flap those wings!
10700e Oh... okay. [soft cry]
107000 [dragon snore]
10700e [whimpers]
10700c Ugh.
10700e [soft grunts]
107003 Uh, we don't have time for this. What are you doing?
107008 I'll need this if I'm going to take her around the mountain another way.
10700c [groan] Around the mountain? That's going to take them forever.
10700e [squeals]
107000 [dragon snore]
107000 [goat bleat]
107008 Don't worry, Twi. We'll be there lickety-split.
107007 Whoo-hoo! I win again!
10700d Ugh. That's thirty-five games in a row. Best of seventy-one?
107008 [panting] We. Made. It. [panting]
10700c Told you it was going to take them forever.
10700e [gulp]
107003 Your turn, Fluttershy.
10700e But... it's so... wide.
107003 Come on, Fluttershy, we should be much farther along by now.
107008 You could just leap on over.
10700e I—
107000 [dragon snore]
10700e I don't know.
107007 There's nothing to be afraid of. It's just a hop, skip and a jump. See?
107007 [Pinkie Pie]
107007 It's not very far
107007 Just move your little rump
107007 You can make it if you try with a hop, skip and jump
107003 We don't have time for this.
107007 [Pinkie Pie]
107007 A hop, skip and jump,
107007 Just move your little rump,
107007 A hop, skip and jump,
107007 A hop, skip and jump,
107007 A hop, skip and jump,
107007 A hop skip and jump,
107007 A hop skip and jump!
10700e O-okay. Here I go. A hop...
107008 That's it.
107003 You've got it.
10700d Almost there.
10700e Skip...
107003 Just don't look down.
10700e [whimpers]
10700c Ugh.
10700e I guess I forgot to jump.
107003 [whispers] Let's keep it down. According to my map, we're entering an avalanche zone. The smallest peep could cause a huge rock slide.
10700e An... an ava... ava...
107003 Shhh!
10700e AVALA—!
107000 [collective sigh]
107000 [rumble]
10700f Avalanche! [cries]
107003 Oh no! Help! Ooh!
107000 [coughing]
107008 Oh my! [stops coughing] Everypony okay?
107003 Thanks to you I am.
10700d Eugh. Blech.
107007 Whoo-hoo! Let's do it again!
10700d Uh! This is why a girl always packs extra accessories. Oh, please tell me I brought the tiara that goes with this.
10700c Uh, think we got bigger problems than making sure our hair bows match our horseshoes.
10700e [sigh] Sorry.
107008 Aw, no big whoop, sugarcube.
107003 Yeah, we'll just have to [sigh] climb over.
107000 [grunts]
10700e [sigh] [whimpers]
10700d [cry]
107008 Wha! Wha...
10700d My apologies.
10700c Not your fault.
10700e [whimper]
10700c [sigh] Still think it was a good idea to bring Fluttershy along?
107003 We're about to find out. We're here.
107003 Rainbow Dash, you'll use your wings to clear the smoke.
10700c Mm-hmm.
107003 Rarity and Pinkie Pie, you'll create a diversion to distract the dragon if things get a little hairy in there.
107000 [squeaky toy]
107003 Applejack, you're ready with the apples in case he decides to attack. But it shouldn't come to that, because Fluttershy will do what she needs to do to wake him up, and between the two of us, we should be able to get him to understand why he needs to go. Is everypony ready?
107000 [affirmatives]
107003 Okay then, we're goin' in. So, what is the best way to wake up a sleeping dragon without upsetting him? Fluttershy? Oh, come on! Come on! [grunt] We have to do this! [grunt] Now! Every [grunts] second longer that dragon [grunts] sleeps is another [grunts] acre of Equestria that is covered in [grunts] smoke. Ooh!
107007 [laugh]
10700e I— I— I can't go in the cave.
10700f Ugh. [crash]
10700c Oh, great. She's scared of caves now, too.
10700e I'm not scared of caves, I'm scared of [mumble].
107008 What's that, sugarcube?
10700e I'm scared of [mumble].
107003 What?
10700e I'm scared of dragons!
107000 [dragon snore]
10700e [squeal]
107000 [coughing]
107003 But Fluttershy, you have a wonderful talent dealing with all kinds of animals.
10700e Yes, because they're not dragons.
10700c Oh, come on! We've seen you walk right up to a horrible manticore like it was nothing.
10700e Yes, because he wasn't a dragon.
107007 Spike is a dragon. You're not scared of him.
10700e Yes, because he's not a huge, gigantic, terrifying, enormous, teeth-gnashing, sharp-scale having, horn-wearing, smoke-snoring, could eat a pony in one bite, totally all grown-up dragon!
107000 [dragon snore]
10700e [whimper]
107003 But, if you're so afraid of dragons, why didn't you say something before we came all the way up here?
10700e I was afraid to.
10700c Ugh.
107008 All of us are scared of that dragon.
10700c I'm not!
107008 Almost all of us are scared of that dragon, but we've got a job to do. So, get in there with Twilight and show her what you're made of.
10700e I— I— I just... can't.
107003 Oh, Fluttershy.
107003 I'm goin' in. He... probably just doesn't realize what he's doing... right?
107000 [ponies agree nervously]
107003 Mr Dragon.
107042 [rumble]
107003 Excuse me.
107042 [rumble]
107003 Mr Dragon.
107042 [rumble]
107003 Oh, good, you're awake. Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Twilight—
107042 [yawn]
107003 Augh! Puh! Sparkle, and my friends and I are residents here in Equestria. Ponyville, to be exact. We've come here to ask that you find another spot to take your nap. It's just that you seem to be doing an awful lot of snoring, and every time you do you send out a terrible cloud of smoke. [coughs] Equestria simply can't survive a hundred years in a dark haze. You understand, don't you?
107042 [stretches] [grunts]
107003 So, you'll find another place to sleep? [coughs]
107042 [huff]
10700f [coughing]
10700c So much for [coughs] persuading him.
107008 Now what?
10700d [coughs] Obviously, this situation just calls for a little "pony charm". Allow me, girls. [to Razor] I'm so sorry to interru-upt, [clears throat] but I couldn't possibly head back home without mentioning what handsome scales you have. And those scales have to be hidden away in some silly cave for a hundred years?
107042 [rumble]
10700d Personally, I think you should skip the snoozing and be out there, showing them off! Hmm. Obviously, I would be more than happy to keep an eye on your jewels while you're gone.
107042 [growl]
10700d [cry]
10700d I was this close to getting that diamond.
107003 You mean... getting rid of that dragon?
10700d Oh, yeah... sure.
107000 [horn]
107008 What in tarnation...?
107007 [horn]
10700d Darling, you look ridiculous.
107007 Exactly! Sharing a laugh is a sure-fire way to get someone on your side! Hi!
107000 [crash]
107007 Apparently he doesn't like laughing, heh. Or sharing.
10700c All right, that's it. We tried persuasion, charm... whatever it is Pinkie Pie does...
107007 [busted horn]
10700c It's time to stop wasting time! I'm going in!
107003 Rainbow, no!
10700c Get! Out! [smack]
107042 [sneeze] [growl]
10700c Heh. Sorry.
107042 [roars]
10700c Who-o-o-o-o-a!
107000 [tenpins]
10700f Ugh!
107000 [roar]
107000 [screams]
107042 [roar]
10700f [moans]
107042 [rumble]
10700f [moans]
10700e How dare you... How dare you! Listen here, mister. Just because you're big doesn't mean you get to be a bully! You may have huge teeth, and sharp scales, and snore smoke, and breathe fire. But you do not—I repeat—you do not! Hurt! My! Friends! You got that?
107042 [whimper]
10700e Well?
107042 But that rainbow one kicked me.
10700e And I am very sorry about that. But you're bigger than she is, and you should know better. You should also know better than to take a nap where your snoring can become a health hazard to other creatures.
107042 But I—
10700e Don't you 'but I' me, mister. Now what do you have to say for yourself? I said, what do you have to say for yourself?!
107042 [whimper] [crying]
10700e There, there. No need to cry. You're not a bad dragon, you just made a bad decision. Now go pack your things. You just need to find a new place to sleep. That's all.
10700f [cheering]
107003 You did it! I knew you could do it!
107005 [pant] I said come back here! Ooh! How does Fluttershy put up with you furry little things?
107003 Spike, take a letter.
107005 [sigh] With pleasure.
107003 Dear Princess Celestia,
107003 I am happy to report that the dragon has departed our fair country, and that it was my good friend, Fluttershy, who convinced him to go. This adventure has taught me to never lose faith in your friends. They can be an amazing source of strength, and can help you overcome even your greatest fears.
107003 Always your faithful student,
107003 Twilight Sparkle.
107008 Twilight! You gotta come see this! She's just five away from a new pony record!
10700c Three hundred forty-seven, three hundred forty-eight...
107000 [roar]
10700c Dragon!
107000 [goat bleat]
107000 [laughter]
10700c [pants] Why are you laughing? That awful dragon is back!
107007 [roar]
10700c Pinkie Pie, you scared me! I mean, uh, you... broke my concentration.
10700e It's okay, Rainbow Dash. Not everypony can be as brave as me. [scream]
107000 [goat bleat]
107000 [laughter]
107000 [music]
107000 [credits]
108008 [groans]
10800d Hmm. Hah! Perfect.
108008 [spit] Just take the broken limbs down, Rarity. Don't y'all care about nothin' other than prettifyin'?
10800d Somepony has to. You were making an absolute mess of the town square, Applejack.
108008 Yeah, well, the storm's gonna make an even bigger mess if we don't prune all these loose branches so they don't tumble down on anypony.
10800d I simply cannot imagine why the Pegasus ponies would schedule a dreadful downpour this evening and ruin what could have been a glorious sunny day.
108008 [sigh] Think more practical-like, will ya? They accidentally skipped a scheduled sprinkle last week, so we need a doozy of a downpour to make up for it, is all.
108000 [rainfall]
10800d Oh no! My wonderfully styled mane shall be ruined!
108008 Ya shoulda hurried up and finished the job already.
10800d Oh! Ah! Oh! Ph! It's coming down too fast! Ah! Oh! Oh! Ah! Help me!
108008 Uh, there. Hunker down to yer heart's content whilst I finish things.
10800d [pant] Oh, no, no, no!
108008 What now?
10800d I prefer not to get my hooves muddy.
108008 Guh. There is just no pleasin' ya, is there? Everything's got to be just so.
10800d [scoff] Well, and how does muddying my hooves serve any useful purpose?
108008 Y'all wouldn't know useful if it came up and bit'cha.
10800d [laugh] That doesn't even make any sense.
108008 Does so.
10800d Does not.
108008 Does so.
10800d Does not.
108008 Does so.
10800d Does not.
108008 Does so infinity. Hah.
10800d Does not infinity plus one. Heh. What say we go our separate ways before one of us says something she will regret?
108008 I reckon y'all are gonna say something you'll regret first.
10800d On the contrary, I believe it shall most certainly be you who says something you will regret first.
108008 I'm not sayin' anythin'.
10800d Nor am I.
108008 Y'all just be on yer way, then.
10800d After you!
108000 [thunder cracks]
108043 [yelp]
10800d Perhaps we should stick together for now and find some shelter.
108008 Uh-huh, perhaps we should. And fast.
108000 [theme song]
108008 Heh. Nice and dry under here, sorta.
10800d Oh! Unacceptable.
108003 Applejack! Rarity! Applejack! Rarity!
108043 Twilight?
108003 Come inside girls, quick.
108008 Whoa, nelly. Is inside a tree really the best place to be in a lightning storm?
108003 It is if you have a magical lightning rod protecting your home like I do. Come on in!
10800d Hah! We are most grateful for your invitation.
108008 Thank ya kindly for yer hospitality.
10800d Uh, do be a polite house guest and go wash up please, won't you?
108008 [grumble] If I gotta spend one more second with that fussbudget Rarity today, I can't be held responsible for what I'm gonna do.
108003 Some storm, huh? The Pegasus ponies sure have outdone themselves this time. I hope you and Applejack don't have any trouble getting home.
10800d It may indeed be a problem.
108003 Well, you're welcome to stay if need be. Spike is away in Canterlot on royal business. I'm home all alone tonight. [gasp] You and Applejack should totally sleep over! We'll have a slumber party! I've always wanted one of those.
10800d Oh! Uh, goodness. Uh, I do believe I have another engagement scheduled for this evening that completely slipped my mind until just now. [nervous laugh] Ah, silly me, I can't possibly stay here all night... with Applejack. [reading] Slumber 101 - All You've Ever Wanted to Know About Slumber Parties But Were Afraid to Ask.
108003 My own personal copy. It's a fantastic reference guide. You should see the table of contents. I've been waiting for a chance to use it, and today is the day! This is gonna be so great!
10800d Yes, uh, great. [nervous laughter]
108008 [gasp] What in tarnation... Now wait just a goll-darn minute. Ya make me wash the mud off my hooves, but it's okay for y'all to have mud all over yer faces?
10800d Silly! This is called a mud mask. It's to refresh and rejuvenate your complexion.
108003 We're giving each other makeovers! Eee-hee! We have to do it, it says so in the book.
108008 Slumber 101 - Everything You... Oh hey, heh, would'ja look at the time. I gotta skidaddle on home quick. I'm powerful late for, uh, fer somethin'. Uh, g'night. [cry] Or maybe I'll sit here for a spell.
108003 Hurray slumber party!
108008 Blahch. What in the world is this for?
10800d [sigh] To reduce the puffiness around one's eyes, of course.
108008 Puffiness-schmuffiness! That's good eatin'! [chews loudly]
108003 Hee-hee! Isn't this exciting? We'll do everything by the book, and that will make my slumber party officially fun.
10800d Did you hear that, Applejack? You certainly would not want to do anything that would ruin Twilight's very first slumber party, would you?
108008 Of course not, 'n you wouldn't either, I reckon?
10800d So do we have an agreement?
108008 You betcha. [spit]
10800d Oh! Gross! You know, there's messy and there's just plain rude.
108008 You know, there's fussy, 'n there's just plain gettin' on my nerves.
10800d Fortunately, I can get along with anypony, no matter how difficult she may be.
108008 Oh yeah? Well, I'm the "get-alongin-est" pony you're ever gonna meet.
10800d That's not even a word.
108003 This is going to be the bestest slumber party ever! Yay!
108043 Yay.
10800d So, how are you getting along over there, Applejack?
108008 Just fine, Rarity.
108003 This is so awesome! [giggle] Makeovers, check. Ooh, it says here we have to tell ghost stories. Who wants to go first?
108008 Me! I'd like to tell y'all the terrifying tale of the prissy ghost who drove everypony crazy with her unnecessary neatness. Oo-oo! I'm sure y'all are familiar with that one?
10800d Never heard of it, but I have a much better one. It's the horrifying story of the messy, inconsiderate ghost who irritated everypony within a hundred miles! Oo-oo!
108008 That's not a real story. You made it up.
10800d It is a ghost story, they're all made up.
108000 [screams]
108003 I've got one! This story is called The Legend of The Headless Horse. It was a dark and stormy night, just like this one. And three ponies were having a slumber party, just like this one...
108003 ...and just when the last pony thought she was safe, there, standing right behind her, just inches away was... the Headless Horse!
108043 [gasp] [scream]
108003 Ghost story, check. Now, who wants s'mores?
10800d Then you place one marshmallow on the top of the chocolate and be sure it's centered—that's critical—and then carefully put another perfectly square graham cracker on the top. And done. Ta-da! [laugh]
108003 Ooo!
108008 Nah, ya just eat 'em. [munch] Mmm-mmm! [belch]
10800d [sigh] You could at least say "excuse me".
108008 Aw, I was just about to, but you interrupted me. Pardon.
108003 S'mores, check. Now the next item of fun we have to do is Truth or Dare.
10800d I dare Applejack to do something carefully and neatly for a change.
108008 Oh yeah? Well I dare Rarity ta lighten up and stop obsessin' over every last little detail, for a change.
10800d I think the truth of the matter is that somepony could stand to pay a little more attention to details.
108008 And I think the truth is somepony oughta quit with her fussin' so the rest of us can get things done.
108003 Um, I don't think this is how the game's supposed to work. You have to give an honest answer to any question or do whatever anypony dares you to do.
108008 I dares you to step outside and let your precious, tidy mane get ruined again.
10800d [gasps]
108003 You have to. It's the rule.
108008 Hah!
10800d Fine! [cries]
108008 [snickers] [laughs]
10800d Okay. I dare Applejack to play dress-up in a frou-frou, glittery, lacey outfit.
108008 [gasp] Happy?
10800d Very. [smirk]
108003 Um, do I ever get a turn?
108008 I dare ya to enter the next rodeo when it comes to town.
10800d I dare you not to enter the next rodeo that comes to town.
108008 I dare ya to not comb your mane a hundred times before bed.
10800d And I dare you to comb yours just once.
108003 I, uh, I think we should check off Truth or Dare and move on. Let's see what our next fun-fun-fun thing is, shall we? Hm, what does this mean? Pillow fight?
10800d Oh, please. I am not at all interested in participating in something so crude. Oh! It! Is! On! [grunt]
108003 Oh, I get it! Pillow, fight! Fun! Ugh. Ah. Uh, girls? Maybe we should take it down a notch?
108008 I will if she will.
10800d [gasp] She started it.
108003 [spit] Maybe we should just call it a night and get some sleep?
10800d Keep your muddy hooves on your side of the bed.
108008 My hooves ain't muddy.
10800d They were. There might still be a little on them.
108008 There ain't. See?
10800d Eww!
108008 Now who's bein' inconsiderate?
10800d I have to make the bed again so the blanket will be right. Get up.
108008 Hey!
10800d Ah ah ah! You'll ruin it. You have to do it like this. Mm, uh, ooh, u-u-u-uh, uh, ah.
108008 Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Geronimo!
10800d Hey!
108008 Ah.
10800d You did that on purpose.
108008 Um, yeah?
10800d Get up so I can fix it again!
108008 Can't hear ya, I'm asleep. [snore]
10800d M-mmm!
108008 I ain't budgin'.
10800d You will if you want any blanket!
108008 Give it back!
10800d I will not!
108008 Yes, you will!
10800d Won't!
108008 Will!
10800d Won't!
108008 Will!
10800d Won't!
108008 Will!
108003 Enough! It says right here that the number one thing you're supposed to do at a slumber party is have fun, and thanks to you two, I can't check that off!
108008 I've been tryin' my darndest to get along.
10800d No, it is I who have been trying my best.
108008 No, it was me.
10800d No, it was I.
108008 Me!
10800d I!
108003 I hope you're happy, both of you. You've ruined my very first slumber party. The makeover, the s'mores, Truth or Dare, the pillow fight... I mean, is there anything else that could possibly go wrong?
108000 [lightning strikes]
108003 Sorry I asked.
108044 [gasp]
108008 Ya see? That's why we needed to take down all those loose branches in town, not spiffy 'em up.
10800d But I—
108008 Outta my way, missy. Time's a-wastin'!
10800d Wait, stop! Don't!
108008 No waitin'! No stoppin'! Doin'! And that, my friends, is what we call gettin' 'er done.
10800d [cry]
108003 [cry]
108000 [crash]
10800d [cries] I tried to tell you it would come crashing down in here!
108008 Well, ya shoulda tried harder! [sigh] I'm mighty sorry, Twilight.
108003 It's... Well, it's not okay! There's a giant tree branch in the middle of my bedroom, and the book doesn't say anything about having a giant tree branch at your slumber party. Or at least I haven't found that entry yet. Ooh... [gasps]
108008 What in tarnation are y'all doin' over there?
10800d Cleaning up this mess somepony made. Who was that again? Oh, right, that's you!
108008 We gotta do somethin'!
108003 Baking... BFFs... Brothers... There's nothing in here about branches.
108008 [grunts] Rarity, for pony's sake, stop sweatin' the small stuff and help me get rid of this thing! I said hussle over here and help me! Look, I'm sorry, all right?
10800d What was that?
108008 I said I'm sorry! I shoulda listened to you when you noticed where this here branch would end up. Yer annoyin' attention to detail would'a saved us from this whole mess. But right now, ya need to stop bein' so dang fussy pickin' up all the little things and help me move the one big thing in here that actually matters! Please!
10800d Uh. Uh, but I'll get all icky.
108008 Consarnit! What the... eh... you... I mean, yes, ickiness is often a side effect of hard work. But y'all need to get over it, on account I just can't fix this mess I made myself. I need your help.
10800d Oh. Let's do this.
108003 Well, they do have a section about backyard slumber parties. Is that what we're doing right now? Does this count as camping?
10800d [grunt]
108008 [grunt]
10800d U-ugh. Oh, I look awful.
108008 Better?
10800d Hmph, thanks.
108003 Oh, pretty! Where did these come from? They're not in the book either.
108044 [laughter]
108008 Is it bigger than a barn?
108003 [laugh] Nope.
10800d Is it smaller than a saddle?
108003 [laugh] No! Only three of your twenty questions left!
108008 [sigh] We're never gonna guess what you're thinkin' of, it could be anythin'.
10800d Are we getting warmer?
108003 Why? Is it too cold in here for you? I can turn up the heat.
108008 She means are we gettin' any closer with our guesses?
108003 Oh! No. And that technically counted as a question, so only two more left!
108008 Is it... a six-legged pony with a purple polka-dotted mane and shootin' stars comin' out of his eyes?
10800d Who flies through the air all over the world to hide magic, sparkly eggs?
108003 That's it!
108043 It is?
108003 No. [chuckle] It's that. But it was just so nice to see you two finally getting along, I wanted you to be able to win together.
108043 [laughter]
108003 See? We could have been having fun like this all along.
108008 If only somepony hadn't been so persnickety.
10800d Well, maybe she wouldn't have been if somepony else hadn't been so sloppy.
108008 Sorry for being such a pain in the patootie.
10800d Oh, no, I'm sure I was much worse.
108008 That's kind of ya to say, but I'm the one who's sorry.
10800d Oh, I'm much more sorry than you are.
108008 Ugh. Are not.
10800d Are too.
108008 Are not!
10800d Are too.
108008 Are not.
10800d Are too.
108043 [laughter]
108003 I declare my first slumber party a success!
108043 [cheers]
108003 Have fun, check.
108043 [laughter]
10800d Now take two steps to your left. Uh, no, my left.
108008 Whu, which is it? [crash] Whoa! That mess is your fault, not mine. [laughter]
10800d [laughter] Sorry.
108003 Dear Princess Celestia,
108003 It's hard to believe that two ponies who seem to have so little in common could ever get along. But I found out that if you embrace each other's differences, you just might be surprised to discover a way to be friends after all.
108003 So, who's up for another slumber party tomorrow night? Ugh. How about a week from Thursday? Oh, how about two weeks from Saturday? A month from now?
108043 [laughter]
108000 [music]
108000 [credits]
109003 Wow, what a gorgeous day!
109005 Rainbow Dash must have gotten up early for once and cleared all the clouds away.
109003 I bet all of Ponyville is going to be out enjoying the sunshine. What? Where is everypony?
109005 Is it some sort of pony holiday?
109003 Not that I know of.
109005 Does my breath stink? [belch]
109003 Not more than usual.
109005 Is it... zombies?!
109003 Uh... not very likely.
109005 Not likely... but possible?
109007 Psst! Twilight! Spike! Come here! Come! Here! Hurry! Before she gets you!
109003 [groans]
109005 Who?! The zombie pony?
109007 Z-zombie pony?!
109003 Spike, there are no zombie ponies. Pinkie, what are you doing here alone in the dark?
109007 I'm not alone in the dark.
109003 [gasp] Okay then, what are you all doing here in the dark?
109008 We're hidin' from her!
109000 [ponies gasp]
109000 [theme song]
10900a Did you see her, Twilight? Did you see... Zecora?
109008 Apple Bloom! I told you never to say that name.
109003 Well, I saw her glance this way...
109007 Glance evilly this way.
109003 ... And then a bunch of you flip out for no good reason.
109008 No good reason? You call protectin' yer kin no good reason? Why, as soon as my sister saw Zecora ridin' into town, she started shakin' in her lil' horseshoes.
10900a [shakily] Did not!
109008 So I swept her up and brought her here.
10900a I walked here myself!
109008 For safe keepin'.
10900a Applejack, I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself!
109008 Not from that creepy Zecora.
10900e She's mysterious.
10900c Sinister.
109007 And spoooooky!
109003 [groans]
10901f [gasp]
109003 Will you cut that out?
10900d Just look at those stripes! So garish!
109003 She's a zebra.
10901f A what?!
109003 A zebra, and her stripes aren't a fashion choice, Rarity. They're what she was born with.
10900d [faints]
109008 Born where? I've never seen a pony like that in these parts, 'cept... her!
109003 Well, she's probably not from here, and she's not a pony. My books say that zebras come from a faraway land. But I've never seen her in Ponyville. Where does she live?
109008 That's just it, she lives in... the Everfree Forest!
109000 [crash]
109003 Spike!
109005 Uh, sorry.
109008 The Everfree Forest just ain't natural. The plants grow...
10900e Animals care for themselves...
10900c And the clouds move...
109046 All on their own!
10900d [faints]
109007 And that wicked enchantress Zecora lives there doing her evil... stuff! She's so evil I even wrote a song about her!
10900c Here we go...
109007 [Pinkie Pie]
109007 She's an evil enchantress
109007 She does evil dances
109007 And if you look deep in her eyes
109007 She'll put you in trances
109007 Then what will she do?
109007 She'll mix up an evil brew
109007 Then she'll gobble you up
109007 In a big tasty stew
109007 Soooo... Watch out!
109007 [heavy breathing]
109003 Wow. Catchy.
109007 It's a work in progress.
109003 This is all just a lot of gossip and rumors. Now tell me; what exactly have you actually seen Zecora do?
10900c Well... Once a month, she comes into Ponyville.
109003 [dramatically] Oooooh.
10900d Then, she lurks by the stores.
109003 [dramatically] Oh, my.
10900e And then, she digs at the ground.
109003 [dramatically] Good gracious! [normal tone] Okay, I'm sorry. But how is any of this bad? Maybe she comes to town to visit?
10900a Yeah! Maybe she's just tryin' to be neighborly.
109003 And maybe she's not lurking by the stores. Maybe she's going to them, lurk-free, to do some shopping?
10900a Yeah! Everypony likes to shop. You know what I think?
109008 Apple Bloom! Hush and let the big ponies talk.
10900a [under breath] I am a big pony!
10900c W-what about digging at the ground? You've got to admit that's weird.
10900e What if she's digging for innocent creatures?
109000 [Pinkie Pie sings "Evil Enchantress" in the background]
109003 I am sure there is an explanation for everything Zecora does. And if anypony here were actually brave enough to approach her, she would find out the truth.
10900a Well, I'm brave enough; I'm gonna find out myself. [gasps]
109003 You ponies are being ridiculous!
109007 Well, I heard that Zecora eats hay.
109003 Pinkie, I eat hay; you eat hay!
109007 Yeah, but I heard it's the evil way she eats hay.
109008 Hey! Where's Apple Bloom?
10900e The door's open.
10900d She went outside!
10900c And Zecora's still out there.
109008 [sigh] That silly lil' filly! I told her to stay put!
109003 Spike, you stay here in case Apple Bloom comes back.
109005 Will do!
10900a [gulps]
109008 Apple Bloom?
10900a [gasp]
109008 You get back here right now!
109047 Beware! Beware, you pony folk! Those leaves of blue are not a joke!
109008 Y-you keep your creepy mumbo-jumbo to yourself, ya hear?
109048 [shouting at Zecora]
109003 [sighs] Oh brother.
109047 Beware! Beware!
10900c Yeah, back at ya, Zecora! You and your lame curse are the ones who better beware!
109008 And you! Why couldn't you just listen to yer big sister?
10900a I...I...
109008 Who knows what kind of nasty curse Zecora could have just put on you?
109007 Just like in my song! [Starts singing a shorter version of "Evil Enchantress"]
109003 You guys, there's no such thing as curses!
10900c Well, that's interesting to hear coming from Miss Magic Pants herself.
109003 My magic, real magic, comes from within. It's a skill you're born with. Curses are artificial, fake magic. It's conjured with potions and incantations; all smoke and mirrors meant to scare. But curses have no real power, they're just an old pony tale.
109008 Just you wait, Twilight. You're gonna learn that some pony tales really are true.
109000 [dream sequence]
109007 She's an evil enchantress, she does evil dances!
109047 Beware! Beware!
109007 If you look deep in her eyes, she will put you in trances!
10900c Yeah, was that supposed to scare us?!
10900d Wicked, wicked zebra!
10900e ... it's a curse.
109007 Then what will she do?
109008 Just you wait, Twilight; some pony tales really are true.
109007 Then she'll gobble you up in a big tasty stew! Soooo... Watch out!
109047 [evil laugh]
109000 [rooster crowing]
109003 Ugh... what a dream... Curses, schmurses. Whoa! [chuckle] Maybe Zecora cursed my hair. [Laughs nervously and then gasps] Or she cursed my horn!
109003 No no no no no! None of these books have a cure! Ugh! There has to be a real reason for this! An illness? An allergy?!
109005 A curse!
109003 I said a real reason. Something that points to something real.
109005 How about this one?
109003 "Supernaturals"? Spike, the word supernatural refers to things like ghosts and spirits and zombies, which are as make-believe as curses. This book is just a bunch of hooey!
109005 But what if you're wrong, Twilight? What if this really is a—
109007 Ah pfurse!
109005 A purse? How could it be a purse?
109003 Pinkie? What happened?
109007 Pee pah Zthecora! Sthe put a cursthe on me!
109005 Hey, say it, don't spray it, Pinkie!
10900c [thud] Ow! [thud] Oh! She's [thud] trying to say—ow!—Zecora [thud]—oh!—[crash] she slapped us all with a—ow!—curse!
10900d I'm afraid I have to agree. [puffs]
109049 [yell]
109008 [high pitched voice] I hate to say I told ya so, Twilight, but I told ya so!
109049 [gasp]
109008 It's a curse, I tells ya!
109003 But Fluttershy... seems just fine!
10900d Yes, there doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with her.
109003 Fluttershy? Are you okay? Is there something wrong with you? Would you care to tell us? So... you're not going to tell us? Yes you're not, or yes you will?
109008 Good gravy, girl! What's wrong with you?!
10900e [deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
109005 [laughing] This is hilarious! Look at all of you! We got - Hairity, Rainbow Crash, Spitty Pie, Apple Teeny, Flutterguy, and... uh... I got nothin'... Twilight Sparkle. I mean seriously, I can't even work with that.
109003 [sarcastic laughter] This is no joke, Spike. Now start looking for more books so I can find a cure!
109005 [groan]
10900c [groans] I think we'll find a cure to this curse at Zecora's place!
109003 It's not a curse!
109008 I agree with Dash! We'll go to Zecora's and force her to remove this hex!
109003 It's not a hex either!
109000 [ponies arguing]
10900a This is all my fault. If I hadn't followed Zecora in the first place, none of this would have happened. I just gotta fix this.
109008 Now where does she think she's goin' this time?
10900c I don't care what you say, Twilight. It's time to pony up and confront Zecora. Come on, girls. Are you with me?
109007 Ah am-pft!
10900d And I as well.
10900e Uh, I don't know. Seems awfully dangerous.
109005 [giggle]
10900c How about you, Applejack? Applejack?
109007 Pf-she's gone-pft!
10900d Aah! Or somepony stepped on her!
109003 ... or sat on her?
10900c Rarity's hair!
10900d Oh! OH! Pinkie, what are you doing? Ah, really. Aah! You ever hear of personal space?
109007 Nopthe.
109003 Apple Bloom is gone too!
10900c I bet they went after Zecora.
109003 Well we better go find them. Come on girls, let's go.
10900d [grunt] Oh dear. Oh, this is so unseemly. Auuuaah!
10900c Hey, a little help here?
10900e Oopsie! Sorry.
10900c [crash] OW!
10900e Uh... Spike? Are you coming?
109005 Nope! Uh... gotta stay here and look for a cure. [gasp] Twilight Flopple!
109008 Stop right there! Turn around right now, missy!
10900a No.
109008 No?! You can't ignore a direct order from your big sister!
10900a Hehehe. Sorry, Applejack, but I'm the big sister now.
109008 Apple Bloom, you come back here right this instant! I'm gonna tell Big McIntosh on you! Aw, pony feathers.
109003 C'mon girls. We've got to get to Zecora's. Hurry!
10900d Ooh... Ahaha. Easier said than done.
10900c Hey, wait for me! [screaming and owing]
109008 Rainbow! Thank Celestia! There's no time to lose! I need to get to Zecora's pronto! Giddy-up pony!
10900c Ex-CUSE me?
109008 YEEE-HAW!
10900c What the...
109008 No, Rainbow Dash. Other way!
10900d Oh. I look horrible!
109007 Plis place plooks horrible!
10900d Oh my. That place really does look horrible. Nice decorations, if you like creepy!
109000 [ponies gasp]
109047 [speaking in native language]
109007 Sthe sthtole my sthong! Shthe shtole mm mm!
10900d She stole your song?
109003 Oh Pinkie. Doesn't sound anything like your song.
109007 Ah. Hmm... Pbth! [whimper]
10900e [sigh]
10900e She's an evil enchantress
10900e And she does evil dances
10900e And if you look deep in her eyes
10900e She will put you in trances
10900e Then what would she do?
10900e She'll mix up an evil brew
10900e Then she'll gobble you up
10900e In a big tasty stew
10900e Soooo... Watch out.
10900d You saw those terrible things. Now do you believe us Twilight?
109003 Scary looking masks, confusing incantations, and a great big bubbling cauldron? [sigh] Everything is pointing to Zecora being... bad. Or... what if Zecora is just making soup?
109047 Mmm! The perfect temperature for ponies, I presume. Now, where is that little Apple Bloom?
109003 Or... what if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
109003 What if she's making Apple Bloom soup?!
10904a [scream]
109008 I'm comin' for ya, Apple Bloom!
10900c Aaah!
109047 [native language]
109008 Whoa there. Easy, Rainbow Crash.
109047 Oh. [native language]
10900c [screams]
109047 [native language]
109003 What have you done with Apple Bloom?
109047 No! No! [native language]
109008 [grunt]
10900c Ahh!
109047 Ponies! What is this you...
10900c [screams]
109047 No! You know not what you do! You've gone and spilled my precious brew!
109003 We're onto you Zecora. I didn't want to believe that you cursed us, but the evidence is overwhelming!
10900d You made me look ridiculous.
10900e You made me sound ridiculous!
109007 [incoherent] You made me speak ridiculous!
109003 You ruined my horn!
109047 How dare you! You destroy my home, destroy my work, then rudely accuse me of being a jerk?
10900c You put this curse on us, now you're gonna uncurse us.
109047 It is unwise to venture down this road. Your actions will make my anger explode!
109003 Where is Apple Bloom?!
10900a Zecora! I think I found all the things ya asked for. What in Ponyville is goin' on here?
109008 [gasp] Apple Bloom! You're okay!
10900a Why wouldn't I be?
109003 Because Zecora is an evil enchantress who cursed us and was gonna cook you up into soup!
10904b [laughs]
10900a Oh Twilight. Did those silly fillies finally get in yer head? You know there's no such thing as a curse.
109003 Apple Bloom, sweetie. You can't just stand there and tell me this isn't a curse.
10900a This isn't a curse.
109047 If you will remember back, the words I spoke were quite exact. [flashback] Beware, beware you pony folk. Those leaves of blue are not a joke.
10900a It was a warnin'. About that blue plant. It's called Poison Joke.
109047 That plant is much like poison oak, but its results are like a joke.
109008 What in the hay does that mean?
109047 It means this plant does not breed wrath. Instead, this plant just wants a laugh.
109008 Will somepony please talk normal?
109003 I think what she's saying is that, when we ran in to save Apple Bloom, we ran into the poison joke. All our problems are just little jokes it played on us.
109008 Little jokes?! Very funny.
10900c Okay, fine. But what about the cauldron?
10900e And the chanting?
10900d And the creepy décor?
109047 Treasures of the native land where I am from. This one speaks 'hello', and this 'welcome'.
10900d Not welcoming at all, if you ask me.
109047 The words I chanted were from olden times. Something you call a nursery rhyme.
109003 But the cauldron... The Apple Bloom soup?
10900a Lookie here Twilight. That pot of water wasn't for me, it was for all these herbal ingredients. The cure for poison joke is a simple old-natural remedy. You just gotta take a bubble bath!
109003 But I tried to find a cure in all my books and couldn't find anything. What book has this natural remedy?
109047 Here is the book, you see? Sad that you lack it in your library.
109003 Actually, I do have this book, but I didn't look inside because the title was so... Weird. "Supernaturals - Natural Remedies and Cure-alls That Are Simply Super". I, I... I'm so sorry, Zecora. I had the answer the whole time, if only I had bothered to look inside.
109047 [chuckle] Maybe next time you will take a second look, and not judge the cover of the book.
10900a Hahaha.
109003 Zecora? Would you be kind enough to mix up another batch of the herbal bath?
109047 Mix it up I certainly will. Yet I am missing an herb from Ponyville.
10900a But whenever Zecora comes to town, all the shops are mysteriously closed.
109003 Oh, well... I think we can help you with that.
109022 Look Rose! How awful!
10902f The wicked enchantress has cursed them all.
10902e The horror, the horror!
109000 [ponies panicking]
109022 Run, ponies! Run!
109003 Daisy, we need to talk.
109003 Dear Princess Celestia,
109003 My friends and I all learned an important lesson this week - Never judge a book by its cover. Someone may look unusual, or funny, or scary. But you have to look past that and learn who they are inside. Real friends don't care what your "cover" is; it's the "contents" of a pony that count. And a good friend, like a good book, is something that will last forever.
109003 Your faithful student,
109003 Twilight Sparkle
10904c Miss Zecora, I would love to get the recipe for this bath. It's simply luxurious!
10900a Applejack! Hey, where's Applejack?!
10900f [gasp]
109008 [normal voice] I'm right here, little sis. I ain't tiny no more!
10900d Oh! I have never felt so lovely in all my life!
109007 Oh, my gosh! I never realized how horrible it is not to be able to talk. I mean, I love talking so much, and when I couldn't talk anymore, my tongue was all 'ehhhh'! It was the worst! Don't you agree, Fluttershy?
10900e [normal voice] ... Yes.
10904d [laughing]
109000 [music]
109000 [credits]
11000e La, la la, la la, la la, la la. Thank you little squirrel, but remember - these flowers are for Princess Celestia. Only the prettiest ones will do. La, la la, la la, la la, la la.
11004e [chirp]
11000e Gah!
11004e [chirp]
11000e Hello, little guy. I've never seen anything like you before.
11004e [sniff]
11000e Oh, are you hungry? Here you go. [gasp] I guess you were hungry.
11004e [purr]
11000e You're the cutest thing ever! I can't wait to show you to my friends.
110000 [theme song]
110003 Oh! Hurry up, Spike! This place isn't gonna clean itself!
110005 It also didn't mess itself up.
110003 Princess Celestia will be here tomorrow!
110005 I thought this was just an unofficial casual visit.
110003 There's nothing casual about a visit from royalty! I want this place to be spotless, and you've barely made a dent in the clutter!
110005 Maybe you should, ugh, start reading them one at a time-- whoa ho! Aw.
110003 Everything's got to be perfect. No time for fooling around.
110005 You know, this would be an awful lot easier if there weren't two of us here getting under each other's feet.
110003 Great idea! You clean, I'll go see how everyone else's preparations are coming.
110005 Or maybe I should... [groan]
110000 [ponies chatter]
110003 What happened to the rest of her name?
11003a We couldn't fit it all in.
110003 You can't hang a banner that says "Welcome Princess Celest"! Take it down and try again.
110003 That looks perfect. Keep up the good work!
110003 Hello, Mr and Mrs Cake. How's the banquet coming?
11002a Uh...it would be coming a little better if...
110007 Mmm... [slurp]
110003 Pinkie, what are you doing?! Those sweets are supposed to be for the princess!
110007 I know. That's why I'm tasting them. Somepony needs to make sure that everything is tasty enough to touch the royal tongue! And I, Pinkie Pie, declare that these treats are fit for a king. Or a queen. Or a princess!
11000e Twilight, Pinkie, you won't believe... oh, I'm sorry. Uh, am I interrupting?
110007 No, not at all. Come on in and make yourself at home. [slurp] What's going on, Fluttershy?
11000e You won't believe what I found at the edge of the Everfree Forest. Come on out, little guy. It's okay.
11004e [purr] [chirp]
11000e [gasp] Three?
110003 They're amazing. What are they?
11000e I'm not sure. I'm also not sure where these other two came from.
110003 I'll take one off your hooves. I've never seen anything so... adorable. Besides, it'll be nice to have a companion for Spike so he won't bother me so much while I'm studying.
11000e Pinkie, do you want the other one?
110007 Ugh! A parasprite? Are you kidding?
11000e Ugh?
110003 A para-what?
11000e How could you not like—
110007 Ugh. Now I gotta go find a trombone!
110003 A what?
110007 A trombone! You know - [trombone imitation]
110003 Ahhh, typical Pinkie.
11004e [purr]
11000d Stand still, Rainbow Dash!
11000c Ugh, I caaan't! I need to flyyy! This is waaay too boring for me.
11000d Do you want to look nice for Princess Celestia or not?
110003 Wow! Rarity, those outfits are gorgeous!
11000d Mm-hmm. Thank you, Twilight. Nice to know someone appreciates my talents.
11000c Ugh, sooo boooring!
11004f [chirp]
11000d Huh?
11000c What's that sound, Twilight?
11004e [several chirps]
11000c Wow, what are they?
110003 The better question is, where did they come from? I only had one a minute ago.
11000c Uh, I'll take one.
11000d Me too! Oh, they're perfect!
110007 Does anypony know where I can find an accordion?
110050 [baby talk]
110007 Girls! Hello! This is important! Durgh! Thanks a lot!
110003 [sigh] The decorations, the banquet, I really hope everything comes together in time for tomorrow.
110051 [snoring]
110003 Oh, [yawn] what's there to worry about?
11004f [snoring]
110003 Spike! Wake up! What happened?
110005 Huh? Whaaa! What's going on?
11004e [chirp]
110003 Where did they come from?
110005 I don't know. The little guy got hungry in the night, so I gave him a snack, but... I have no idea where these others came from. Oh no! They're messing up all my hard work!
110003 The princess will be here in a few hours.
110005 Ugh.
110003 Spike, help me round up these little guys.
110005 Ugh, what does it look like I'm doin'? Ooow, waaah! D'oh. I know, I know, "stop fooling around".
11004e [several chirps]
11000c Huh? Huh?! [screams] [grunting] Get off me! [grunting] Waaa!
11000d Not only are you adorable, but you're also quite useful.
11004e [purr] [grunt]
11000d Oh! Are you okay? Aaah! [gasp] Eewww. Aaah! Gross, gross, gross! No creature that behaves so revoltingly is allowed in my boutique!
11004e [grunt] [pop]
11000d [screams]
110007 Look, Rarity! Applejack loaned me a harmonica! [plays harmonica] Isn't that great?
11004f [chirping]
110007 [gasp] And not a moment too soon!
11000d Ugh, Pinkie, I'm a little busy right now.
110007 And I'm not? You know how many more instruments I've gotta find? A lot, that's how many! Now if we split the list between us, we might just make it in time.
11000d Please, Pinkie, I don't have time for some silly scavenger hunt. I've got a real problem.
110007 You've got a real problem, all right. And a banjo is the only answer!
110003 [gasp]
11000d [gasp] I see we're having the same problem.
11000c Ditto!
110003 Fluttershy knows everything about animals, I'm sure she can tell us how to stop them from multiplying.
11004f [chirp]
110003 ...or not.
110003 Ugh, do something, Fluttershy! Can't you control them?
11000e I've tried everything I know. I've tried begging, and pleading, and beseeching, and asking politely, and...
11000c Guh... [moans]
110019 [scream]
110003 If we can't get them under control before the princess arrives, it'll be a total disaster!
11004e [hack]
11000d Ew! If you ask me, it's already a total disaster!
110008 Here's all those apples you wanted, Fluttershy, but I still can't figure why y'need so many. Hey!
11000e What do we do?
110003 [gasp] I got it! Nopony can herd like Applejack!
11000c Yeah! We can drive 'em back into the forest!
110008 [scoffs] I'll rastle 'em up, but I need everypony's help to do it. Twilight, you and Rarity wait over there. I'll herd the little critters straight at ya like a funnel. Rainbow Dash, you and Fluttershy stay on top of 'em, don't let 'em fly away.
11000c Aye-aye!
110008 Yeeeeeee-haw!
11004e [screech]
110008 Alright, y'all, here goes nothin'! Look out, Rarity, that one's fixin' to get away! Keep a lead on 'em, Rainbow Dash! Hold on, girls, we're almost there!
110003 Pinkie!
110007 Twilight, we don't have much time!
110003 You're telling me! The princess could arrive at any moment!
110007 Exactly! That's why I need you gals to drop what you're doing and help me find some maracas!
110003 Maracas? Pinkie, we've got much bigger problems than missing maracas!
110007 [gasp] You're right! Getting a tuba has to be our number-one goal! Follow me! I said, follow me!
11000c Pinkie Pie, you are so random.
110007 And you are all so stubborn!
110008 Forget her, ladies. Focus! Head 'em up and move 'em out!
11000c All right! [grunt]
11000e Ouch.
110003 We did it! Nice work, Applejack!
110008 Couldn't a'done it without y'all.
110003 Now let's get back and clean up the mess they made before the princess arrives.
110003 Okay, everyone knows what to do, right? We gotta work extra hard to make up for lost time.
11000e [gasps]
110003 Where did they come from?!
11000e Well, I may have kept just one. Heh. I couldn't help myself. They're just so cute.
110003 We don't have time to keep rounding up these things! What do we do now?
11000c We call in the weather patrol! [grunts]
11000d [yelp]
11000c Time to take out the adorable trash. [yell]
11004f [chirp]
110003 [grunt] Way to go, Rainbow Dash!
110008 Looks like our problems are solved!
110007 They will be with these cymbals!
110000 [cymbals crashing]
110007 Hey! Give me those back!
11000c Whoa. Yah! Yow! Whoa! Wow! I can't hold it! She's breaking up!
110003 Pinkie Pie, what have you done?!
110007 I've lost a brand-new pair of cymbals, that's what I've done!
110003 Will you forget about your silly instruments for one second?! You're ruining our efforts to save Ponyville!
110007 Me?! Ruin?! I'm not the ruiner, I'm the ruin-ee! Or is it ruiness? Ruinette?
110008 Come on, girls, there's no reasoning with that one. She's a few apples short of a bushel.
110007 Hey! I'm trying to tell you all that the ruining is on the other hoof, if you'd just slow down and listen to me!
11004f [chirps] [munch] [munch]
110034 [gasp]
110052 Aah!
11000e What do we do? They're eating all the food in town!
110008 [gasp] My apples!
110003 We've gotta do something! [gasps] I got it! I'll cast a spell to make them stop eating all the food!
110007 Look, tambourines! If you could all just... [scream] [tambourines shake]
110003 [gasp]
11004e [chirp]
110003 [sigh]
11004e [munch]
11000c Heh. Hey, it worked. They're not eating the food anymore.
11000d Oh, no. If they get inside my store... Everypony for herself!
11000d My outfits! Go on, shoo! Get out of here, you naughty! Naughty! [shrieks]
110007 I'll save you!
110000 [recorder]
11000d [scream]
110008 No woodland creature's gonna eat the Apple Family's crop!
110000 [parasprites buzzing]
110008 Brace yourself, y'all! Here they come!
110000 [crash]
110008 [gasp] Didn't see that one comin'.
110005 Help!
110003 [gasp] They're eating the words! [grunts]
110005 Help...
110000 [crash]
110047 Ugh. Have you gone mad?!
110003 Zecora, these little guys are devouring Ponyville, and the princess is on her way! Can you help us? Please?
110047 Oh monster of so little size, is that a parasprite before my eyes?
110003 I don't know! Is it?!
110047 Tales of crops and harvests consumed. If these creatures are in Ponyville, you're doomed.
110003 [gulp]
110003 [grunts] Oh, no! Here she comes.
110000 [ponies scream]
110022 Aaaah, aaaaaaah!
110003 Okay, here's the plan. Rainbow Dash, you distract them.
11000c YAAAA!
110003 Good! Everyone else, we need to build an exact copy of Ponyville right over there. We've got less than a minute! Zecora was right, we're doomed. Oh no, the princess's procession is here! It's all over!
110000 [polka music]
110003 Pinkie, we're in the middle of a crisis here! This is no time for your... nonsense?
110003 Look!
110019 Twilight Sparkle, my prized pupil!
110003 Hello, Princess!
110019 So lovely to see you again, as well as your friends.
110000 [crash]
110003 So... how was the trip? Hit much traffic?
110019 Ah, what is this? Oh ho ho, these creatures are adorable!
11000c They're not that adorable.
110019 I'm terribly honored that you and the good citizens of Ponyville have organized a parade in honor of my visit.
110003 Parade? Oh, yes! The parade!
110019 Unfortunately, that visit is going to have to wait for another time. I'm afraid an emergency has come up in Fillydelphia. Apparently there's been some sort of infestation.
110003 An... infestation?
110019 Yes, a swarm of incredibly bothersome creatures has invaded the poor town. I'm sorry, Twilight, to have to put you all through so much trouble.
110003 Trouble? What trouble?
110019 Before I have to go, would you care to give me your latest report on the magic of friendship in person?
110003 My... report?
110019 Haven't you learned anything about friendship?
110003 Actually, I have. I've learned that sometimes the solution to your problems can come from where you least expect it. It's a good idea to stop and listen to your friends' opinions and perspectives...
110000 [cymbals crash]
110003 Even when they don't always seem to make sense.
110019 I'm so proud of you, Twilight Sparkle, and I'm very impressed with your friends as well. It sounds like you're all learning so much from each other.
110003 Thank you, Princess.
110007 Hey, what happened to the princess?
110003 Emergency in Fillydelphia.
11000c Some sort of infestation.
110007 Oh, no! Have they got parasprites too? Well, have tuba, will travel.
110003 I think the princess can handle it.
110008 So you knew what those critters were all along, huh, Pinkie Pie?
110007 Well, duh! Why do you think I was so frantic to get my hooves on all these instruments? I tried to tell you.
110003 We know, Pinkie Pie, and we're sorry we didn't listen.
110053 [apologies]
110003 You're a great friend, even if we don't always understand you.
110007 Thanks, guys. You're all great friends too, even when I don't understand me.
110003 You saved my reputation with Princess Celestia, and more importantly, you saved Ponyville!
110003 ...Or not.

111003 [gasp] Spike, wake up. Wake up, wake up, it's Winter Wrap Up day!
111005 Huh? Mommy?
111003 Winter Wrap Up!
111005 You're not mommy.
111003 Spike, the first day of spring is tomorrow, so everypony in Ponyville needs to clean up winter. Now help me get ready.
111005 Clean up winter? Who cleans up winter? Don't they just use magic to change the seasons like they do in Canterlot?
111003 No Spike, Ponyville was started by Earth ponies, so for hundreds of years they've never used magic to clean up winter. It's traditional. [sigh]
111005 It's ridiculous. No magic... Fuh.
111003 Okay, let's see - scarf, check; saddle, check; boots, check; Spike refusing to get up and going back to sleep, check. It's a good thing I'm so organized, I'm ready. Bright and early. Oh... maybe a little too early.
111000 [theme song]
111003 Those must be the team vests Rarity designed. Blue for the weather team, green for the plant team, and tan for the animal team. I wonder which team vest I'll be wearing.
111005 I'll take a blue vest, same color as my blankie, which I think I hear calling my name. "Spike! Spike! Come to bed!" Ugh, it's too early.
111010 Thank you, everypony, for being here bright and early. We need every single pony's help to wrap up winter, and bring in spring.
111000 [ponies cheering]
111010 Now, all of you have your vests, and have been assigned to your teams, so let's do even better than last year, and have the quickest Winter Wrap Up ever!
111000 [ponies cheering]
111003 Oh, this is so exciting.
111010 All right, everypony, find your team leader, and let's get galloping!
111003 Oh gosh, where should I go? I'm not sure where I fit in. What exactly does everypony do?
11100c [Rainbow Dash]
11100c Three months of winter coolness
11100c And awesome holidays
111007 [Pinkie Pie]
111007 We've kept our hoofsies warm at home
111007 Time off from work to play
111008 [Applejack]
111008 But the food we've stored is runnin' out
111008 And we can't grow in this cold
11100d [Rarity]
11100d And even though I love my boots
11100d This fashion's getting old
111003 [Twilight Sparkle]
111003 The time has come to welcome spring
111003 And all things warm and green
111003 But it's also time to say goodbye
111003 It's winter we must clean
111003 How can I help? I'm new, you see
111003 What does everypony do?
111003 How do I fit in without magic?
111003 I haven't got a clue!

11100c All right team, you're clear for takeoff.
111003 Rainbow Dash!
11100c Oh, hey Twilight, what's up?
111003 What are you doing?
11100c Sending off one of my flight crews to retrieve the birds that have flown south for the winter.
111003 Oh, can I help? How about if I help clear out the clouds?
11100c Um...
111003 Right. No wings.
11100c Sorry, Twilight.
111003 [gasp] Great, now what do we do?
111005 I don't know about you, but I'm gonna be nappin'. [snore]
111003 Come on Spike, this is serious business. Winter needs to be wrapped up, and I'm determined to do my part. Somehow.
111003 Rarity, please tell me there's something, anything I can help you with.
11100d Well, how would you like to help create Ponyville's finest birds' nests?
111003 Birds' nests?
11100d Why yes. When the weather team guides the birds back north for the spring, they'll need a place to live and lay their eggs.
111003 Wow, Rarity, that one's really beautiful.
11100d Oh why, thank you most sincerely. Would you like to try your hoof at a nest?
111003 Would I? Yes! Where do I begin?
11100d Okay. Now... uh, take some of that straw and hay over there, and a little bit of branch. Now, weave them through there, yes. Uh, take some ribbon, yes, oh uh, n-not there, oooh, yes, uh, tuck it in over there, uh but be careful not to... oh, no, no, I-I guess that will do... oh dear.
111003 There! It looks just like... yours. Oh my.
111005 That nest needs to be condemned.
11100d Oh, Spa-ha-hike, it's not so bad, ah, maybe birds can use it as a...
111005 An outhouse?
11100d Spike. It's just fine. It's just a little rough around the edges. Let me lend you a hoof. Let's just untie this ribbon, and if we take out these sticks here, and we shape this... [mumbling]
111003 Hw...
111005 I think we lost her.
11100d Ah, and we need to weave the string...
111007 Hellooooooo, Twilight! Wheeeeeeee!
111003 Wow, Pinkie Pie, you're quite the skater. Probably the best skater I've ever seen.
111007 Thanks Twilight, I've been doing this since I was an itty-bitty little-wittle Twinkie-Pinkie. Just comes naturally. Which is probably why they designated me the lake scorer. I cut lines in the lake with my skates. That way, when the rest of the weather team comes here to break the ice, it'll be easy as pie.
111003 How clever. When the thick ice begins to melt, it'll break along the lines. Well, you sure have a lot of work ahead of you; there's quite a few lakes in Ponyville.
111007 Ha, tell me about it. Hey, Twilight, wanna help me out?
111003 Would I?
111007 Come on, put on those skates over there. I bet you'll be a natural too.
111003 Okay.
111007 Yaaaaay! [cheers]
111003 Uh... maybe on second thought.
111005 What are you talking about? You said you wanted to be helpful.
111007 Yippie!
111005 Now get out there.
111003 Whoa, whoa, wow...
111007 Twilight, steer! Steer!
111003 Yaaaaa!
111007 Oh boy!
111054 [scream]
111005 [yelp] Pwuh.
111007 [lip trill]
111005 Ha ha, you are a natural, Twilight. A natural disaster. [laughter]
111007 Twilight, you did a great job your first time around. I'm sure my first time was just as wobbly and bobbly and crasheriffic as yours.
111003 Really?
111007 No.
111005 [chuckles]
111007 But did I make you feel better?
111003 Ehe, yeah, I guess.
111007 I think you'll be super awesome at something that keeps your hooves on the ground. I know, Fluttershy could probably use your help with the critters.
111003 Well... I'm pretty good with little animals. Yeah, I'll go help her.
111007 Uh... it's, ah, that a-way.
111003 Yaaaaaa!
111005 [chuckles]
11100e Wake up, little sleepy heads. Hope you had some wonderful dreams and restful hibernation, but it's time to get up now, spring is coming.
111055 [yawn]
111003 Awww, how cute.
11100e Aren't they? This is my favorite task the whole season, when I get to see all my little animal friends again.
111005 Uh, what's "hibernation"?
11100e It's like a long sleep.
111005 Long sleep?
11100e Yes. [bell rings] Wake up, little porcupines. Animals often hibernate through the winter to save their energy and eat less food.
111005 I definitely like the idea of hibernation, uh, except for the "eat less food" part.
111056 [yawn] [yelp]
11100e Oh, would you just look at all these warrens and dens? I'm worried that I won't be able to wake up every animal before spring comes.
111003 Well, I'll help, Fluttershy.
11100e You will? Oh, that would be wonderful.
111003 Okay, let's start there.
111000 [bell ringing]
111003 Hello? Wake up little friends, wherever you are. Spring is coming. [bell rings] I wonder which cute little furry creatures I've awoken.
111057 [hiss]
111003 Waaa! Snakes! Snakes! [scream] Ugh! [grunt] [scream] Ugh!
11100e Good morning, friends.
111003 [groan]
111003 [sigh] All this Winter Wrap Up stuff is a lot harder than it looks.
111005 [nasally] Right, because there's no magic. Why don't you just use magic, Twilight, and get it done the right way?
111003 No, Spike, I have to do it the traditional way. Ponyville has never needed magic to wrap up winter.
111005 [nasally] Well, they never had you here before, either. Think how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
111003 No, no, no! I'm gonna find some other way that I can help out if it kills me! [grunt]
111008 Keep pushin', Caramel. That's it, Bumpkin. I know it's hard work, but you guys are doin' great. Yee-haw!
111003 Hey, Applejack. How's everything going?
111008 Oh, just dandy. A little slow startin', but peachy all the same. There's a lot of ground to clear, ya hear? We can't even start the plantin' and the waterin' until we git all these heap a' snow hightailed outta here.
111003 Well, I'd like to help.
111008 Well, I... I dunno Twilight.
111003 Just give me a chance.
111008 Well, I never turn down a hard worker, but...
111003 [struggle] Ugh... [struggle] Ugh... [gasp]
111005 Think of how much quicker they could wrap up winter with your magic.
111003 I could use a come-to-life spell. Hwww... Here goes...
111008 Hmm. She's awful strong for such a little pony.
111005 That's my girl, following my advice!
111008 And what in tarnation does that mean?
111003 [gasp] Uh-oh. Slow down. Slow down!
111005 [yelp]
111058 Whoa-oa-oa!
111008 What's going on? Wha'd'ya do? You used magic, didn't you?
111000 [crash]
111000 [rumbling]
111008 Nuts, Twilight! You used magic!
111005 The nerve! Can you believe her?
111008 That's not how we do it around here, Twilight, and especially not on my farm!
111003 Well, see, I just wanted to... [whine]
111005 Come on, Twilight. Come on out.
111003 I'm a winter mess up.
111005 Well you're good at a lot of things, just not nest-making, ice-skating, animal-waking, snow-clearing.
111003 [whine] Thanks a lot for making me feel so much better.
111005 That's what I'm here for, sister.
111008 Rainbow Dash, y'all on the weather team need to melt the rest of the snow here on the ground and the trees, pronto.
11100c Got it.
11100e You can't. My poor little animals' homes will get flooded if the snow melts too fast.
11100c Got it.
111008 I'm tellin' you, Rainbow, you gotta melt that snow now.
11100e No, you simply must wait.
11100c Okay.
111008 Go.
11100e Stop.
111008 Go.
11100e Stop.
111008 GO!
11100e STOP!
11100c Ugh! Make up your minds!
111010 Oh! What in Equestria are all you arguing about? This sort of silliness is why we were late for spring last year, and the year before that, and the year before that.
111003 Did she say late?
111010 I was hoping my amazingly inspirational speech would urge everyone to do better than last year, but now it looks like we're going to be later than ever. I mean just look at this catastrophe! The ice scorers made the ice chunks too big to melt. The nest designer is horrendously behind. We need several hundred, and she's only made one!
11100d [sob]
111010 And don't get me started on all the clouds in the sky, the icicles on the trees... this isn't good, not at all!
111008 And it's gonna be all to pieces disastrous if we can't get our seeds all planted.
11100c Chillax Applejack, we're bustin' our chops as fast as we can.
11100e No, not fast. We have to wake animals slowly.
111026 Uh, AJ?
111008 Oh good gravy, Caramel lost the grass seeds again, didn't he?
111026 Eeyup.
111059 [whimpers]
11105a [grunt] Ditzy Doo accidentally went north to get the southern birds!
11100c Oh, that featherbrain. Didn't she learn her lesson last year when she went west?
111000 [ponies complaining]
111010 Stop this at once. We don't have time to argue. It's almost sundown. Spring is going to be late again. Another year of scandal and shame. If only we could be more organized.
111003 Spike! Get my checklist and clipboard, STAT!
111005 Eh, yes, ma'am.
111003 Stop, everypony!
111000 [ponies arguing]
111003 Stop!
111000 [elongated bird chirp]
111003 Sorry. I know you all want to complete your jobs on time, but arguing is no way to go about it. What you need is organization, and I'm just the pony for the job.
111000 [Winter Wrap Up instrumental]
111010 I can't believe it. Spring is here, on time! And we have you to thank for it. If it weren't for your organizing skills, we would still be arguing.
111026 Eeyup.
111000 [ponies laughing]
111003 It was a team effort.
111010 And since you helped every team, we have an official vest for you. We give you the title "All-Team Organizer".
111003 Gosh, I don't even know what to say. Thank you, everypony!
111010 And hereby I declare that winter is... wrapped up on time!
111000 [ponies cheering]
111008 Spike's sure gonna be in for a hog-sized surprise when that last piece a' ice melts.
111000 [ponies laughing]
111003 Dear Princess Celestia,
111003 Winter Wrap Up was one of the most special things I've ever been a part of here in Ponyville. It helped me to learn we all have hidden talents, and if we're patient and diligent, we're sure to find them. And as always, with good friendship and teamwork, ponies can accomplish anything. How's that, Spike? Spike?
111005 [snoring]
111003 Oh, Spike. [laughs]
111000 [music]

112000 [school bell ringing]
112000 [chatter]
11205b Let's quiet down, please. We have a very important lesson to get to. [class quiets down] Thank you. Today we are going to be talking about cutie marks.
11205c Bo-ring. [sigh]
11205b You can all see my cutie mark, can't you? Like all ponies, I wasn't born with a cutie mark. My flank was blank.
11205d Aww...! She's so precious!
11205b Then one day, when I was about your age, I woke up to find that a cutie mark had appeared.
112000 [offscreen: Look at her hair!]
11205b Yes, I know, but honestly, that's how everypony was wearing their mane back then. I had decided to become a teacher, and the flowers symbolized my hope that I could help my future students bloom if I nurture them with knowledge. The smiles represented the cheer I hope to bring to my little ponies while they were learning. Now, can anyone tell me when a pony gets his or her cutie mark?
11205d Oh! Oh! Oh! When she discovers that certain something that makes her special!
11205b That's right, Twist. A cutie mark appears on a pony's flank when he or she finds that certain something that makes them different from every other pony. Discovering what makes you unique isn't something...
11205c (Pssst!)
11205e that happens overnight, and no amount of hoping, wishing...
11205c (Pssst!)
11205e or begging will make a cutie mark appear before its time.
11205c Pssst!
11200a What?!
11205b Apple Bloom! Are you passing a note?
11200a Uh, I... Um...
11205b What could be so important that it couldn't wait until after class? [gasp] It's blank.
11205c [laughter] Remind you of anypony? [laughter]
112000 [students whispering]
112000 [theme song]
112000 [school bell ringing]
112000 [chatter]
11205d Want some sweets? I've got some peppermint sticks. I made them myself.
11200a Mm-mm.
11205d They'll make you smi-i-le.
11200a No...
11205c I don't know why we had to sit through a lecture about getting a cutie mark. I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is sooo last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already. [gasp] I mean, almost all of us have them already. Don't worry, you two, you're still totally invited to my cute-ceañera this weekend.
11205f It's going to be amazing.
11205c It's a party celebrating me and my fantastic cutie mark. How could it not be?
112060 Bump, bump, sugar lump rump! [laughing]
11200a Gimme a break.
11205f See you this weekend...
112060 [laughing] Blank flanks! [laughing]
11200a It's not fair! It's just not fair!
112008 Don't get your mane in a tangle. You'll get your cutie mark. Everypony gets one eventually.
11200a But I don't want one eventually! I want one right now! I can't go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera without one! I just can't!
112008 'Course you can! Y'know, I was the last pony in my class to get my cutie mark, and I couldn't be prouder of it. I knew my future was to run Sweet Apple Acres, and these bright shiny apples sealed the deal. [gasp] Come to think of it, Granny Smith was the last one in her class, too. Huh, same as Big McIntosh.
11200a I really don't see how that's supposed to make me feel better. It probably means that being the last one in your class to get a cutie mark runs in the family. ...runs in the family. Runs in the family! Runs in the family! You've got apples for your cutie mark, Granny Smith has an apple pie, Big McIntosh has an apple half, my unique talent must has som'n to do with apples! Apples, apples, apples! [crash] Oops... apples.
112008 Get your delicious, nutritious apples here!
11200a Delicious and nutritious, and so many uses! [chomp] You can eat 'em. [gulp] Play with 'em. [grunt]
112000 [offscreen: Hey, watch it!]
11200a Create fine art for your home with 'em. You have to be crazy not to get a bushel of your very own.
112008 Heh... she's so creative, heh.
11200a You, sir, care t' buy some apples?
112061 No thanks.
11200a Why not?
112061 I have plenty at home.
11200a Are you sure?
112061 Yes, I'm pretty sure I...
11200a You're pretty sure, but you're not absolutely positively completely super-duper sure, are you?
112061 Y...ah... If I buy some apples, will you please leave me alone?
11200a All right!
112008 You forgot your change!
11200a Woo-hoo! That's how you sell s'm apples and get a cutie mark! So, what does my cutie mark look like? A shoppin' bag full of apples? A satisfied customer eating an apple? Hmm... maybe I gotta increase my sales figures first. You touch it, you buy it! We take cash or credit.
112008 I'm sorry, ma'am. Ma'am! Aww... Now Apple Bloom, you can't just—
11200a That'll be four bits.
112027 I didn't put those in my bag!
11200a Likely story. Four bits, lady!
112008 Apple Bloom! I am really really sorry about that. She's new. Here, take these. No charge. And these. And these.
112027 [groan]
112008 Y'all come back now, y'hear?
11200a What?
112008 Sorry, little sis, but your apple-sellin' days are over.
11200a What?! But how else am I gonna get my cutie mark?
112008 Home! Now!
11200a Hmph!
112008 [sighs] Listen, sugarcube, I know it's hard to wait for your very own cutie mark, but you just can't force it. Besides, you're not that grown-up just yet. Ain't there other fillies in your class without one?
11200a Well... Twist doesn't have hers yet.
112008 Do you think you'd feel better if you went to the party with her?
11200a Mmm-hmm.
112008 Well, there you go! Bet you and Twist would have a great time together. Now run along and find your friend.
11200a You're sure you don't want me to stick around 'til the end of th' market?
112062 Hey! Who's been usin' my racket?!
112008 Yeah. I'm sure.
112000 [knocking]
11205d Oh, what's up, Apple Bloom?
11200a So I was thinkin'... maybe we could go to Diamond Tiara's cute-ceañera together. I don't have a cutie mark, you don't have a cutie mark.
11205d Well, um...
11200a [gasp]
11205d Isn't my cutie mark swell? I've always loved making my own favorite sweets, but it took me some time to discover that it was my super-special talent. Pretty sweet, huh?
11200a Yeah, pretty... sweet.
11205d Hey... this doesn't mean we can't go to the cute-ceañera together. You're still gonna come to the party, are you?
11205c Of course she will.
11205f It's not like being the only pony there without a cutie mark would be, like, the most embarrassing thing ever. [laughter]
11200c Whoa, looks like somepony's got a dark cloud hanging over her head. Let me do something about that. What's the matter, kid?
11200a [inhales] There's a cute-ceañera this afternoon and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I wanna get my cutie mark but I'm no good at sellin' apples but I really wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark which my big sister says I'm gonna get eventually but... I WANT IT NOW!
11200c Cutie mark? I can get you a cutie mark like that! [snap]
11200a Applejack says these things take time. I have to just wait for it to happen.
11200c Why wait for something to happen when you can make it happen?
11200a But... Applejack says th—
11200c Hey, who are you gonna listen to? Applejack, or the pony who was first in her class to get a cutie mark? I always liked flying an' all, but I was going nowhere in a hurry. It wasn't until my very first race that I discovered a serious need for speed. And KAZAM! this sweet baby appeared as fast as lightning.
11200c That's right, stretch out those legs! Gotta be nice and loose! The key here is to try as many things as possible as quickly as possible. One of them is bound to lead to your cutie mark. Are you ready?
11200a I'm ready!
11200c I said, are you ready?!
11200a I'm ready!
11200c Juggling, go! [whistle blows]
11200a Ah!
11200c Hang-gliding, go! [whistle blows]
11200a Whoa!
11200c Karate, go! [whistle blows]
11200a Hi-ya! Ee...
11200c Kite-flying, go! [whistle blows]
11200c Ultrapony Roller Derby, go! [whistle blows]
112063 [growl]
11200a Whoaaa! Whoa...
11200c Tried that one... tried that one... tried that one...
11205f Your new outfit is, like, perfect for the party.
11205c I know. It totally shows off my cutie mark.
11205f I love being special.
11205c Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be... not special?
11205f I don't even want to, like, think about it.
11200c Tried that one... Huh, tried that one...
11200a I'm doomed. Doomed! I'll never find somethin' I'm good at!
112007 You look like you'd be good at eating cupcakes.
11200a Eatin' cupcakes?
11200c Eating cupcakes?
112007 Eating cupcaaakes!
11200a I really appreciate all your help, Rainbow Dash. You're a really great coach and I really learned a lot from you and I'm sure I can learn a lot more but... I've got some cupcakes to eat! See you at the cute-ceañera! Hold on, Pinkie Pie, I'm comin'.
11200a I can't believe I didn't think of this. A cupcake-eating cutie mark! It's sooo obvious! Now, where are those cupcakes? I'm ready t' chow down!
112007 I don't have any cupcakes.
11200a Oh.
112007 [gasp] But you look like you'd be good at helping me make some!
11200a I guess a "making-cupcakes" cutie mark could work too.
112007 [Pinkie Pie]
112007 All you have to do is take a cup of flour
112007 Add it to the mix
112007 Now just take a little something sweet, not sour
112007 A bit of salt, just a pinch
112007 Baking these treats is such a cinch
112007 Add a teaspoon of vanilla
112007 Add a little more, and you count to four,
112007 And you never get your fill of...
112007 Cupcakes! So sweet and tasty
112007 Cupcakes! Don't be too hasty
112007 Cupcakes! Cupcakes, cupcakes, CUPCAKES!
11200a [cough] Hot, hot, hot!
112007 Ooh, those look much better than the last batch! [chomp] Mmm...
11200a Ugh! I guess I'm not cut out to be a baker either. [sigh] I just have to face it, I'm gonna have a blank flank forever.
112007 What about that?
11200a What about what? Is there something on my flank? Is there, is there, is there? [gasp] A cutie mark! It's a... a measuring cup? No. A mixin' bowl? No... Are those cupcakes? A tower of cupcakes maybe.
112007 [blow] Flour! I-it's flour! Yay, I guessed it! What game you wanna play next? Please say bingo, please say bingo.
112003 Whoa, what's been going on in here?
112007 We've been making cupcakes, wanna try them?
112003 Nnno, thank you... not that they don't look, heh, delicious.
11200a Twilight, you have to help me!
112003 What's the matter?
11200a [inhales] Tiara's cute-ceañera's today and everypony in my class will be there and they'll all have their cutie marks and I want to get my cutie mark but I'm no good at selling apples or hang-gliding or making cupcakes, but I wanna go to the party but how can I go to the party if I don't have my cutie mark, which Pinkie Pie says I can't just make appear, but I need it to appear [inhales] right now!
112003 Uh... I don't follow. How can I help you?
11200a You can use your magic to make my cutie mark appear!
112003 Oh, no, Apple Bloom. A cutie mark is something a pony has to discover for herself.
11200a Please, Twilight. Just try.
112003 I'm sorry, but—
11200a Oh, please, please, please please please!
112003 All right, all right!
11200a Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Yes! I knew you could do... it.
112003 I'm sorry, sweetie, but I told you—
11200a Try again, try again!
112003 [sigh]
112000 [magic twangs]
11200a [gasp]
112003 Told you that not even magic can make a cutie mark appear before its time.
11200a It's hopeless. Hopeless! I just won't go to the party. I can't go! Everyone will just laugh at me and make fun of me and call me names! It will be the worst night of my life!
112003 I'm sure it won't be as bad as all that.
11200a Forget it, there's no way I'm going to that... [gulp] party.
112000 [ponies chatter]
11200a How could I have forgotten the time? How could I have forgotten Pinkie Pie was hosting the party? How could I have forgotten it was at Sugarcube Corner?
112007 Don't forget your party hat, Forgetty Forgetterson!
11200a I have to get out of here before anypony sees me.
112035 [chomp]
11205c Hey! It's my cute-ceañera. I'm supposed to get the first bite at cake!
112000 [balloons popping]
11200a Okay, Apple Bloom, almost there.
112064 [slurps]
112008 Apple Bloom, you made it. After I heard about Twist, I was afraid you wouldn't show up. I sure am glad you came to your senses about this whole cutie mark thing. These things happen when these things are supposed to happen. Trying to rush 'em just drives you crazy. I'll let you be, looks like your friends want to talk to you.
11200a [grunt]
11205c Well, well, well. Look who's here.
11205f Nice outfit.
11200a Just sumt'n I, uh, pulled together last minute.
11205c It really shows off your cutie mark. Oh wait, that's right. You don't have one.
11200a Uh, I have a cutie mark.
11205f Eh, what? Since when?
11200a Since... um... earlier today.
11205c Oh, really? Let's see it.
11200a I shouldn't. I-I couldn't. My cutie mark is so unbelievably amazing, I'm afraid that if I show it off, everyone will start paying attention to me instead of you. Outshined at your own cute-ceañera. Can you imagine how embarrassing that would be?
11205c Uh, forget it, I didn't really want to see it anyway.
11200a Okay, well, I'm gonna go mingle. Enjoy your party! [sigh]
112000 [record scratch]
112000 [gasps]
11200a Oh no.
11205f Wow, that is an amazing cutie mark.
11205c Nice try...
112060 Blank flank!
112000 [ponies murmuring]
112065 [offscreen] You got a problem with blank flanks?
112000 [fillies gasp]
112065 I said, you got a problem with blank flanks?
11205f The problem is, I mean, she's like, totally not special.
112066 No, it means she's full of potential.
112065 It means she could be great at anything. The possibilities are, [mocking] like, endless.
112066 She could be a great scientist, or an amazing artist, or a famous writer. She could even be mayor of Ponyville someday.
112065 And she's not stuck being stuck-up like you two.
112000 [laughter]
11205c Hey! This is my party. Why are you two on her side?
112065 Because...
11200a [gasp] You don't have your cutie marks either? I thought I was the only one!
112065 We thought we were the only two.
112003 I, for one, think you are three very lucky fillies.
11205c Lucky? How can they be lucky?
112003 They still get to experience the thrill of discovering who they are, and what they're meant to be.
112008 And they got all the time in the world to figure it out, not just an afternoon.
112000 [chatter]
112067 Wow, Apple Bloom! I wish I could be a scientist!
112068 Do you really think you could be mayor?
112069 Maybe I got my cutie mark too soon.
11205c Hey, what's everypony doing? This is my party! Everypony is supposed to be paying attention to me!
11205f Whatever. We still think you're losers, right, Diamond Tiara? Bump, bump, sugar lump—
11205c Not now, Silver Spoon.
112065 Name's Scootaloo.
112066 And I'm Sweetie Belle.
11200a Apple Bloom.
112000 [music]
11205d This song is so super!
11200a So I was thinking, now that we're friends... I mean, we are friends, right?
112065 How could we not be? We're totally alike. We don't have cutie marks, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon drive us crazy—
112066 Totally crazy!
11200a Well, now that we're friends, what if the three of us work together to find out who we are and what we're supposed to be?
112066 Ooh! Ooh! We could form our own secret society!
112065 I'm liking this idea.
11200a A secret society. Yeah. We need a name for it though.
112065 The Cutie Mark Three?
112066 The Cutastically Fantastics?
11200a How about... The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
112065 It's perfect!
112066 This is gonna be so great!
11200a We're gonna be unstoppable!
112065 What do you say we celebrate with some of these delicious cupcakes?
11200a Not the cupcakes! Trust me.
112066 Let's see if there are any cookies!
11200a Yeah!
112065 Come on!
112003 Dearest Princess Celestia,
112003 I am happy to report that one of your youngest subjects has learned a valuable lesson about friendship. Sometimes, the thing you think will cause you to lose friends and feel left out...
112019 ...can actually be the thing that helps you make your closest friends and realize how special you are. Hmm...
112000 [music]
112000 [credits]
11300c [grunt] Whoo-hoo!
113008 Hoo-wee! Not a bad pitch for a pony who works with her head in the clouds.
11300c Oh yeah? Think you can do better, cowgirl?
113008 I know I can. [grunt] Oh, for Pete's sake!
11300c Heh! Looks like this Pegasus can pitch better than the workhorse. The object of the game is to get the closest to the stake.
113008 All right, all right. You got another throw there, pony girl.
11300c [grunt]
113008 [sarcastically] Wow, Rainbow, heh. You couldn't hit a barn door with that kind of a throw!
11300c Yeah, yeah. I still have the closest throw, Applesmack. Just try and beat it.
113008 [grunt] Yee-haw! It's a ringer. That's how you do it down here on the farm.
11300c I lost.
113008 Ah, don't feel bad, Rainbow. It's all in good fun.
11300c I hate losing.
113008 Besides, you're a mighty good athlete. I'm just better. Heh heh heh.
11300c All right, Applejack, you think you're the top athlete in all of Ponyville?
113008 Well, I was gonna say in all of Equestria, but that might be gildin' the lily.
11300c ...and I think I'm the top athlete. So let's prove it.
113008 Prove what?
11300c I challenge you to an Iron Pony competition. A series of athletic contests to decide who's the best, once and for all.
113008 You know what, Rainbow? You're on.
113000 [theme song]
11300c [grunt]
113003 So you two are doing what, now?
113008 An Iron—
11300c Iron Pony competition.
113008 See, we've set up a bunch of events to decide which one of us is—
11300c The most athletic pony ever! [grunt]
113003 And I'm here to...?
11300c [grunt] I don't know. Why is she here?
113008 To be our judge and keep score.
11300c Right, heh. Somepony's gotta record my awesomeness for the history books. [grunt]
113005 Hello everypony, and welcome to the first annual Iron Pony competition!
113003 Uh, Spike, who are you talking to?
113005 Um... uh, them! Let the games begin!
11301f [cheer]
113003 Ready. Set. Go!
113008 [gasp] Dagnabbit.
113003 Time, Spike?
113005 Seventeen seconds.
113008 You're kiddin'! That breaks my record from last year's rodeo.
113005 But you got a five second penalty for nudging the barrel.
113008 [sigh] Nuts and chews! Still, that's twenty-two seconds. Not too shabby. Hey, don't be nervous. Remember, it's all in good fun. Now git on up there.
113003 Ready. Set. Go!
113008 Whoo! That was some fancy hoofwork there, Rainbow!
11300c Thanks, but I [pant] couldn't have been as fast as you.
113008 What was the time on that, Spike?
113005 Eighteen seconds!
113008 Eighteen seconds. Rainbow, are you sure you're not secretly a rodeo pony?
113003 Rainbow Dash wins the barrel lead!
11300c Oh, I can't believe I won.
113008 Yeah, well, don't you go gettin' used to it.
113000 [bell rings]
113000 [ponies cheer]
113008 Mighty respectable, [spit] but let me show ya how it's really done. [grunt]
113000 [bell rings]

113005 Why me?
113003 Go!
113005 Whoa! Whoa! Whoa-hoa! Whoa! Whoaaa! Ouch.
11300c Ready for another pony ride?
113005 No.
113003 Go!
113005 Guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guh guhwhoaaaaaa!
113003 Rainbow Dash wins the bronco-buck.
113000 [bell rings]
113005 And I lose.
113000 [ponies cheer]
113005 Whoa! [grunt] How do I get roped into these things?
11300c [grunt] Does this count?
113000 [bell rings]
113008 [grunt]
113000 [ponies cheer]
113000 [bell rings]
11300c Yuh! [blows raspberry]
113000 [ponies cheer]
113000 [bell rings]

11300c Yeah.

113005 Fillies and gentlecolts, at the halfway point, our competitors are tied at five and five.
113003 Who are you talking to?
113005 Them!
113000 [crowd chatters]
113003 Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine... a hundred!
11300c Yes!
113000 [bell rings]
113008 Be a good sport, Applejack.
113008 [grunt]
11300c [grunt]
113000 [bell rings]
113000 [hens clucking]
113000 [chicks chirping]
113008 [gasp]
113003 All right, you two. This is the final event. Give it all you've got.
11301d [grunting]
113005 Looks like the workhorse might come out ahead in this one.
113008 [muffled] That's not fair! You can't use your wings to help you win!
11300c [muffled] Huh?
113008 [muffled] You're cheatin'!
11300c [muffled] I can't understand you with that rope in your mouth.
113008 [spits] I said... uh-oh. [grunt]
113000 [crowd cheers]
113000 [bell rings]
11300c Whoo-hoo! I win by a landslide... or mudslide in your case. [chuckles] I am the Iron Pony!
113008 Only 'cause you cheated!
11300c What?
113008 You used your wingpower to help you win over half those contests!
11300c Sounds like sour apples to me.
113008 Are you sayin' you didn't use your wings?
11300c Well... no. But you never said I couldn't use my wings.
113008 I didn't think I needed to tell you to play fair.
11300c I still would have won even without my wings.
113008 Hah! Prove it.
11300c Gladly. How?
113008 Tomorrow is the annual Runnin' of the Leaves. I challenge you to race me in it.
11300c Heh! Easy shmeasy.
113008 Hold on! There is one condition - the point is to run, so no wings allowed.
11300c No wings? No problem.
113008 [spits]
11300c [spits] [blows raspberry]
113008 [chuckle]
113005 Twilight, hurry up, we're gonna be late for the race.
113003 Why are you so excited about the race? It's only for ponies.
113005 Yeah, but I'm hoping I can be the announcer again. Just listen - fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the annual Running of the--
113007 Welcome to the annual Running of the Leaves! This is Pinkie Pie, your official p-eye-in-the-sky announcer.
113003 Sorry, Spike. I guess that job's already taken.
113007 As everypony knows, the Running is a very important tradition, for without it, the autumn leaves of Equestria would never fall. So get ready, ponies. The Running of the Leaves will begin in five minutes.
113008 [grunts]
11300c Pardon me, excuse me. Make way for the Iron Pony.
113008 The Iron Phony, you mean.
11300c So, Applejack, you ready to win second place?
113008 I'm ready to run a good, clean race.
11300c Yeah, yeah...
113008 You are not allowed to use your wings.
11300c I could win this race with both wings tied behind my back.
113008 [grunts] Trussed up like a turkey. Well, a turkey who can't fly, that is.
11300c Very funny.
113008 'Least now we know we're racin' fair and square.
113000 [trumpets]
113007 Racers! Please take your positions!
113005 Um... Pinkie Pie?
113007 Hey, Spike! What's up? Oh wait, it's me! I'm up! [laughs]
113005 Uh, yeah. I know you're doing the announcing today and stuff and... I'm sure you're gonna do a great job and all, but... I was just wondering...
113007 What?
113005 Aw... forget it.
113007 Spike, would you like to be my co-reporter? We could comment on the action together.
113005 We could?
113007 Climb on up!
113008 Twilight? What in tarnation are you doin' up here?
113003 I'm racing.
11300c [laughs] Good one, Twilight.
113003 I'm not joking.
11300c What? You're not an athlete, you're a... well... you're an egghead.
113003 I am not an egghead, I am well-read.
11300c [softly] Egghead.
113008 [snickers] But have you ever run a race?
113003 Well, no, but I do know a lot about running.
11300c And you know this from...
113003 Books. I've read several on the subject.
11300c What'd you read, "The Egghead's Guide to Running"?
113003 [sighs]
11300c Did you stretch out your eye muscles to warm up? [laugh] Get it? Eye muscles.
113003 Scoff if you must, Rainbow. But the Running of the Leaves is a Ponyville tradition, and since I'm here to learn, I've decided I should experience it myself.
113008 Well, I think that's just dandy, Twilight. Good luck. [snickers]
11300c Yeah. See you at the finish line... tomorrow.
113007 All right, ponies, are you ready?
113005 Get set.
113000 [bell rings]
113007 And they're off! Welcome to the official coverage of the Running of the Leaves! You know, Spike, despite its name, the leaves don't do any of the actual running. No, that's left to my little ponies.
113005 Why, yes, Pinkie, it's the running of the ponies that causes the leaves to fall.
113007 Ugh. Those lazy, lazy leaves.
113007 But this year, the run is about more than the weather. It's about the race to the finish and the two runners who want to win it - Applejack and Rainbow Dash.
113005 You know, Pinkie, these two ponies have a bit of a grudge match they're trying to settle. Trying to prove who's the most athletic.
113007 Yes, and "grudge" rhymes with "fudge".
113005 Yes, it... does. What?
113007 And I like fudge. But if I eat too much fudge I get a pudge and then I can't budge.
113005 So... no fudge?
113007 Oh, no thanks. I had a big breakfast. Let's check in with our two competitive ponies, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Having come fast out of the gate, Applejack and Rainbow Dash are evenly matched running neck and neck. But what's this? Applejack is making a move, she's now ahead by a nose. But Rainbow Dash won't let Applejack have it and takes the lead. She's ahead by half a nose. Or maybe three quarters of a nose. No, about sixty-three point seven percent of a nose... roughly speaking. Applejack sees this move and pushes forth with her strong workhorse legs, slinking ahead by three hundred and fifty noses!
113008 Not so easy without wings, is it?
11300c Come on, Rainbow. Show 'em a little dash.
113005 Ho-hold your horses, Pinkie! Rainbow Dash is catching up to front-runner Applejack!
113007 What an upset. I thought Applejack had this in the bag.
11300c You didn't think I was gonna let you off that easily, did you?
113008 Whoa! I don't believe it.
113003 I know, it's beautiful, isn't it?
113008 Not the scenery, Twilight. Rainbow Dash just tripped me.
113003 She did not.
113008 She did too!
113003 She did not, and if you slowed down and looked where you're going, like me, you'd see that you tripped over a rock.
113008 What? Oh, hayseed! Now I got a lot of ground to make up to catch Rainbow.
113003 Just be careful!
113008 See you at the finish line!
113005 I don't believe it. After a huge setback, Applejack is back at the front of the pack.
113007 She's the head of the pack, all right. The pick of the litter! The cat's pajamas! Oh wait, why would Applejack take some poor kitty's PJs? That's not very sporting of her.
113005 Oookay... let's get back to the race.
11300c Not so fast, Applejack! This race isn't over yet!
113008 It is for you. Heh.
11300c Whoa! Guh, I don't believe it, Applejack tripped me.
113003 Don't you ponies ever look where you're going? You tripped on a stump. See?
11300c Oh, I see. A big cheater is what I see.
113003 Rainbow, Applejack would never cheat. It was just an accident.
11300c Sure it was. I mean, yeah, I'm sure it was.
113003 Remember, Rainbow, this is just a game.
11300c Yes, but the rules have changed, and two can play at that game.
113007 Welcome back, Ponyvillians, it's me, Pinkie Pie.
113005 And Spike. Looks like Rainbow is doing her best to catch up.
113007 I'm not sure how ketchup is going to help her in this contest. Now, in a hot dog eating contest it can make them doggies nice and slippery, but personally, I prefer mustard. How about you, Spike?
113005 Uh... I... like... pickles?
113007 Aaand it looks like Applejack has found herself in quite a pickle as Rainbow overtakes her.
11300c Look, ma, no wings.
113005 As the racers enter Equestria's Whitetail Wood, Rainbow Dash is back in the lead.
11300c [chuckles]
113008 Ugh. Hey, Rainbow!
11300c [blows raspberry]
113008 [gasp] Why, that little cheater did that on purpose. It's on.
11300c Nice one, Rainbow.
113008 Later!
11300c Grr! [gasp] Aaa! [laughs]
113003 Oh my, Whitetail Wood is just lovely. Hey, Rainbow, shouldn't you be up ahead?
11300c [chuckling] I'm sure to win now.
113003 Except that the other racers just passed you.
11300c Oh horse apples... see ya!
113007 Applejack, what are you doing up here?
113005 There aren't even any trees.
113008 Er, no, but the sign's pointed this way... [whinnies] Rainbow. Mind giving me a lift?
11300c What the hay?! You said no flying!
113008 No, I said no wings.
113007 I must say, Spike, that this has been the most interesting Running of the Leaves in Equestria history!
113005 With the most interesting announcing...
113007 But it isn't the running that's been fascinating. It's the lack of running!
11300c [grunt] Aaa!
113008 Whoa!
11300c Whoa!
113003 Forgive me, girls. I know I'm not an athlete, but shouldn't the Running of the Leaves actually involve running?
11300c You know, I think Twilight's right.
113008 You do?
11300c Yeah! If you wanna beat me, you better... RUUUN!
113007 Once again, Rainbow Dash and Applejack are neck and neck, jockeying for position. Applejack inches ahead, now it's Rainbow, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack...
113000 [horn blaring, crowd cheering]
113008 [grunt]
113005 Oh no, she di'int!
113007 Oh yes, she di'id!
113008 Cut it out!
11300c No, you cut it out!
113008 You started it.
11300c And now I'm gonna finish it.
113008 Oh no, you won't.
11300c Oh yes, I will. [grunt] That's it! All bets are off!
113008 Oh no, you don't.
113007 It's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash, it's Applejack, it's Rainbow Dash--
11300c I won!
113008 No, I won!
11300c I won!
113005 You tied!
11301d Tied?!
113008 For first?
113007 For last!
113008 Last?!
11300c Then who won?
11301d You?!
113003 Oh no, but I did get fifth place, which is rather good considering I've never run a race before.
113008 What? How's that even possible?
11300c You ran so slow, and looked at the scenery.
113003 Exactly. I paced myself, just like my book said. Then at the end, when all the other ponies were worn out, I sprinted to the finish.
11300c I don't believe it. Twilight beat us.
113003 Well, with all your horsing around, it was quite easy.
113008 You're right, Twilight. Our behavior was just terrible.
11300c We weren't very good sports.
113019 Sounds to me that an important lesson was learned.
11301d Princess Celestia?!
113008 W-What are you doin' here?
113019 Fall is one of my favorite seasons, so I came to celebrate the Running of the Leaves.
113008 I'm sorry you had to see us being such poor sports, Princess.
113019 That's all right, Applejack. Anypony can get swept up in the excitement of competition.
113003 It's important to remember that the friendship is always more important than the competition.
113019 Exactly, Twilight. Now, unfortunately, because the two of you were busy tricking each other instead of shaking down leaves, many of the lovely trees of Equestria are still covered.
113008 Why, Princess, I bet we can knock those leaves down for you lickety-split. Whaddya say, friend? Wanna go for another run?
11300c I'd love to stretch my legs.
113000 [music]
113000 [credits]
11400d Oh, Opalescence. Can't you just picture it? Moi, stepping out in a stunning new gown at the Grand Galloping Gala in Canterlot!
11406a [meows]
11400d Why, yes! I did make it myself. Thank you so much for asking.
11406a [low growl]
11400d Oh, Opal, of course you can help me. Thank you.
11406a [low growl]
11400d What's that? You want to help me more? Oh, aren't you the sweetest thing?
11406a [meows]
11400d Careful now. Don't move. This shouldn't take long at all.
11406a [low growl]
114000 [theme song]
114000 [knocking]
114008 Howdy, Rarity!
114003 Shh! [whispering] Can't you see Rarity is trying to concentrate?
114008 What do you think she's makin'?
114003 Looks like a dress.
114008 Well, that makes sense. Since this is a dressmaker's shop and all.
11400d Is there something I can help you with?
114003 Oh, so very sorry to trouble you, Rarity, but I need a quick favor. Could you please fix the button for me? It's my dress for the Grand Galloping Gala.
11400d [gasps] Oh, no, no, no! You can't wear this... old thing. You need a glamorous new outfit for the Gala and I'll make it for you. No problem at all. It will be my pleasure!
114003 Oh, that's really sweet of you to offer, Rarity, but I can't let you do that. It would be so much work. This dress is fine.
11400d Twilight Sparkle. I insist on making you a new dress.
114003 But...
11400d Not another word! I won't take no for an answer.
114003 Well, in that case... thank you for your generosity, Rarity. Knowing your handiwork, I'm sure it will be absolutely beautiful.
11400d Let me guess, Applejack. You don't want a new gown either.
114008 Gown? Shoot. I was just gonna wear my old work duds.
11400d You can't possibly be serious, Applejack! You absolutely must wear formal attire.
114008 Hmm... Nah.
11400d What if I just spruce up your, uh... duds for you a little bit?
114008 Um... okay, sure, why not? Since you're up for it and all. Just don't make them too... frou-frou-y.
11400d Deal!
11400c Look out below!
114000 [crash]
11400c Sorry. New trick. Didn't quite work.
11400d Hmm... [gasp] Idea! I'll make you an outfit for the Gala too, Rainbow Dash!
11400c Outfit for the what now?
11400d I'll make one for you and you and all of you! Ooh! And of course Pinkie and Fluttershy too. Oh, and when I'm done, we can hold our very own fashion show!
114003 What a great idea! If you're sure you can handle it.
11400d Oh, it'll be a little bit of work, but it will be a wonderful boost for my business. Plus, fun!
11400c Oh, I love fun things!
11400d Then it's settled. We'll have a fashion show starring us!
11406b [Yay! Yeah!]
114008 So all you have to do is make a different, stunning, original, amazing outfit for one, two, three, four, five—plus yourself—six ponies? And lickety split?
11400d [chuckling] Oh, Applejack. You make it sound as if it's going to be hard.
11400d [Rarity]
11400d Thread by thread, stitching it together
11400d Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip
11400d Making sure the fabric folds nicely
11400d It's the perfect color and so hip
11400d Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
11400d Making sure the clothes' correctly facing
11400d I'm stitching Twilight's dress
11400d Yard by yard, fussing on the details
11400d Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
11400d Make her something perfect to inspire
11400d Even though she hates formal attire
11400d Gotta mind those intimate details
11400d Even though she's more concerned with sales
11400d It's Applejack's new dress
11400d Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink
11400d Fluttershy something breezy
11400d Blend color and form,
114000 [To Opalescence] Do you think it looks cheesy?
114000 Something brash, perhaps quite fetching
114000 Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die?
114000 Making sure it fits forelock and crest
114000 Don't forget some magic in the dress
114000 Even though it rides high on the flank
114000 Rainbow won't look like a tank
114000 I'm stitching Rainbow's dress
114000 Piece by piece, snip by snip
114000 Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
114000 Thread by thread, primmed and pressed
114000 Yard by yard, never stressed
114000 And that's the art of the dress!
11400d That's it. Keep them closed. Don't look. Okay, you can look now!
11406c [gasp]
11400d These are your new outfits. What do you think of your old duds now, Applejack? Pretty swanky, are they not? And Twilight! I made this dress for you, and I designed each outfit theme to perfectly reflect each pony's unique personality. Oh, it took me forever to get the colors right on this one, Rainbow Dash, but I did it. Oh, and it turned out beautiful, don't you think? And I know you are going to love yours, Fluttershy. It just sings spring! And Pinkie Pie, look! Pink! Your favorite! Aren't they all amazing?
114000 [pause]
114003 Wow... they're...
11400c Yeah, they're...
114008 They sure are... somethin'.
114003 Yes! Something.
114007 I love something! Something is my favorite!
11400e It's... nice.
11400d But what's the matter? Don't you like them?
114003 They're very nice...
114008 And we're plumb grateful 'cause you worked so hard on them.
11400c Mine's just not as cool as I was imagining. She asked.
114003 I guess what we're all saying is that they're just not what we had in mind.
11406d [Yeah. Uh-huh.]
11400d [sigh] That's okay. Not a problem. There's plenty more where that came from. They were only a first pass. You're my friends and I want you to be one hundred and ten percent satisfied. Not to worry, I'll redo them.
11400e Oh, Rarity. You don't have to do that. They're fine.
11400d I want them to be better than just fine. I want you to think they're absolutely perfect.
114008 Are you sure? I mean, we wouldn't wanna impose.
11400d Oh, it's no imposition. Really, I insist.
114003 Well, in that case... thank you again, Rarity.
11400d [strained laughter] What have I gotten myself into?
11400e Hello? You wanted to see me, Rarity?
11400d Fluttershy! Your new-new gown's ready. I completely revised it, and I know you're going to love it!
11400d What do you think?
11400e I... love it.
11400d Oh, you're just saying that.
11400e No, no. I do. It's... nice.
11400d "Nice"?
11400e Nice.
11400d If you don't like it, you should just tell me.
11400e Oh, but I do like it.
11400d Like it or love it?
11400e Um... both?
11400d Which is it?
11400e Please stop asking me this, I...
11400d Well, just tell me what you really think.
11400e No, that's okay...
11400d Tell me.
11400e No... it's fine...
11400d Tell me!
11400e I... like it...
11400d Tell me, tell me, tell-me-tell-me-tell-me!
11400e All right! Since you really wanna know... [inhales] the armscye's tight, the middy collar doesn't go with the shawl lapel, the hems are clearly machine-stitched, the pleats are uneven, the fabric looks like toile, you used a backstitch here when it clearly called for a topstitch or maybe a traditional blanket stitch, and the overdesign is reminiscent of prêt-à-porter and not true French haute couture. But, uh... you know... um, whatever you want to do is fine.
114003 Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.
11400d [Rarity]
11400d Stitch by stitch, stitching it together
11400d Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?
11400d Even if my fabric choice was perfect
11400d Gotta get them all done by tonight
11400d Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive
11400d Wait until you see it in the light
11400d I'm sewing them together!
114007 Don't you think my gown would be more "me" with some lollipops?
11400d Well, I think...
114007 Balloons?
11400d Well...
114007 Do it!
11400d [Rarity]
11400d Hour by hour, one more change
11400d I'm sewing them together, take great pains
11400d Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
11400d Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?
11400d Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
11400d Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine
11400d Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call
11400d Brings a whole new revision
11400d Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision
114003 That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.
11400e French haute couture, please.
11400d Ugh...
114008 What if it rains? Galoshes!
114007 More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
11400d Streamers?
114007 Whose dress is this?
11400d Streamers it is.
11400c What?
11400d Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
11400c No, I just want my dress to be cool.
11400d Do you not like the color?
11400c The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
11400d Do you not like the shape?
11400c The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about twenty percent cooler.
114007 [Pinkie Pie]
114007 All we ever want is indecision
11400c [Rainbow Dash]
11400c All we really like is what we know
114003 [Twilight Sparkle]
114003 Gotta balance style with adherence
11400e [Fluttershy]
11400e Making sure we make a good appearance
114008 [Applejack]
114008 Even if you simply have to fudge it
11406c [Mane Six except Rarity]
11406c Make sure that it stays within our budget
11400d [Rarity]
11400d Got to overcome intimidation
11400d Remember, it's all in the presentation!
11400d Piece by piece, snip by snip
11400d Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
11400d Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
11400d Yard by yard, always stressed
11400d And that's the art of the dress!
11400d Oh, Opal. These are the ugliest dresses I've ever made.
11400d Okay. I did exactly what each of you asked for. Now don't hold back. Let me know what you really think.
114003 Oh my!
11400e It's... perfect!
11400c It's cool!
114008 Why, they're the best duds I ever did see.
11406c It's exactly what I asked for!
11400d [sighs]
114003 Thank you, Rarity.
114007 Are you as happy with them as we are? Huh? Huh? Huh?
11400d Well, I'm... happy that all of you are happy. I'm just relieved to finally be done.
114000 [door opens]
114005 You are never gonna believe this! You've heard of Hoity Toity?
114003 The bigwig fashion hotshot in Canterlot?
114005 Uh-huh. He heard about your fashion show. Well, maybe I happened to mention it to him... he's coming here all the way from Canterlot to see your work, Rarity!
114008 Whoa, Nelly! You could sell a ton o' dresses to this guy. Your business will be boomin'!
114003 Wow!
11400c That's so cool!
114007 I don't believe it!
11400d Hoity Toity? He's coming here? To see these dresses?
114005 Yep! Get ready for all of your dreams to come true.
11400d Oh. [gasp] There he is!
11406e [claps hooves]
11400d [deep breaths] Okay. Relax, Rarity. Your friends like their outfits and so will he. [squeals] What's wrong with the lights?! Oh, yes. That means the show's starting. Good.
114000 [music]
114005 Since the beginning of time, the elite of Equestria have longed for pony fashions that truly expressed the essence of their very souls. Patiently waiting decades—no, centuries—for the perfect pony gown. Today, at long last, Equestria, your wait is over! Let's hear it for the breathtaking designs of Ponyville's own Rarity!
114000 [ponies murmuring]
114008 Why's everypony lookin' at us like that?
114003 Oh dear.
11400c You think we overdid it?
114008 Nah. Okay, maybe a little.
11406e Oh, those amateurish designs look like a piled-on mishmash of everything but the kitchen sink! It's a travesty is what it is. Those outfits are the ugliest things I've ever seen, oh for shame! Who is responsible for subjecting our eyes to these horrors? Not to mention wasting my valuable time.
11400d Oh! [to Opal] Hide me.
114005 Come on out and take a bow, Rarity. You worked really hard for this. Yes! All right, woo-hoo! Go, Rarity!
114007 Rarity? You okay in there? You haven't come out for days.
11400d I'm never coming out! I can't show my face in Ponyville ever again! I used to be somepony. I used to be respected. I made dresses. Beautiful, beautiful dresses! But now everypony is laughing at me. I'm nothing but a laughing stock! [sobs]
114003 You're not a laughing stock, Rarity...
11400c She kind of is.
114003 Shhh! Come on out and talk to us.
11400d [sobbing] Leave me alone! I vant to be alone! I want to wallow in... whatever it is that ponies are supposed to wallow in! Do ponies wallow in pity? Oh, listen to me, I don't even know what I'm supposed to wallow in! I'm so pathetic!
114003 Now what do we do?
11400e Uh... panic?
11400c That's your answer for everything!
114008 Well, we can't just leave Rarity like this.
114007 She'll become a crazy cat lady!
114003 She only has one cat.
114007 Give her time.
114003 Hmm...
11400d Exile... I guess technically I'd have to move away to live in exile. Where would I go? And what would I pack? Oh, it's going to take me forever to do all of that packing. What are you supposed to pack when you go to exile? Are you supposed to pack warm?
11406a [meowing]
11400d Huh? Opal?
11406a [meowing]
11400d Opal, how did you get up there? Hang on, you poor dear! Mama's coming!
114000 [door opens]
11400d [gasp] Rainbow Dash?! How dare you strand my poor Opal in a tree!
11400c Well, how else were we gonna get you out here to show you this?
11400d What is it? It's not... you... [gasp]
114007 We all finished your dress for you.
114008 Thanks to Fluttershy's freaky knowledge of sewing.
11400e Do you like it?
11400d Like it? Like it?!
11400e Uh-uh. She doesn't like it.
11400d No, I don't like it.
11406c Awwww...
11400d I love it!
11406c Yay!
11400d You ponies did an amazing job. It's exactly the way I imagined it.
11400e We just followed your brilliant design.
114003 Like we should have let you do for our outfits. Those first dresses you designed were perfect.
114007 We're so super sorry.
11400c You worked really hard to make our dresses exactly the way we wanted them. We all saw how well that turned out.
11400d Oh, I forgive you.
114008 Well, that's mighty big of you.
11400d But my whole career is still ruined!
114008 Oh, right. That.
114003 Maybe not.
11406e All right, I haven't got all day.
11406e Take two.
114000 [music: Twilight's dress]
11406e Hello... oh, this can't be the same designer.
114000 [music: Applejack's dress]
11406e Simply magnificent! And I suddenly have a fierce craving for some Dutch apple pie, candied apples on a stick, apple turnovers, apple cobbler...
114000 [music: Pinkie Pie's dress]
11406e Brilliant!
114000 [thunder]
114000 [music: Rainbow Dash's dress]
11406e Oh, spectacular!
114000 [music: Fluttershy's dress]
11406e Now this is a fashion show! All of these dresses are absolutely amazing. Who is responsible? Step forward, show yourself!
114000 [music: Rarity's dress]
11406e Brava! Brava! Magnifico! Encore!
11400d Oh, thank you. Thank you! Oh, thank you so much!
114003 Dear Princess Celestia,
114003 This week, my very talented friend Rarity learned that if you try to please everypony, you often times end up pleasing nopony, especially yourself. And I learned this - when somepony offers to do you a favor, like making you a beautiful dress, you shouldn't be overly critical of something generously given to you. In other words, you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. [giggles]
11406e Rarity, my congratulations to you on a most impressive fashion debut. Would you do me the great honor of allowing me to feature your couture in my Best of the Best Boutique in Canterlot?
11400d [gasp]
11406e Now, I'll need you to make a dozen of each dress for me by next Tuesday.
11400d [strained laugh]
114000 [music]
114000 [credits]
115003 Tuh! Nuh! Uh! Nyuh!
115000 [magic chimes]
115003 Eyes over here, Spike!
115005 Uh, sorry.
115003 For this to work, it's crucial we keep our concentration totally on the—
115007 Ooh!
115005 Nyuh!
115003 Spike! This magic needs our full attention to make it happen. There's no other way!
115005 I can't help it. Look!
115000 [various sound effects]
115003 Ugh, never mind her. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
115005 Super-extra Pinkie Pie today.
115007 Hmm... Twitchy twitcha twitcha twitch.
115003 Pinkie Pie? What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you up to?
115007 Oh! It's my tail! It's my tail! It's a-twitch a-twitchin'! And you know what that means!
115003 Actually, Pinkie, I haven't the slightest idea.
115007 The twitchin' means my Pinkie Sense is telling me that stuff's gonna start falling! You two better duck for cover.
115003 Oh, Pinkie, it's not gonna rain. Why, there's barely even a cloud in the-ugh!
115000 [frog croaks]
115007 He just said "nice catch" in Frog.
115000 [frog croaks]
115000 [theme song]
11500e Oh, I'm so, so sorry. You okay, Twilight Sparkle? I just couldn't stand to see the pond getting so over-populated, what with the frogs all hopping into each other and all, so I decided to fly as many as I can on over to Froggy Bottom Bogg.
115003 Of course you did.
11500e [muffled] Bye-bye!
115007 Um... Twilight? You gotta little somethin' on your face there.
115003 Oh, really? Did your Pinkie Sense tell you that, too?
115007 Nah. I could just see it. La-la-la-la-la...
115003 C'mon, Spike, let's continue our practice session where there's a little less commotion.
115005 Wow! That was amazing! Pinkie Pie predicted something would fall, and it did!
115003 Oh, come on. She said that something would fall, and a frog just happened to fall right around the same time. A coincidence, nothing else to it.
115007 My tail! My tail! Twitch-a-twitch! Twitch-a-twitch! Somethin' else is gonna fall!
115003 Oh, Pinkie, please. Nothing else is gonna fa— aaah!
115005 Oh no, Twilight fell! Is it... safe to go help her?
115007 It's okay, my tail stopped twitching. La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la...
115005 Ha ha! That was amazing!
115003 Oh, please.
115008 Uh, Twilight? Why are you hanging out in a ditch?
115005 Because, Pinkie Pie predicted it!
115003 Honestly, Spike, she did not. Two coincidences in a row like this may be unlikely, but it's still easier to believe than twitchy tails that predict the future.
115008 [gasp] Twitchy tail? Pinkie Sense? Whoa! Nyu-uh!
115005 Don't worry, it's safe. Prediction already came true.
115003 Oh, wait. Don't tell me you believe in this stuff, too?
115008 I know it doesn't make much sense, but those of us who have been in Ponyville a while have learned over time that, if Pinkie's a-twichin', you better listen.
115007 My ears are flopping! My ears are flopping!
115005 Nyuh! What does that mean?!
115007 I'll start a bath for you.
115003 Huh? [chuckles] A bath? This thing keeps on getting more ridiculous by the minute!
115000 [splash]
115003 [grumble]
115003 [blows]
115007 Sooo, basically, it works like this - I get different little niggly feelings, and they mean different things. Like when my back is itchy, it means it's my lucky day. And when my knee gets pinchy, that means something scary's about to happen.
115003 Is your knee pinchy now?
115007 No, but my shoulder's achy. That means there's an alligator in the tub.
115000 [splash]
115003 [scream] How come your knee didn't get pinchy?! That isn't just scary, it's downright dangerous!
115007 No, it's not, silly! This is my pet alligator, Gummy. He's got no teeth. See? Haha!
115003 Okay, okay... I get it.
115003 Well, I still don't believe all this... "special power" stuff. It's just a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
115007 What's not to believe? You do magic, what's the difference?
115003 Huge! For one thing, [clears throat] magic is something you study and practice. It only happens when you decide to do it, and it's meant to make something specific that you choose to happen, happen. With you, uh, it makes no sense at all!
115007 That's so not true, Twilight! Sometimes it's a bunch of random things happening to my body at random times that supposedly predict the future. I call 'em "combos".
115003 Combos?
115007 Sure! You know, like, ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. That means the sky is about to be graced with a beautiful rainbow!
115003 Yeah, sure.
115007 Uh-oh, I feel a combo coming on. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch!
115000 [crash]
115003 Ugh!
115000 [beeping]
115003 Ughhh... You said that combo meant "beautiful rainbow".
115007 Oh no-no-no-no-no. You're thinking of an ear flop, then knee twitch, then eye flutter. This was an ear flop, then eye flutter, then knee twitch. That usually means "look out for opening doors". You okay?
115003 I don't believe this.
115007 You don't believe because you don't understand.
115003 Hmm...
115003 Okay. Now when you get another twitch, we'll have all kinds of scientific information.
115007 Okie-dokie-lokie!
115000 [steam stack whistling periodically]
115003 Any twitches yet?
115007 Nopey-dopey!
115003 Now? Anything?
115007 Wait! Hold on! Uhh, no.
115003 Are you kidding me?! After a whole day of nonstop twitching, now that I've got you all hooked up, you're not getting a single one?
115007 I don't control it, they just come and go.
115003 That makes no sense!
115007 Sometimes you just have to believe in things, even when you can't figure 'em out.
115003 I will not believe in anything I cannot explain.
115007 Wait, hold on, I'm feeling something...
115003 Oh my gosh, what? What is it?!
115000 [Pinkie Pie's stomach growls]
115007 It's my tummy! That usually means I'm hungry! Let's eat!
115003 Urgh... You know what? [bite] [snap] Just forget it! I don't need to know if this is real or not. I don't need to understand it! I don't even care!
115007 Okie-dokie-lokie. [gasp] Uh-oh. [gasp] Hu-bu-bu-bu-buh!
115000 [smash]
115005 Pinkie? Have you seen Twilight?
115007 Uh-huh.
115005 Twilight? What are ya doing back there?
115003 Rrrrgh... Did you two plan this?
115005 Plan what?
115003 Urgh! This is ridiculous. This can't be happening. This makes no sense. I have to figure this out.
115000 [frog croaks]
115000 [frogs croaking]
115007 [giggling] [sniff] Mmm... [giggling]
115000 [tribal music]
115005 Twilight?
115003 Ah!
115005 Whoa-oh-uh!
115003 Honestly, Spike, don't you know better than to sneak up on ponies?
115005 Oh, sorry, but, um, well, isn't that what you're doing?
115003 [gasp] No! I'm doing scientific research. I'm observing Pinkie Pie, scientific name Pinkius pieicus, in its natural habitat.
115005 Pinkius-whoicus? Hh!
115003 There's something fishy going on with the whole twitchy prediction thing, and I'm getting to the bottom of it. So shh. Come on. Pinkius pieicus is on the move.
115007 [humming]
115003 Hm... Itchy nose...
115007 [gasp]
115003 Aha! That makes no sense. See? She's hiding like something's about to fall from the sky, but a twitchy tail means something's gonna fall from the sky, not an itchy nose.
115000 [swarm of bees buzzing]
115003 This proves...
115005 [gasp]
115003 ...perhaps conclusively, that—
115005 Gah!
115003 Spike! Where are you going? I'm trying to teach you the value of scientific—
115000 [swarm buzzing]
115003 Ow! Ouch! Ow! [whimper]
115005 What's she doing now?
115003 Smelling a flower.
115005 Holy guacamole! I wonder what that means?
115003 Probably that the flower smells good. Wait. I'm getting something. Ear flop, eye flutter, knee twitch.
115005 Hold on... You told me that's the combo that says "watch out for opening doors"!
115003 Oh-ho. You really, really believe this stuff, don't you? Here, let me show you there's nothing to be afraid of. You see? I promise you there's nothing to fear from that— Wo-o-ah! Ow! Ugh! Ow! Ow!
115008 Twilight! You came to visit my new apple cellar, how nice. Twi? You okay? Uh, Twi?
115005 Here, let me help you.
115003 Okay, take this down - twitchy tail.
115005 Twitchy tail? [gasp] Twitchy tail!
115003 Hush, Spike! We can't let Pinkie know we're here, remember?
115005 Something's gonna fall, something's gonna fall! Run for your lives. Ah-ha-ha!
115003 Ugh. Spike, honestly. You're overreact—
115000 [crack]
115000 [clang]
115000 [smash]
115000 [crash]
115003 Ugh!
115007 [humming] Hey, Applejack. Whatcha doin'?
115008 Takin' more apples to my new apple cellar. How 'bout you, Pinkie? Whatchu doin'?
115007 Oh, letting Twilight secretly follow me all day without me knowing.
115003 You mean you knew all along?! Why didn't you tell me?!
115007 [giggles] Silly, that would've spoiled the secret!
115003 Urgh!
115005 Tail... still twitching?
115007 All done, clear skies from here on in, as far as I can tell— Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
115005 Oh no! What does that one mean?
115007 Dunno, never gotten any like it before, but whatever that shudder's about, it's a doozy. Something you'd never expect to happen is gonna happen! Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu hu-bu-bu-bu! And it's gonna happen... at Froggy Bottom Bogg!
115008 [gasp] That's where Fluttershy's headed!
115005 Oh no! Is it about her?
115007 Uh, I'm not sure.
115008 We better go and make sure she's okay.
115003 Calm down, everypony. All we know right now is that Pinkie Pie just got a case of the shivers. That's all.
115005 Guh— Hey! I thought you didn't believe in this stuff?
115003 I don't. I just want to be there to see the look on Pinkie's face when we find out nothing's wrong.
115007 Okie-dokie!
115000 [gate creaks]
115000 [frogs croak]
115007 [shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
115003 Cold? Need a jacket or something?
115007 No thanks, I'm fine. [shivers] Hu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu!
115005 So... Whadda'ya think happened to Fluttershy?
115008 I hope nothin'.
115005 I know, but, whadda'ya think happened?
115008 I'm tryin' not to think about it.
115005 Me too. But I'm thinkin' about it anyway. Like, what if she exploded?
115008 Just exploded? For no reason?
115005 Yeah, like boom!
115007 Whoa!
115005 I know.
115007 What if... What if she exploded, and then... and then exploded again?!
115005 Can you do that? Can you explode twice?
115008 Of course not.
115005 But what if she exploded, and exploded again, and then— ugh!
115003 Will you two stop? She's fine, I'm sure of it.
115008 I hope you're right, for Fluttershy's sake. Look! There's Froggy Bottom Bogg!
115000 [dragonfly buzzing]
115008 Fluttershy?
115007 Fluttershy? [gasp]
115005 Fluttershy! You're okay!
11500e Of course.
115008 Phew, what a relief.
115007 I'm so glad everything's all right.
115003 Sorry, I know it's not nice to gloat but... Aha! I told you there was nothing to worry about, and I was right. Pinkie Pie said whatever she was shuddering about was a [cough] doozy, and [cough] and the only [cough] doozy here is how right I am.
115008 Um... Twilight?
115003 Pinkie's made a lot of predictions today but [cough] ugh, what is that smell? But what we've shown here is that there's no point in believing [cough] in anything you can't see for yourself.
115005 W-Well t-then, s-see what's b-b-behind you, Twilight!
115000 [hydra growls]
115003 I see it... but I don't believe it!
115000 [hydra roars]
115007 Is that a hydra?!
115008 Who cares? Run!
115000 [ponies screaming]
115007 [whimper]
115003 Pinkie! Come on!
115007 Ooph! [pant]
11500e Oh, I'm so sorry.
115000 [hydra roars]
11500e Ah!
115000 [hydra head laughs]
115000 [ponies and Spike screaming]
115003 Everypony up that hill!
115005 He-e-elp!
115003 Coming, Spike! Hang on!
115000 [hydra growls]
115003 I think we're gonna make it.
115005 But Pinkie's still shuddering!
115007 Oh, lookie there, it stopped. O-h-h-h, t-h-e-r-e i-t i-s a-g-a-i-n!
115000 [ponies gasp]
115003 Ugh, he'll be up here in no time! Quick, one at a time, cross!
115005 Nyu-uh! Uh, do you know any spells for turning a hydra into a mouse?
115003 No.
115005 How about a squirrel?
115003 No!
115005 How 'bout—
115003 No small rodents of any kind!
115005 That's too bad.
11500e A hop, skip, and a... jump!
115005 Whoa-ho!
115007 Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa!
115008 [grunt]
115045 He's too close. I'll distract him. You two go, now!
115000 [whoosh]
115003 Oh... What would a brave pony like Rainbow Dash do? Chaaarge!
115000 [hydra chirps]
115000 [smack]
115007 T-T-T-Twilight!
115000 [hydra chirps]
115000 [crash]
115000 [crumble]
115000 [ponies gasp]
115000 [hydra roars]
115007 T-T-T-Twilight! You have to jump!
115003 I'll never make it!
115007 You'll be fine!
115003 I will not!
115000 [hydra roars]
115007 It's your only ho-o-ope! You have to take a leap of faith!
115003 [gulp]
115000 [crash]
115003 Y-ugh! No! Oh no! Noooo! WA-A-A-AH! Ugh! Blegh!
115000 [ponies cheer]
115007 I knew you could do it, Twilight!
115003 I don't know how it happened—coincidence, dumb luck, or what—but you said there'd be a doozy here at Froggy Bottom Bogg, and I'd say we just had ourselves one heck of a doozy. I mean that hydra—
115007 [shudders]
115003 Pinkie?
115007 That wasn't it.
115003 Huh?
115005 What wasn't what?
115008 What are you talking about, Pink?
115007 The hydra wasn't the doozy.
115000 [hydra blows raspberry]
115007 I'm still getting the shudders. Oo-o-oh, oo-o-oh! You see? There it is again. Whatever the doozy was at Froggy Bottom Bogg, my Pinkie Sense says it still hasn't happened.
115003 Huh? But I— WHAT?! The hydra wasn't the doozy? How could it not be the doozy?! What could be doozier than that?!
115007 Dunno, but it just wasn't it.
115000 [kettle whistles]
115003 Rrrgh... [flames and growls] Ooh... I give up...
115005 Give what up, Twi?
115003 The fight. I can't fight it anymore. I don't understand how, why, or what, but Pinkie Sense somehow... makes sense. I don't see how it does, but it just does. Just because I don't understand doesn't mean it's not true.
115007 Y-Y-Y-You m-m-mean you b-b-b-believe?
115003 Yup, I guess I do.
115007 Oo-woo-oo-oo-oo, woo-oo-oo-oo-oh, woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh! Ooh! [gasp] That was it! That's the doozy!
115005 Bbrrbbrrbbrr.
115003 What? What is?
115007 You believing! I never expected that to happen! That was the doozy. Oh, and oh what a doozy of a doozy it was! La-la-la-la-la...
115000 [giggling]
115003 Oh, good, Spike, you're here. Take a letter.
115005 With pleasure, Twilight.
115003 Dear Princess Celestia, I'm happy to report that— Spike, what have I been saying about focus?
115005 I know, but I... Well...
115003 What's wrong, Spike? Never thought you'd see me with an umbrella hat on?
115005 Not really, no.
115003 Pinkie's tail's a-twitchin'. What else can I do?
115000 [laughter]
115003 I am happy to report that I now realize there are wonderful things in this world you just can't explain, but that doesn't necessarily make them any less true. It just means you have to choose to believe in them, and sometimes it takes a friend to show you the way.
115007 Honk!
115005 Honk.
115003 Always your faithful student, Twilight Sparkle.
115007 There it goes again.
115003 I wonder what's gonna drop outta the sky this time?
115007 You never know.
115005 [inhales]
115000 [crash]
115005 Twitchy tail? Holy guacamole!
115000 [music]
115000 [credits]
11600c Now, what have we learned?
11600e Loss of control.
11600c Good.
11600e Screaming and hollering.
11600c Yes, and most importantly?
11600e Passion!
11600c Right! So now that you know the elements of a good cheer, let's hear one.
11600e [inhales] Yay.
11600c ...Ugh. You're gonna cheer for me like that? Louder.
11600e Yay.
11600c Louder!
11600e Yay.
11600c Louder!
11600e [deep breath] [quietly] Yaaay.
11600c Ugh...
116000 [thud]
11600e Too loud?
116000 [theme song]
11600e Yay.
11600c [deep breath] And now, phase one of my routine.
11600e Wooo.
11600c Phase two.
11600e Way to go.
11600c Here we go. Phase three. The sonic rainboom. C'mon! [grunt] Uh-oh. [scream]
116003 [sigh] Last one. Thank you so much for helping me clean up all these books, guys. It was a crazy week of studying.
11600c [screams]
116000 [crash]
116003 [grunt]
116007 [grunt]
116008 [grunt]
11600e Rainbow Dash, you rock! Woohoo. [gasp] Did my cheering do that?
11600c Hehe. Sorry about that, ladies. That was a truly feeble performance.
11600e Actually, it wasn't all bad. I particularly liked it when you made the clouds spin.
11600c Ugh. I'm not talking about my performance, I'm talking about yours. That feeble cheering!
116003 What are you two arguing about?
11600e Were we arguing? I'm sorry.
11600c [grunt] I wish you guys could come to Cloudsdale to see me compete in the Best Young Flyer Competition.
116003 What's that?
116007 It's where all the greatest Pegasus flyers get together and show off their different flying styles! Some are fast! [makes car sounds] And some are graceful. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
116008 Golly. I'd love to see you strut yer stuff in that competition.
11600c Yeah. I wish you guys could be there. Fluttershy's a great support, but her cheering isn't exactly inspirational.
116007 Ooh! I'd love to see you make a sonic rainboom! It's like, the most coolest thing ever! Even though I've never actually seen it, but I mean come on! It's a sonic rainboom! How not cool could it possibly not be?!
116003 What's a sonic rainboom?
116007 You really need to get out more. The sonic rainboom is legendary! When a Pegasus like Rainbow Dash gets going sooo fast... Boom! A sonic boom and a rainbow can happen all at once!
116008 And Rainbow Dash here's the only pony to ever pull it off!
11600c It was a long time ago... I was just a filly.
116007 Yeah, but you're gonna do it again, right?
11600c Are... you kidding? I'm the greatest flyer to ever come out of Cloudsdale! I could do sonic rainbooms in my sleep.
116003 Wow. If you pull that off, you'll win the crown for sure!
11600c The grand prize is an entire day with the Wonderbolts. A whole day of flying with my lifelong heroes... It'll be a dream come true!
11600e Yay.
11600c I'm gonna go rest up. Don't wanna over prepare myself, y'know. Hehe. You, on the other hand, better keep practicing. I need a cheering section to match my spectacular performance.
11600e She's practiced that move a hundred times, and she's never even come close to doing it. I don't know if I can cheer loud enough to help her.
116003 Well, guess we better get this cleaned up... again.
11600d Go on, go on.
116003 Go on what?
11600d Find a spell that will get us wingless ponies into Cloudsdale. Didn't you see how nervous she was?
116008 Nervous? Have you spit yer bit or somethin'? She was tootin' her own horn louder than the brass section of a marching band!
11600d Oh, puh-lease. I have put on enough fashion shows to recognize stage fright when I see it. We've got to find a way to be there for her. Now go on!
116003 Owaa! Ugh. How am I supposed to find a flight spell in this mess?
116007 A flight spell? One sec. Page twenty-seven.
116008 How'd you do that?
116007 It landed on my face when Rainbow Dash knocked me into the bookcase.
116003 Here it is! A spell that will allow Earth ponies to fly for three days. Ooh, it looks really difficult... I'm not sure I can do it.
11600d You've got to try!
116003 Okay... But who's gonna volunteer to be the test subject?
11600d I will! For Rainbow Dash, I will go first.
116003 Here goes. [grunts] [screams]
116008 [gasp]
116003 I think it worked!
11600c You've got to learn to be assertive, Fluttershy. Don't be afraid to speak up.
11606f Well, well, well. What do we have here?
116070 It's our old friend Rainbow Crash!
11606f Get kicked outta any flight schools lately?
116071 [laughs]
11600c I didn't get kicked out.
11606f Face it, Rainbow Crash. Flight school had too many rules and not enough naptimes for you.
116070 Huh, ask her about the sonic rainboom.
11606f That's nothin' but an old mare's tale. You don't have the skills to try something like that.
11600e Now wait just a minute! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm trying to be more assertive. Anyhow, she is going to do a sonic rainboom!
11606f No, she's not, 'cause there's no such thing!
11600e Then show up at the Cloudeseum and see for yourself! ...If you're free.
116071 [laughs]
116070 [within laughter] Yeah, I'll be free.
11606f Oh, don't worry. We'll be there!
116070 See you then, Rainbow Crash!
11600e Did you see that? I was so assertive!
11600c [sigh] Those guys are right. I'll never be able to do it.
11600e But Rainbow Dash, just because you've failed the sonic rainboom a hundred thousand times in practice doesn't mean you won't be able to do it in front of an entire stadium, full of impatient, super-critical sportsfan ponies.
11600c Aaaaaah! What do I do?! Everypony's gonna see me fail! The Wonderbolts will never let a loser like me join! Princess Celestia will probably banish me to the Everfree Forest! My life is ruined!
11600e Rare...
11600c Rare?! The sonic rainboom is way more than rare!
11600e Rarity?
11600c Rarity! Are you... flying?!
11600d I most certainly am! Aren't my wings smashing?! Twilight made them for me. I just adore them! Why so shocked? We couldn't leave our favorite flyer without a big cheering section!
11600c "We"? I... I can't believe it!
11600e It's incredible!
11600c This is so cool! You guys made it!
116007 Sure did!
11600c Wait! How'd you do that? Only Pegasus ponies can walk on clouds.
116007 Haha. Pretty cool, huh?
116003 I found a spell that makes temporary wings, but it was too difficult to do more than once. So I found an easier spell that lets the rest of us walk on clouds.
116008 And we came to cheer you to victory!
11600c To be honest, I was starting to get just the teeniest, tiniest bit nervous. But I feel a lot better now that you guys are here. Hey, we've got some time before the competition. Why don't Fluttershy and I show you around Cloudsdale?
116073 Yes!
11600c Here it is - the greatest city in the sky!
116074 Oooh! Aaah!
11600d [in mirror] Oooh! Aaah!
11600c Uhh... Some of the greatest Pegasi in history came from Cloudsdale!
11600d Oh, wait for me!
116000 [jackhammer sounds]
116075 Those wings are gorgeous!
11600d Why, thank you!
116003 Be careful with those wings, Rarity. They're made from gossamer and morning dew, and they're incredibly delicate.
11600d Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure they can't get worn out from too much attention.
116008 Since we're up here, I'd sure like to get a look at where the weather's made.
11600c Great idea! C'mon, girls. To the weather factory!
116000 [thunder]
11600c This is where they make the snowflakes. Each one is hoofmade. As you can see, it's a delicate operation.
11600d [gasp] Ooh, the snowflakes look even better from up here.
116000 [snowflake workers grumbling and yelling]
11600c We better move on before Rarity ruins winter and causes a drought.
11600c And here's where they make the rainbows!
116007 [slurp] [pants] Spicyyyyyy!...
116008 [laughs]
11600c Yeah, rainbows aren't really known for their flavor.
11606f Whoa! Oh, where'd you get those amazing wings? I want a pair!
11600d Hmm... Yeah, I guess I could see that.
11606f Oh, hey look, it's Rainbow Crash again!
116070 Heheheyeah! Rainbow... umm... eyah... Crash!
11600c Rarity! What're you doing talking to these guys?
11600d Oh, they were just admiring my wings, Rainbow Dash.
11606f Yeah, you should forget the sonic rainboom and just get yourself some wings like these!
116071 [laughs]
11600c Oohh...
11600e Uhh... C'mon, girls. Why don't we go see how clouds are made? Don't listen to them. You're gonna win that competition for sure!
11600c Are you kidding? I can't do the sonic rainboom, and just look at these boring, plain old feathered wings. I'm doomed!
116000 [group of workers awing at Rarity]
11600d What, these old things? Go ahead, everypony. Photos are encouraged.
116003 Rarity, we're supposed to be helping Rainbow Dash relax, remember? Put your wings away and stop showing off!
11600d Oh, pfft. How can you ask me to put away perfection?
116000 [workers awing]
11600d Waa-haa-haa!
116003 Rainbow Dash, are you okay? You don't look so good.
11600c [panting] Of course! Why wouldn't I be okay? Everyone's so in love with Rarity's wings that they won't even notice when I totally blow it in the Best Young Flyer's Competition.
11605a Hey! There's an idea! YOU should enter the competition!
116076 Yeah! I could watch you fly all day long!
11600d There really isn't anypony who uses their wings quite like me. Perhaps I should compete.
11600c WHAT?!
116000 [workers continue awing at Rarity]
11600c What am I gonna do?! I'll never win the competition now...
116000 [crowd cheering]
116000 [knocking]
11600d I'm going to be a while!
116007 [giggles]
116071 [laughs]
11600c [gulp]
116077 Fillies and gentlecolts! Please rise and join me in welcoming our beloved Princess Celestia!
116000 [fanfare and applause]
116077 Please welcome our celebrity judges for the Best Young Flyer Competition - the Wonderbolts!
116000 [crowd cheering]
116077 And now, let's find out who will take the prize as this year's best young flyer!
116078 Okay, contestant number one, you're up.
11600c Eyah!
116078 Okay, number two, let's go.
11600c Umm...
116078 C'mon, c'mon, we ain't got all day!
11600c She's talking to you!
116061 Oh. Umm... Oh, I guess that's me!
116078 Okay, number four, time to go.
11600d I'm number four, and I need just one more itsy-bitsy minute. Be a dear and have somepony go ahead of me, hmm?
116078 Look, I don't care who it is, but somepony's gotta go on!
116079 Let's do this!
11600c Uhh... What am I gonna do?
116003 I loved number seven. Doing fifteen barrel rolls in a row can't be easy.
11600e My favorite is number ten. She just looked like such a nice pony.
116008 Hmm... Wonder how come we haven't seen Rainbow Dash or Rarity yet. The competition's almost over.
116078 Number fifteen, let's go!
11600d Rarity... is ready!
116078 Look, ladies. I don't know what to tell you. There's only time for one more performance. If you both want to compete, you'll just have to go out there together!
11600d Well, Rainbow Dash? Shall we?
11600c [scared babbling]
116077 And now, for our final competitor of the day, contestant number fifteen! Uhh... And apparently contestant number four...
116000 [crowd cheering]
11600d Good luck, Rainbow Dash. Just do your best. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of changing our music. That "rock and roll" doesn't really match my wings.
116000 [classical music]
11600c [gulp] C'mon, Rainbow Dash. You can do this. Just remember the routine. Phase one.
116000 [crowd cheering]
11600c Oof. Waaah!
116070 Nice work, Rainbow Crash!
116071 [laugh]
11600c Time for phase two.
11600e Look! Phase two is working.
116000 [ponies cheering]
116019 [gasp]
11600d And now for my grand finale. I will fly right up to the sun and beam my beautiful wings over the whole city of Cloudsdale! Oh, they'll be talking about it for years!
11600c Looks like this is my last chance to turn things around. Phase three. The sonic [gulp] rainboom. Wings, don't fail me now!
116000 [crowd gasps]
11600c [grunt]
11600d [panting] Look upon me, Equestria, for I... am... Rarity!
116000 [crowd oohs]
11600d Uh-oh. [screams]
116003 Oh no! Her wings evaporated into thin air!
11600d [screams]
11607a Ooh!
11607b Aah!
11607c Uuh!
11600d [continues screaming]
11600c Hold on, Rarity! I'm coming!
11600d [more screaming]
11600e Oh, I can't look!
11600d [gasp]
11607d [gasp]
11600c [grunts]
11600e A sonic rainboom! She did it! She did it! Wooo!
11600c Whoa.
116000 [crowd cheering]
11600e A sonic rainboom! Wooo! Yeah!
11600c I did it. I did it!
11600d [sigh] You sure did. Oh thank you, Rainbow Dash. You saved my life!
11600c Oh yeah. I did that too. Ha, best day ever!
11600d I want to apologize to all of you for getting so carried away with my... beautiful wings. I guess I just lost my head.
11600e It's okay.
116008 Oh, don't worry about it, kiddo.
116007 We still love you.
11600d And I'm especially sorry that I was so thoughtless as to jump into the contest at the last minute after you had worked so hard to win it. Can you ever ever forgive me?
11600c Aw, it's okay. Everything turned out all right, right? I just wish I could have met the Wonderbolts when they were awake. [gasp] Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
11607c So you're the little pony who saved our lives. We really wanted to meet you and say thanks.
11600c Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
116003 Princess.
116019 Hello, Twilight Sparkle, and hello to your friends too.
11600d Princess Celestia, I am sorry I ruined the competition. Rainbow Dash here really is the best flyer in Equestria.
116019 I know she is, my dear. That's why, for her incredible act of bravery and her spectacular sonic rainboom, I'm presenting the grand prize for Best Young Flyer to this year's winner, Miss Rainbow Dash!
116000 [crowd cheers]
11600c Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
116019 So, Twilight Sparkle, did you learn anything about friendship from this experience?
116003 I did, Princess, but I think Rarity learned even more than me.
11600d I certainly did. I learned how important it is to keep your hooves on the ground, and be there for your friends.
116019 Excellent. Well done, Rarity.
11600c This really is the best day ever!
11606f Uhh, hey, Rainbow Crash.
116070 Dash!
11606f Oh! Uhh... Sorry. Rainbow Dash. Uhh, we just wanted to congratulate you on winning the competition.
116070 That sonic rainboom was awesome!
11600c Heh, thanks, guys.
11606f Uhh, we're really sorry we gave you such a hard time before.
11600c Aww, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
11606f Hey. Do you want to hang out with us? Maybe you could show us how you did that incredible trick!
11600c Sorry, boys... but I've got plans!
116000 [music]
116000 [credits]
11700d Where'd I put that? Ohh, I thought I already...
117000 [clatter]
11700d Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to... oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?
117066 Are you sure I can't help? I could—
11700d No!
117066 Maybe just a—
11700d No, thanks!
117066 How about—
11700d Just stand over there.
117066 But—
11700d Where you'll be out of the way. Ribbon, ribbon! Where's the ribbon?!
117066 I got it!
117000 [creaking]
117066 Whoa!
11700d [gasps]
117000 [clattering noises]
11700d Aah!
117000 [crashing]
117066 Um, I-I'll just go and stand over there, where I'll be... out of the way.
11700d [sigh]
117000 [theme song]
117066 Won't you at least let me help you clean up?
11700d No. You've helped me quite enough.
117066 I'm sorry, sis! I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift and finally earn my cutie mark.
11700d I understand. It's just that... I need this time to fill this order without any... complications. Okay, all done. Now, back to work. I've lost a lot of time, and I cannot have any more interruptions.
117000 [doorbell rings]
11700d Oh, what now?!
11700e Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign meant you were open, but I must have been mistaken.
11700d [gasps] Fluttershy! Forgive me! I was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!
11700e No worries, Rarity. I've left her there in the basket.
11706a [purrs]
11700d Oh, she looks great! I just don't understand how you're able to do it! I can't get near her without getting a swipe from her claws.
11706a [hisses]
11700d Ahh! Did you use... the Stare on her?
11700e Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't! I-I don't really have any control over when that happens. I-It just happens. No, I'm just good with animals. It's my special gift, you know?
11700d Well, you should have a picture of Opal as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.
117066 Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Maybe I can be good with animals, too!
117000 [swipe]
117066 Or not.
11707e [laughs]
11700d I'm sorry I can't invite you to stay and chat, Fluttershy. I've bitten off a bit more than I can chew with this order.
117066 But you're not eating anything.
11700d No, Sweetie, it's an expression. It means that I've taken on more work than I can handle. I've got twenty of these special robes to make tonight! They're due in Trottingham tomorrow morning.
11700e [gasp]
11700d See? I've lined them in a special gold silk. It took so long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
11700e These are lovely, but twenty by tonight? How will you get it all done?
11700d Well, I, uh...
117066 Oh, oh, oh! Maybe I could... just... just stand over here and watch.
11700d I'll manage.
11700e Well, maybe I should get out of your mane so you can work.
11707f Hi, Fluttershy! Hi, Rarity!
11700d Hello, uh, girls...
11707f Hey, Sweetie Belle!
117066 Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!
117065 You ready for tonight?
117066 Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!
11700a Tonight is the night we each try to find our own special talent.
117065 Even if it takes us all night!
11700a I'm ready! You ready?
117065 Very ready!
117080 Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's! Yay!
117066 And... look what I made us!
11707f Oh, wow! [laughter, gasps] That's so cool! Oooh!
11700e What does that patch on your cape mean?
117080 The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!
117065 We're on a crusade, a mission!
11700a To find our cutie marks!
117066 Yup. And look. I lined them with this special gold silk. It took sooo long to make, but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?
11707f Oooooh!
11700d Sweetie Belle! What have you done? That was the last of the gold silk! Oh, now I'll have to make more! Oh, I hope I can make more. I'm gonna have to work all night! Which means... Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusaders sleepover is cancelled.
117066 What?!
11700d I just won't have any time to watch you if I want to get these robes delivered on time.
117066 But—
11700d No buts this time. I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. It's just the way it has to be.
117080 Awwww...
11700e I, uh, I suppose I could take them for the night.
11700d I couldn't ask you to do that.
11700e Oh, it's no problem at all.
11700d Have you met my sister and her friends? A problem is all it would be.
11700e Did I have a problem with Opal? You've seen how well I handle small creatures!
11700d I suppose that's true... and I do have a lot of work to do...
11700e Come on, it'll be fun.
11700d I assure you, they're quite a handful.
11700e These sweet little angels?
11700d Well... all right.
117080 Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Fluttershy's cottage! Yay!
11700e So cute. W-wait for me!
11700d Hmmm...
11700e Oh, won't this be ever so fun? We can have a nice little tea party, and braid each others' tails, and sit quietly and color, and tell each other fairy tales, and—
117003 [grunt]
117080 [giggling]
117003 Hello, Fluttershy.
11700e Oh! Hello, Twilight. Where are you off to?
117003 I'm heading to the Everfree Forest to Zecora's to get some of my favorite tea.
11700e Th-The Everfree Forest? Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?
117003 Of course! How about you? What are you doing with the girls?
11700e Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.
117003 Wow. Sounds like everypony has their hooves full today. Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself? You sure you can handle it?
11700e What? These sweet little angels? They'll be no problem at all.
117000 [crickets chirping, owl hooting]
117000 [door closes]
117066 Wow! Look at this place! What's that? Are those chickens?
117080 [unintelligible chatter]
11700e [to herself] No... problem at all. [normal] Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?
117065 I'm gonna get my mark first!
11700e Girls?
117066 Nuh-uh!
11700e Should we—
11700a I am!
11700e Girls, okay, now settle—
117065 I'm staying up all night!
11700a Me, too!
117066 Me, three!
11700e I-I know you're excited, but— girls, oh, oh, careful with the— oh, ah, girls— [huffs] So! What do you wanna do? Play a game?
117065 We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
11700a And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!
117066 And, and, and we, um... yeah, what they said!
11700e Mmm, I don't know... How about a nice quiet little tea party?
117065 Or... we could go adventuring in the Everfree Forest!
117081 Yeah!
11700e Oh, no! The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous. It's filled with far too many strange creatures.
117066 But you could go with us and we could catch those creatures. We could be, umm... creature catchers!
117080 Yay! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!
117065 Arrrr! I am a dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!
117066 Halt, dangerous creature of the Everfree Forest. I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher, and I'm here to catch you!
117065 You can never catch me! I am far too powerful and dangerous!
117066 You cannot run from me!
117065 Raaaar!
117066 [giggling]
117065 Raaaar! [giggling]
11700e Um, oh, maybe that's not such a— now, girls, how about we do some nice coloring? Doh—
117066 Come back, dangerous creature, so I can catch you!
117065 Never!
11700e Careful... you don't...
117000 [crash]
11700e ...break anything.
117066 Sorry, Fluttershy.
117065 Yeah, sorry.
11700a I guess we aren't creature catchers.
11700e Oh, girls, it's okay. I—
11700a I know! We could be Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!
11700e C-carpenters?
11700a Hammer!
117065 Hammer.
117066 Hammer!
117065 Hammer. Hammer! ...Hammer.
117000 [various construction sounds]
117066 Um... that doesn't look like a table.
117065 We were making a table?
11700a Somepony needs to put this thing out of its misery.
117065 We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.
117066 Who wants a picture of a hammer on their flank anyway?
11700e Well, now that we've gotten that out of the way, how about a game?
11700a A game?
11700e It's called "Shhh!"
117065 What's that?
11700e Well, it's a game about who can be quiet the longest. Sound fun? I'm the world champ, you know. I bet you can't beat me! [squee] [deep breath]
117065 I lose!
117066 Me too!
11700a Me three!
11700e [sigh]
117065 Okay, now what can we do?
11700a Oh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?
117080 Yeah!
11700e No!
117080 Awwww!
11700e I mean, it's time for bed, don't you think? Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?
11700a Snuggly-wuggly? But we have more crusadin' to do!
117065 We've got plans!
117066 And capes!
11700e Um, okay, um... Maybe the crusading can wait until morning? When it's light? And not so... dark?
11700a How are we gonna find our special talent in our sleep?
11700e [puffs] Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream about your special talent.
117065 But we're not even tired!
11700e How about I sing you a lullaby?
117080 Mm-hmm, yeah!
11700e [clears throat]
11700e [Fluttershy]
11700e Hush now, quiet now
11700e It's time to lay your sleepy head
11700e Hush now, quiet now
11700e It's time to go to bed
117066 I know this one!
11700e Oh, how wonderful! Why don't you sing it with me?
117066 [clears throat]
117066 [Sweetie Belle]
117066 Hush now! Quiet now!
117066 It's time to lay your sleepy head!
117066 Said hush now! Quiet now!
117066 It's time to go to bed!
11700e Okay Sweetie, that was...
117066 [Sweetie Belle]
117066 Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
117066 The exciting day behind you!
117066 Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
117066 Let the joy of dream land find you!
11700e Thank you Sweetie, um...
117066 [Sweetie Belle]
117066 Hush now! Quiet now!
117066 Lay your sleepy head!
117066 Said hush now! Quiet now!
117066 It's time to go to bed!
117066 Ow!
117000 [chickens clucking and flapping]
117065 What is that?
11700e [gasp] Girls!
11700a Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!
117066 I wonder what could have caused that...
117065 Don't worry, Fluttershy, the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!
117066 Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders! Yay!
11700e No, I don't think that's a— ah, come back! Please!
117080 [calling chickens]
117000 [chickens squawking]
11700e Come on, girls, the chickens are fine— oh, girls, um... girls!
117000 [chickens flapping and clucking]
11700e Come on, in you go.
117000 [eerie music]
11700e There's some good chickens. Okay, you three. Isn't it about time you got into bed?
117080 But—
11700e Please?
11700e So, no more crusading for tonight, all right?
117065 Yes, Fluttershy!
117066 We promise, Fluttershy!
11700a Good night, Fluttershy!
11700e Okay, good night.
117066 Okay, so what kind of crusading do we do next?
11700a There's not much we can do from this room... unless we become Cutie Mark Crusader cottage cleaners.
117066 N-no, thanks.
11700a Well, we have to think of somethin'. We can't just waste this opportunity to find out what our special talents are. Hey, girls! Look! Some of the chickens may have escaped!
117066 Into the forest!
117080 [whispering] Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!
11700e [sigh] It really wasn't that hard ... I mean, all I needed to do was just show them who's in charge. Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy! Good with animals, good with kids.
117000 [tearing fabric]
117065 [whispering] Wait up!
11700e Mmm, peace and quiet. [gasps] Too quiet. [gasps] Girls? Girls? Elizabeak! She's missing! Girls?! [gasps] Oh, no! They must have gone looking for my missing chicken! Which means... they must have gone into... [gasp] [gulp] The Everfree Forest!
11700e Those girls have really done it this time! They've really bitten off more than they can chew! Oh, just like me! I never should have offered to watch them. [deep breath]
11700a Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! Brawck, bawk-bawk-bawk, brawck!
117065 What are you doing?
11700a Callin' for the chicken!
117065 That is not how you call a chicken.
11700a Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?
117065 I know that's not the way.
11700a Then show me.
117065 I don't have to show you!
11700a You're just chicken!
117065 Am not!
11700a Oh, wait, now I know how to call a chicken! Scootaloo! Scoot-scootalooooo!
117065 That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
11700a You also forgot how to call a chicken!
117065 Why, you...
11700a [blows raspberry]
117066 Come on, guys, we're not gonna find the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.
11700a Maybe that's our special talent. Arguin'!
117065 Is not!
11700a Is too!
117065 Is not!
11700a Is too! Anything yet?
117065 Nope.
11700a Darn.
11707f [giggle]
117000 [wind blows]
11700a Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick, baaawk, bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk-bawk, b-baaaaawk!
11700e [whispering] Girls? [gulp] Girls? [squeak] Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy. Just put one hoof in front of the other.
117000 [twig snaps]
11700e Ahh! What was that?
117000 [thump]
11700e [scream] Twilight? I-Is that you? Oh, Twilight, it is you. Thank goodness you're here. I need your help. The girls are out here somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're— [gasps] Oh! What's happened to you? [scream]
117000 [thud]
11700e Oh, no! If you've been turned to stone, it must mean— oh! Oh no, the girls! Don't move. I'll be back for you. Girls!
117065 Is not!
11700a Is too!
117065 Is not!
11700a Is too!
117066 Girls! Our special talent is not arguing. Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony whose talent is arguing even look like?
11700e Girls? Girls?
117066 Fluttershy?
11700e Girls! Thank goodness I found you!
11700a Fluttershy, what—
11700e Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!
117066 But... we haven't found the chicken yet!
11700e There's no time for that. There's a cockatrice on the loose!
11700a A cocka-what now?
11700e A cockatrice! It's a frightening creature with the head of a chicken and the body of a snake. Now, come on!
117065 The head of a chicken and the body of a snake? That doesn't sound scary, that sounds silly!
11700a Why, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was.
11700e No! Never look one in the eye!
117000 [chicken clucking]
11700e If you look a cockatrice in the eye—
11700a The chicken!
11700e Girls! Wait!
117080 Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!
117000 [chicken clucking]
117000 [growling]
117066 There he is!
117065 Two chickens?
11700a I thought only one escaped!
117066 Grab them both!
117000 [chicken clucking]
117082 [roar]
117000 [chicken clucking]
117000 [thud]
117080 [scream]
117000 [thump]
117080 [gasp]
11700e See? Now we have to—
117080 [screaming]
11700e Girls, please. Girls— now listen to me, girls, I— please!
117000 [screaming]
117082 [squawking]
11700e Girls! Behind me, now!
117082 [squawking and roaring]
11700e You! Just who do you think you are, going around turning others into stone?
117082 [dismayed squawk]
11700e You should be ashamed of yourself! I have a mind to find your mother and tell her what you've been up to, young man! Now you go over there and turn Elizabeak and my friend Twilight back to normal, and don't ever let me catch you doing this again! Do you understand me?
117082 [dismayed squawking]
11700e Are you girls all right? I was so worried!
117065 Yeah, fine!
117066 Thanks to that stare of yours.
117065 You're like the queen of stares. You're the—
117080 Stare Master!
117066 We're sorry we snuck out of the house and into the forest.
11700a Yeah. We'll listen to you from now on.
117065 We promise.
11700e Oh, you do, do you? Well, you better, or I'll give you... the Stare!
117083 [giggling]
117003 What... what happened?
117000 [chicken squawking]
117080 [giggling]
11700e And that's when it brought you back from stone.
117003 This is gonna make quite a letter to the princess. I was wrong about you. You certainly do know how to handle those girls.
11700e Oh, I wouldn't go that far.
117003 Hmm? How so?
11700e I assumed that I'd be just as good with kids as I am with animals. Boy, was I wrong. I really learned the hard way not to bite off more than I could chew.
117003 You and Rarity both. Good morning, Rarity.
11700e Did you finish all those capes?
11700d [sigh] Just delivered them. I have to admit, if you hadn't come along, I might not have. Thanks again.
11700e Won't you stay for some tea?
11700d I really must get back to the shop and clean up. Girls! Get your things. Time to go. Girls!
117080 [giggling, talking]
11700d Girls! Time to— Girls! Your things! Girls! It's time to— Girls!
11700e Allow me. [clears throat] Girls?
11700a Yes, Fluttershy?
117065 You called?
11700e Go and get your things. Rarity is here to see you home.
117066 Of course, Fluttershy, right away!
11700d Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?
11700e I guess I'm just as good with kids as I am with animals.
117080 Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you, Stare Master!
11700d Ah, uh, speaking of which, I could use your help with Opal.
11700e Of course. How about later today?
11706a [yowls]
11700d How about now? [strains]
11706a [yowls]
117084 [giggling]
117000 [music]
117000 [credits]
11800a Where are you takin' us?
118008 We're almost there, young'uns.
118066 I've never been here before.
118065 Ouch!
11800a Oh. Sorry.
118065 Are we there yet?
118066 There? Where? What? I don't even know what we're doing.
118008 Here we are.
11800a What are we lookin' at?
118065 I have no idea.
118066 What is that thing?
118008 Cutie Mark Crusaders, welcome to your new clubhouse! Well, don't thank me all at once. This was my clubhouse when I was your age. Sure it hasn't been used in a while, but it's empty and on a secluded, private part of the farm. And it's all yours. It just needs a little, uh... TLC.
118065 TLC as in Tender Loving Care or Totally Lost Cause?
11800a Applejack, we're supposed to turn this into our new clubhouse?!
118008 Well, maybe y'all will get your cutie marks when you discover your talent for— [yelp] Uh... house cleanin'?
118000 [theme song]
118000 [birds chirping]
118000 [motor revving]
118000 [ponies gasp]
118009 Soup's on!
11800a Whoa! Hey, Scootaloo! Back already? You're amazin' on that scooter.
118065 Thanks! Wow, Apple Bloom. You did all of this?
11800a Yep! I've fixed the broken shutters, sanded off the splinters, rebuilt the roof, painted...
118065 That's so cool. What's Sweetie Belle up to?
118066 [Sweetie Belle]
118066 We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders... [humming]
118066 ...Never stop the journey... [humming]
11800a There you are, Sweetie Belle! See? I told you we could find her by following her totally awesome voice.
118065 What's that sweet tune you're singing?
118066 Oh. I was just working on our new Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song.
11807f Cool!
118065 Teach us?
118066 Well, I've only come up with one part... but okay!
118066 [Sweetie Belle]
118066 They all say that you will get your mark
118066 When the time is really right
11800a [Apple Bloom]
11800a And you know just what you're supposed to do
118065 [Scootaloo]
118000 [loud and off-key] And your talent comes to light!
118008 Well, uh... I'll be, Cutie Mark Crusaders. You've done one fine job with this place. So, what's next?
11800a Well, now that we have a real life clubhouse...
118065 ...and a map of Ponyville...
118066 ...and a Cutie Mark Crusaders theme song...
118008 Theme song?
11800a We're gonna go out in the world and discover our talents.
118065 A new adventure!
118066 And earn our cutie marks.
11800a We'll leave no stone unturned!
118065 No mountain unclimbed!
118066 No meal uncooked!
11800a No sock unworn!
118008 Well okay then! Sounds like you have a plan. I gotta, uh... leave no apple unpicked! See y'all later!
118065 Are we ready to get our cutie marks, ponies?
118080 Ready!
118000 [bell ringing]
118000 [pigs squealing]
118066 [sniffs]
118000 [machine whirring]
118000 [bell ringing]
118085 [crying]
118000 [dings]
118000 [cards flicking]
118000 [wind whistling]
118000 [bubble sounds]
118000 [octopus growling]
118005 I had nothing to do with this.
118003 What is going on here?
11800a Hmm... Well, we sure aren't gettin' our cutie marks for bein' librarians.
118005 Huh. I should think not. What?
118003 Girls, I think you're going about this the wrong way. Instead of trying to do things in areas you're not familiar with, why not try doing things in areas that you already like?
11805b And I have the perfect place to start.
11800a "Showcase your talents..."
118065 "...for all to see."
118066 "Perform in the Ponyville school talent show!"
11805b There'll be all sorts of awards. Best dramatic performance, best comedy act, best magic act... surely you can find your talent.
11800a This would be the perfect place to discover our talents. Jugglin'!
118065 Acting!
118066 Magic tricks!
11800a Square dancin'!
118065 Tightrope walking!
118066 Tiger taming!
118003 My little ponies! You're missing the point. Think about the things you already enjoy doing. Think about what you're already good at.
118065 Sure! We can do that.
118066 Yeah! Sure we can.
11800a Well, whatever we do, we'll do it as...
118080 ...the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
11800d Sweetie Belle! I told you not to touch my things. Come back with my supplies!
118066 We're just borrowing them for the talent show. Don't worry, sis. I promise we'll bring them back.
118065 Thanks, Mr Breezy. We'll return the fan to you real soon.
11800a What do we need this fan for?
118066 Trust me on this one.
118065 Okay, so that's six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. Anything else?
118066 Yeah. Instructions on how to use six wooden planks, four-by-eight plywood, a box of nails, four cans of paint, and four brushes. Woah!
118003 "Ghosts, Goblins and Ghoulish Figures"? Good heavens, girls. What do you need a book like this for?
118065 You'll see. Thanks, Twilight. We'll give it back as soon as we're done with it.
118003 What do you think they're up to?
118005 I have no idea and I don't know if I should be excited or scared to find out.
11800a I'm glad we're doin' this as a team.
118066 Me too. Um... so what are we doing again?
118065 A super awesome dramatic song for the talent show, of course.
118066 Right! With super-cool scenery. And amazing costumes!
11800a And mind-blowin' dance moves.
118065 This is gonna be soo amazing!
11800a Sweetie Belle, I think you should be a singer.
118066 What? No way I'm singing in front of a crowd. Twilight said to do something we like to do, and... I'd like to be like my big sister, and she's a designer.
118065 Fine then. You can do the costumes and the scenery.
11800a And Scootaloo, you're great in maneuvers on your scooter. So you should do the choreography. Y'know, all those dance moves.
118065 Nah. I'd rather sing a wicked rock ballad. Why don't you come up with the dance routine, Apple Bloom?
11800a Hm... I'm not much of a dancer... but I do like Kung-fu. That's kinda like dancin'. Hi-ya! Hah! Hah! Yah!
118066 Then it's settled! Let's get started.
11800a One... two... three... oh! Oh!
118065 Ow, Apple Bloom! What are you doing?
11800a Oh, I feel like I have four left feet. I can't even spin right.
118065 Don't be silly. You just gotta keep your head forward until the very last minute, like this. See? Easy-peasy. You just gotta practice a bunch, that's all.
11800a Wow! That does look easy. Thanks. Okay. Let's try this again. Oh! Ouch! Ow. I'm okay!
118065 Keep practicing!
11800a Will do.
118000 [discordant piano notes]
118065 We fight the fight, walk the walk. Talk the talk, eat the... uh... food like a celery stalk? Ugh! I'll never come up with anything! Never, never, never!
118066 Come back! Come back! Uh. Dumb fabric. Hey, Scoot! How's the song going?
118065 Pbbbt.
118066 Pbbbt? Oh my! Sounds serious.
118065 I'm just no good at lyrics. Coming up with words is, like... really hard.
118066 Oh, it can't be that bad. "With our cutie marks we'll rock Equestria. We use our stomachs to... digestia"? Umm... well... these are... um... good, but... how about after "we fight the fight"...
118066 There is nothing that we fear
118066 We'll have to figure out what we'll do next
118066 'Til our cutie marks are here
118065 Wow! That's so awesome! Did you just come up with that now?
118066 Yeah... kind of.
118065 Thanks, I'm totally using that.
118066 Oh no!
118000 [sewing machine whirring]
118066 One, two, three, four, five? [moan] [sigh]
11800a Ouch!
118066 How's the spin coming along?
11800a I think I gotta just stick to punches and kicks. You know, ponies only have four legs.
118066 [moan] I'll never be a designer like my sister Rarity.
11800a Hey, it's no big deal. Why don't you use the dress form? It'll help you with your patterns and help you put all the pieces in the right places.
118066 Oh, is that what that's for?
11800a Uh... maybe you should also clean your paintbrush between each color.
118066 Oh, I was wondering why all the colors looked like mud.
11800a You're not using power tools, are you?
118008 The talent show is just around the corner. I wonder how the fillies are doin'.
11800a Oh! Sorry, Scootaloo.
118065 That's okay. Ugh!
118066 Oops! Sorry, Scootaloo. Ouch!
118065 Oh, my bad, Sweetie Belle. Let's sing the chorus again!
118008 Well, gosh. Sure wasn't expectin' that.
11800a I think that sounded pretty good.
118066 Me too. You think we're ready?
118065 Ready as we'll ever be. Hey! Did you see us practicing?
118008 Uh... yeah.
11800a Well? How'd we do? How'd we do?
118008 Uh...
118065 Speechless! See, girls? I told you that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna leave them speechless.
118080 Yay!
118008 "Speechless" is right.
118000 [crowd chattering]
118036 ...And, on the count of three, this rabbit will disappear, and something tasty will reappear in its place. One, a two, and a three! Hey! Where are they? Snails, where are the... carrots.
118000 [crowd laughing]
118036 SNAILS!
11805b Uh, how about a round of applause for the S&S magic act? And now for our next act, we have Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie reciting their favorite poem... on roller skates!
118066 Break a leg!
11800a Sweetie Belle! What a thing to say!
118066 No, no, no. You see, in the theater it's considered bad luck to say "good luck". So you say "break a leg" instead.
118003 My little ponies! How are you doing?
118080 Nervous...
118003 Don't worry. You're gonna be amazing. Remember, just stick to what you know best. I can't wait to hear you sing, Sweetie Belle.
118066 Why does everypony always think I'm gonna sing?
118065 Actually, Twilight Sparkle, I'm the main singer tonight.
118003 Oh?
11800a And I'm the main dancer. Hi-ya!
118003 Oh?
118066 And I'm in charge of...
118003 Costumes?
118066 And sets and props. How'd you know?
118003 Really, girls? Are you sure...?
11805b Cutie Mark Crusaders, you're on next. Break a leg.
118003 Break a le—
11800a Ugh!
118003 Uh... good luck!
118065 [Scootaloo]
118065 Look, here, are three little ponies,
118065 Ready to sing for this crowd,
118065 Listen up, 'cause here's our story
118065 I'm gonna sing it
118080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
118080 Very loud!
118065 [Scootaloo]
118065 When you're a younger pony
118065 And your flank is very bare
118065 Feels like the sun will never come
118065 When your cutie mark's not there
118065 So the three of us will fight the fight
118065 There is nothing that we fear
118065 We'll have to figure out what we'll do next
118080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
118080 'Til our cutie marks are here!
118080 We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
118080 On a quest to find out who we are
118080 And we will never stop the journey
118080 Not until we have our cutie marks
118065 [Scootaloo]
118065 They all say that you'll get your mark
118065 When the time is really right
118065 And you know just what you're supposed to do
118065 And your talent comes to light
118065 But it's not as easy as it sounds
118065 And that waiting's hard to do
118065 So we test our talents everywhere
118080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
118080 Until our face is blue
118080 We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
118080 On a quest to find out who we are
118080 And we will never stop the journey
118080 Not until we have our cutie marks
118080 We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
118080 On a quest to find out who we are
118080 And we will never stop the journey
118080 Not until we have our cutie marks!
118000 [crash]
118000 [laughter]
118065 Wow. That did not go as well as I expected.
11800a I can't believe they're laughin' at us.
118066 Was it that bad?
11805b Back on stage, girls. It's time for the awards.
118066 Back on stage? No.
11800a They'll just laugh some more.
118065 Yeah, what's the point?
11805b Now girls, let's be good sports. You made a great effort. You should be proud. Now come on! [to the crowd] Let's hear it for all our talented fillies and colts.
118000 [hooves stomping]
11805b Our first award goes to... Snips and Snails for best magic act.
118036 Hey! Mine's at least shinier.
118035 Well, mine's bigger.
118036 Oh yeah, well... well, mine is, um... heavier?
11805b The next award goes to... Sunny Daze and Peachy Pie for best dramatic performance.
118086 [gasp]
11805b And finally, the last award of the night goes to... the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
118080 What?
11805b For best comedy act.
118000 [ponies cheering]
11800a Can you believe it? We won!
118065 I knew our act was awesome.
118066 You know what would be the best? If we won and we got our cutie marks.
118080 [moan]
118003 Congratulations, ponies! Job well done.
118080 [sadly] Thanks, Twilight.
118003 Hey, you don't sound too excited.
118065 [sigh] We worked really hard and won a prize, but we still don't have our cutie marks.
118066 Which is the prize we really wanted.
118003 Oh, girls...
11800a But we think we know why.
118066 Yes. We know why.
118003 Oh? Tell me. I'd love to make a special report to the Princess.
118066 Well, maybe we were trying too hard.
118003 Yes? And?
118065 And instead of forcing ourselves to do something that's not meant for us...
118003 Yes? Yes?
11800a We each should be embracing our true talent!
118003 And that is...?
118080 Comedy!
118008 Apple Bloom! You did it!
118080 Did you see our award? Weren't we funny?
118003 One day... [giggle] one day...
118000 [music]
118000 [credits]
11900d Perfect!
119000 [doorbell ringing]
11900d Coming! Welcome to Carousel Boutique, where every garment is chic, unique, and magnifique. [gasp] Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop!
119089 Good afternoon, Miss Rarity!
11900d You yah... y-y-you know my name?
119089 Well, of course I do, darling. I make it a point to know all of the up-and-coming designers and Clothes Horse magazine simply raved about you.
11900d Oh my stars. If I'm dreaming, do not wake me up. How may I help you, Miss Shores?
119089 Oh please, call me Sapphire.
11900d [giggle] How may I help you, Sapphire?
119089 Well, as I'm sure you know, I'll be touring all of Equestria with my latest concert, Sapphire Shores' Ziegfilly Follies, so I need to look seeensational! Ow!
11900d I have just what you need. Sapphire Shores, prepare yourself for the pièce de résistance de la haute couture. I used every last diamond I found on this one garment.
119089 [gasp] And it is spectacular! I'll take it.
11900d Really?
119089 Oh yes, and five more, each done up in a different jewel.
11900d Beg pardon?
119089 Costume changes.
11900d [faints]
119089 [chuckle] Yes, I do have that effect on ponies.
119000 [theme song]
119005 Oh my gosh! Sapphire Shores! The pony of pop! She is awesome! I mean, she's gorgeous and talented and — heh... and not even half the pony you are. I mean, you're ten times more gorgeous and talented and—
11900d Spike, a lady is never jealous.
119005 Eh, of course not. But were you totally flipping out or what?!
11900d Ladies do not "flip out", Spike. However, I was quite in awe. Oh, I need to find more jewels than ever before to decorate her costumes. Oh, aha!
119005 Did you find some?
11900d Yes, Spike! Right there!
119005 Ooooo! You look so delicious...
11900d Spike! I promised I'd give you gems to snack on, but we need to collect more first or I'll never be able to make these outfits for Sapphire.
119005 Hm... I will miss you, my sweets.
11900d Come along, Spike. We have many jewels to find.
119005 At your service, milady.
11900d Spike!
119000 [jackhammer sounds]
119005 [licks lips]
11900d You've been very patient today, Spike, and for that you get the finest reward. This is from me to you. Is something wrong, Spike?
119005 No. It's perfect.
11900d Ooo, bring the cart, Spike. There are more over here.
119005 For me. From Rarity.
11908a Yesss, gemsss. Gemsss!
11908b Where?
11908a Preciousss gemsss! He is the gem hunter. With him we can have all those gems... and more! Let's get the dragon.
11900d Spike! Where are you?
11908a Wait! Who is that?
11900d You know, it's terrible to keep a lady waiting.
119005 Coming!
11900d I think we're really going to strike gold this time. So to speak. [laugh]
119005 Jackpot!
11908a Oh, it's not the dragon we want. It's the pony!
11908c The pony...
11900d Well, Spike, I think that's all we can do for today. And these will certainly get me well on my way with Sapphire's outfits. Why don't we start headi... oh! What's this? Another jewel. Oh... oh, strange. It's in the trees. Oooo— eww! Uh... uh... good day, gentle... uh, fellow. Uh, I am Rarity and this is my friend Spike.
119005 Ehe...
11900d And you are...
11908a A Diamond Dog.
11900d Oh really? Oh well, that explains your fine taste in jewelry. I mean I-I-I know that diamonds are a girl's best friend and now I know that they're a dog's best friend too, ha ha ha. So, um, [cough] you're out hunting for gems as well?
11908a Yes. We hunt.
11900d Uh... we?
11908a We hunt for gems. But you are a better hunter. So now we hunt... for you!
11900d [screams]
119005 [jackhammers] [babbles]
11908d Yaaaaah!
11908b [growls]
119005 [grunt] Run, Rarity! Run! Aaaah! Uh!
11908b Ooooooh!
11908d Yaaaaah!
11900d Spike! Come on! Hurry!
11908a Gotcha!
11900d Waah! Spike!
119005 Got him, Rarity! I got him!
11908b Haha! Nope!
11908d Sorry, scaly one.
119005 Wait! Rarity?
11900d Unhand me this instant, you ruffians. Stop! Put me down, you thugs! You brutes!
119005 [gasp] Rarity!
11900d Spike! Ah, dirt! [shrieks] Spike!
119005 Which, what, where?
11900d Save me...!
119005 Nooooooooooo!
119003 Spike, can you breathe now?
119005 Yes... [pant] I think so.
119003 Good. Now tell us what you know.
11900c Yeah. 'Cause all you said earlier was...
119005 [pant] Aaaah! Rarity... woods... jewels... dogs... hole... taken... Save her!
119008 Not a whole lot to go on there, sport.
119005 Sorry. Rarity and I were in the woods looking for jewels when these creepy guys showed up.
119003 Creepy guys?
119005 They called themselves the Diamond Dogs. They grabbed Rarity and disappeared down a hole in the ground.
119008 Well, this sounds mighty easy. Just take us to that there hole and we'll save Rarity.
11906c [gasp]
119007 Holy moly, that's a lotta holeys.
119003 Come on, girls! Let's get started. Hello?
11908b [growl]
119003 [gasp] Puh!
11900c Yuck! Ugh!
119007 [squeal]
119005 Puh!
119003 Quick! We gotta get down one before they're all filled up.
11900e Oh! Oh my. Oh, oh!
119008 We can't muscle through it!
11900c We'll see about that. [gasp]
119008 Whew. Heavens to Betsy. Now I'm used to pickin' myself up and dustin' myself off, but Rarity won't even touch mud 'less it's imported.
119003 Oh, Rarity...
11900d Oh, woe is me! Whatever shall I do? Ah! Dirt, dirt! Get away, dirt! Oh! Make it stop, make it stop! Ah! Filthy, disgusting dirt. It stings, it burns. Help! Oh, somepony save me, save me!
119008 We gotta save her.
11900e But they blocked up all the holes.
119008 Don't mean we can't dig 'em out. Come on!
119007 Ow!
11900e Oof!
119005 [panting] Whoa! Oof!
11900c Get 'em!
119008 [grunting] [gasp]
119007 Whoooaaa!
11900c Come on!
11906c [grunting and panting]
11900e All those scary monsters popping up everywhere. Oh, poor Rarity must be terrified.
119003 [worryingly] Ooh.
11908d Give me the baubles!
11900d Ah!
11908b Give me the beads!
11900d Aah!
11908a Where are the trinkets?!
11900d Aaaah!
11908c Where is the treasure?!
11900d [faints]
119003 Poor Rarity. What are we gonna do?
119005 I got it! I'll save you, my sweet.
11906c Huh?
119003 Spike, it is very noble of you...
119005 Shhh!
119003 [quieter] ...to sacrifice the gem Rarity gave you.
119005 Oh, Lady Rarity. My damsel in distress.
11908e I shall save you. Show yourselves, you dogs! You curs! Ah. There you are, you mangy mutts.
11908a Who are you calling mutts? Unleash the hounds! [blows dog whistle]
11908f [barking] [yelping]
11908e Now, where is Lady Rarity?
119090 [gasp] Spike! I knew you would save me!
11908e Nothing could stop me, milady.
119090 Ohohohoh, Spike. You are my... hero. [smooch]
11908e Mmmmmm...
119008 Hoho there, lover boy.
119005 Whoa! Whoa whoa whoawhoawhoa... I got a bite! I got a bite!
119008 Hold on there, little fella.
119003 Applejack!
11900c Twilight!
11900e Oh my goodness, oh my goodness...
119007 Wait for me!
11900e Oh!
119007 Whee!
119005 [yelps]
11906c [yelping]
119005 [yelps]
11906c [yelping]
119007 Whee! Ha, ha, ha!
119005 Oh, oh!
119000 [ponies grunting]
119005 Ha ha, it worked! We're in! Now we can finally save Rarity!
119003 Um... which way do we go?
119005 Nooooooooooo!
119003 All these tunnels... how are we ever gonna find Rarity?
119008 Guess we're just gonna have to start going down them one by one.
11900c That could take forever! There's gotta be way to narrow it down.
119005 I know! I bet they've taken Rarity down the tunnel with the most gems.
119003 But Spike, Rarity is the only one who knows how to find gems.
119005 No, Twilight. You can! You can copy Rarity's gem-finding spell.
119003 Oh my gosh! You're right! Rarity showed me how she did it a while back. If I can just remember...
119005 That's it. You did it, Twilight! Come on! We're coming, Rarity. We'll save you. Just hold on.
11900d Oh please, Diamond Dogs. Please let me go.
11908d No!
11908b You're our precious little pony.
11908a Forever! Muhahahaha!
11900d But whatever do you want from me?
11908a Gemsss!
11908d Yes! The gems. The jewels.
11908b Find them! Find them all!
11900d Oh! Is that all? There. A lovely pocket of jewels are right there. Now, if you'd be so kind as to show me the exit?
11908a Good! [laugh] Now, dig them up, pony.
11900d What? But you said you wanted me to find the gems.
11908d Yes! Find and then dig.
11900d Dig?
11908b Yes. Dig.
11900d Ohh... [grunting]
11908b What are you doing? We said dig!
11900d Forgive me, but prior to you so rudely dragging me into your dirt pit, I had a pony-pedi and I am not about to chip a hoof because you dislike my style of digging. [grunting]
11908a Oh, for goodness— Fine! Just stop. Stop! Dig, dogs! Dig! And fast.
11908f [barking]
11908b She won't dig, she pulls.
11900d I beg your pardon, but what, pray tell, are you doing?
11908b Others will dig. You will haul the wagon.
11908d Prrrecious pony-pedi will be preserved.
11900d Well, somebody certainly needs proper nail care. When was the last time you two had a manicure? You're scratching up my coat with those jagged things!
11908a Please be quiet!
11900d Good heavens, what is that smell?
11908a Smeeeeeell?
11900d Ah, mystery solved. It's your breath.
11908a Enough! Search, pony!
11900d Well, since you insist... but I must say the working conditions in here are simply dreadful. Musty and damp, it's going to wreak havoc on my mane. And this air is stifling, suffocating. And when I try to take a deep breath, the stench of all you dogs makes me nauseated.
119000 [crash]
11900d You look and smell like you haven't bathed in weeks. Have you never heard of soap? You could all do with a good round of soap and water. Oh water, oh water, I'm terribly thirsty. Could I please have some water?
11908d Good gracious, I can't take this anymore. Be quiet, pony!
11900d And that's another thing. I would appreciate if you stopped calling me "pony". I am a lady and I wish to be addressed as such. So you may call me "Miss" or "Rarity" or "Miss Rarity".
11908a Enough! Your whining! It-it-it hurts!
11900d Whining? I am not whining. I am complaining. Do you want to hear whining? Thiiis iiis whiiining! Oooh, this harness is too tiiight! It's going to chafe. Can't you loosen it? Oooh, it hurts and it's sooo ruuusty! Why didn't you clean it first? It's gonna leave a staaain! And the wagon's getting heeeavy, why do I have to pull it?!
11908d Aaah! Make it stop!
11908a Stop whining!
11900d But I thought you wanted whiiining!
11908a Geh! We'll do anything, pony!
11900d [huffs]
11908a Oh, uh... uh, we'll do anything, "Miss Rarity". [nervous laughter]
11900d Anything?
11900d [sigh] This water is hardly sparkling. But I suppose it will have to do.
11908a [panting] Wait! Why are we doing this?
11908d To stop the awful noises from the pony's mouth, remember? [whines]
11908a Yes, yes, I know. This is ridiculous! Letting a pony order us around. What are we? Mice or dogs?
119091 Mi... dogs?
11908a Dogs do not pull. Ponies pull. Let her make the awful noises.
11900d What are you doing? Hey, you spilled my drink. Oh! [whining] Not sooo tiiight!
11908a Ha! Make the noises all you want. But move while you make them. Hyah, mule!
11900d Did you just call me a... mule?
11908a Ehh...
11900d Mules are ugly. Are you saying that I too am ugly? [cries]
11908d What are these noises?
11900d He called me ugly!
11908a No! Mule! I said mule!
11900d An old ugly mule! And it's true! Just look at me. I used to be beautiful, but, but nooow...
11908b No, no! You're still beautiful, po... uh, Miss Rarity.
11900d You're just saying that!
11908d No, you're still pretty and... and...
11908a Oh, uh, uh, nice. Yeah.
11900d I don't believe you! You never liked me! [wails]
11908a Oh, I've had just about enough of this!
119003 We're getting close. I can feel it.
11900d [distant crying]
119005 It's coming from down here. Come on!
11900c She must be in there. Let's go!
119092 More workhorses.
119008 Ho, doggies. If you can take this bull by the horns, you better be ready for a ride. Come on, ponies! Kick 'em up, kick 'em out! Buck 'em up, buck 'em down!
11908f [yowling]
119008 Yeehaw! Get along, little doggies!
119000 [crashing and clattering]
119005 I'm coming for you, milady. Hi-ho, Twilight! Away!
119003 And just what do you think you're doing?
119005 Please, Twilight. Just give me this.
119003 Eh... fine. [neighs]
119000 [crash]
119005 Lady Rarity, I'm here to save you!
11908c [Save us! Please, save us! Make it stop! Please!]
119003 Excuse me?
11908d So picky.
11908b And critical.
11908d She won't stop talking.
11908b And crying.
11908a We, uh, give her back. Yes.
119005 Rarity! You're safe!
11900d Why, yes. Hello, girls. You arrived just in time to assist me.
119008 Assist you with what?
11900d With those.
119005 You're letting her leave with all these... jewels?
11908a Yes. Take them. And her with them.
11908d Please!
119007 I can't believe you found all these gems!
11900c Heh. I can't believe you tricked all those dogs.
11900d Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I cannot handle myself in a sticky situation. I had them wrapped around my hoof the entire time.
119003 I can't wait to write to Princess Celestia to tell her what you taught me today.
11900d Me? What did I teach you?
119003 Just because somepony is ladylike doesn't make her weak. In fact, by using her wits, a seemingly defenseless pony can be the one who outsmarts and outshines them all.
119005 Hm... "outshines" is right. Now you have enough gems to cover Sapphire Shores' costumes.
11900d Not if you eat them all, Spike.
119000 [laughter]
119000 [music]
119000 [credits]
12000d So sorry, Fluttershy. I hate being late for our weekly get-together. The usual!
120000 [steam hisses]
12000d But you will not believe what happened to me.
12000e Is everything all right?
12000d Oh, it's much more than all right. I was on my way here, wearing my latest hat creation, when who should stop me on the street but Photo Finish!?
12000e Photo Finish?
120000 [steam hisses]
12000d She is the most famous fashion photographer in all of Equestria. Anywho, she saw my hat and said it was absolutely marvelous!
12000e What a lovely compliment.
12000d She was so impressed that she wants to take some pictures of my shop featuring some of my clothes!
12000e [squee] That's wonderful.
12000d [vibrating] Do you know what this could mean for my fashion career?
12000e Oh, Rarity, I'm so happy for you.
12000d But I'm going to need somepony fabulous to model for me. Somepony with beauty. Somepony with grace. Somepony... like you?
12000e Oh, goodness. I don't know.
12000d Oh, this is such a huge opportunity. And it would mean so much to me.
12000e I'm flattered, really.
12000d Nopony is going to have your elegance and poise.
12000e But...
12000d Nopony!
12000e There has to be somepony more quali-
12000d Please!
12000e Somepony more into fashion.
12000d Please!
12000e Somepony more comfortable in the spotlight.
12000d Please, please, pleeease!
12000e Oh, if it's that important to you, of course I'll do it.
12000d Oh, thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou! You are the best friend a pony could ever have!
12000e [sigh] What a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
12000d Isn't it? Though I was so afraid you wouldn't agree to model for me that I felt completely frazzled. I think I feel a pimple coming on. Oh! Only one solution! The usual!
120000 [theme song]
12000d Hm... She's going to want to see attitude and pizzazz.
12000e A-a-attitude and, um... pizzazz.
12000d More light! It has to catch the sequins just so or the whole outfit is just a disaster. Oh, and the headdress needs more feathers. Pinkie Pie! More feathers! And sequins! More sequins!
12000e [whimper]
12000d And more ribbon! Oh no! Less ribbon. No! More ribbon.
12000e [squeal]
12000d Oh, this hem is completely off. Pincushion! Thank you all for helping me. I'm sorry to be so short with you, but I'm... I'm just so nervous.
120003 Oh, doesn't that hurt?
120005 Thick scales. Can't feel a thing. And even if I could, there is no pain that would keep me from assisting the most beautiful creature in the world. I'm gonna tell you two a secret. But you have to promise not to tell anyone.
120003 I promise.
120007 Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
120005 I have a crush on Rarity!
120007 [gasp] We won't say a word!
120003 Give me a break. Everypony already knows how you-
120007 Twilight! You promised Spike you wouldn't say anything. He trusts you. And losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend forever!
120003 But-
120007 Forever!
120003 My lips are sealed. Though I'm pretty sure Rarity is gonna pick up on your feelings.
120000 [doorbell rings]
120093 I, Photo Finish... have arrived.
12000d Let me just say, what an honor!
120093 We begin... now!
12000d Attitude and pizzazz!
120093 Yes! Show Photo Finish something. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. No! Yeees. Enough!
120003 She hardly took any pictures.
12000e I'm so sorry. I tried my best.
12000d Well, the headdress is too big for you and cape had too much sparkle. I can't believe I ever thought I could impress her.
120093 It seems that I, Photo Finish, have found the next fashion star here in Ponyville.
12000d Really?
120093 Yes. Really. And I, Photo Finish, am going to help her to shine all over Eqvestria. Tomorrow, a photo shoot in ze park. [pause] I go!
12000d Did you hear that? I am going to "shine all over Equestria".
12000e Oh, Rarity. I was so worried I'd ruined everything.
12000d Oh, never. I knew you'd be perfect. [excited giggling]
12000d No, no, no, yes! That is definitely the one. Photo Finish is going to love it. Everypony is going to love it!
12000e Oh, I am so excited for you. Just don't forget us little ponies when you become the most famous designer in all of Equestria.
12000d Never.
120093 Put me down here. Oh, nonononononono. The model should be in something simple! Something inspired by... the nature!
12000d That's just what I was thinking. Um... give me a moment and I'll, uh, put a little something together.
120093 Yes... that will not be necessary.
12000d But... but... how are you going to help me "shine across Equestria" if I don't design something new for these pictures?
120093 I am not going to help you shine across Equestria. I am going to help her shine. She is my star. You! Go!
12000d [gasp]
12000e I can't, Rarity.
12000d Oh, but you must, Fluttershy. Photo Finish wants to make you a star. This is the opportunity of a lifetime. I know we were both hoping it would be my lifetime, but nonetheless you can't throw away this chance. You must do this for me. You must. You must! You must!
120093 Floottershy! It is time to make... the magics! Oh, wunderbar! You are like a delicate flower. So much more alluring without all those sparkles und feathers.
120007 How'd it go? How'd it go?
12000d It didn't. Photo Finish wanted to work with Fluttershy, not me.
120003 Oh, Rarity. I'm so sorry. Is there anything we can do?
12000d I just vant to be alone right now.
120005 You heard her. She vants to be... alone. What? I didn't think she meant alone alone.
120093 Too much blush. Not enough. Too much. Not enough. Perfect.
12000e Ah... Aaah... [tiny sneeze]
120093 Oh, yes! Even her schneezes are graceful. Now go! How do you feel? Excited? Overjoyed? Thrilled beyond your wildest dreams?
12000e N... nervous.
120093 Nervous? Dun be ridiculous. You're only facing a large crowd of ponies who will be watching your every move and silently judging you.
120000 [music]
120093 Your cue! Now go!
120094 No seriously...
120000 [ponies chattering]
120000 [cameras clicking]
12000e You can't let Rarity down. You must do this. You must. You must. You must.
120000 [ponies cheering]
120095 So graceful.
120096 So lovely.
12006e So perfect for my new advertisement.
12000d [gasp] [growl]
120023 It's Fluttershy!
120000 [ponies shouting excitedly]
120000 [bell rings]
12000d Wow. Look how popular you are. I'm so excited for you. You must be having the best time ever.
12000e Oh, yes. Best time ever...
120093 Floottershy! I have been looking for you everywhere. We have the thing at the place.
12000e I'll see you at the spa? Our usual time?
12000d Of course! I can't wait to hear all about the... "thing at the place".
12000e [yelp]
12000d I'm the one who should be mobbed by strangers wherever I go.
120000 [bell rings]
12000d Welcome to Carousel Boutique!
120027 Is she still here? We heard Fluttershy was here.
12000d Sorry. You just missed her. But you're still in luck. I'm having a huge sale on some of my best designs.
120027 And you are...?
12000d Rarity, of course.
120027 Never heard of you.
120093 Obviously I, Photo Finish, am thwilled to have found her.
12000e Photo Finish?
120093 She's a natural in front of the camera.
12000e Um... Photo Finish?
120093 I only need to point and shoot, and I capture... the magics!
120000 [ponies: Over here! Fluttershy, over here!]
12000e Photo Finish, I'm so sorry to interrupt. It's just that I'm running late.
120093 [gasp] How could I have forgotten?! Your appearance at the ballet opening! Everypony who is anypony will be there.
12000e Oh, actually I'm supposed to be meeting my friend...
120093 We go!
12000d My hooves are getting positively pruney, I've been waiting here so long. Obviously Fluttershy's just too busy with her new career to spend time with her best friend.
120003 I'm sure she just got tied up.
12000d Of course she did. She's a big bright shining star! I wish that star would burn out.
120003 Rarity! Fluttershy is your friend.
12000d I know, I know. And I should be happy for her, but instead I'm just... jealous! Oh, please promise you won't tell her I feel this way. Please, please, pleasepleaseplease!
120003 You have my word. Losing a friend's trust is the fastest way to lose a friend.
120007 Forever!
120003 Wow! You look great!
12000d Fluttershy may be the one who's famous, but that doesn't mean I have to stop looking fabulous.
12000e Rarity! I'm so sorry I'm... Oh no. She's already gone, isn't she?
120003 Sorry.
12000e Oh, I can't believe this. I am so frustrated, I could just scream. [inhales] [squeak]
120003 Feel better?
12000e [sighs] No. Can I tell you something?
120003 Of course.
12000e You promise not to tell Rarity?
120003 I swear.
12000e Pinkie Pie Swear?
120003 "Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my—" Ah!
12000e I don't like being a model. No, I hate being a model. All this attention is awful, just awful. And I'm only doing it because Rarity told me I must. I must! I must! [sigh] I must...
120003 Oh, really? Well... If you wanna know the truth, Rarity...
12000e Oh, what were you about to say?
120007 [quietly] Forever!
120003 Nothing!
120003 I was just thinking. If you really don't like being a model, you could always quit.
12000e Oh, no. I could never do such a thing. Rarity would be devastated.
120003 But Rarity told me— [gasp]
120007 [chomp] Mmm... Juicy!
120003 Ugh!
12000e Oh... If only all these ponies didn't like me so much, Photo Finish wouldn't want me to model anymore. She'd find somepony else with... the magic!
120003 I guess you're right. You're right. You're right, you're right, you're right!
12000f [gasp]
120097 It's Fluttershy!
12000f [yelling]
120003 Don't you see? On her own, Fluttershy could never do something unattractive. But if I used my magic to help her do something unattractive at her next fashion show, no one will ever want her to model again. And if Fluttershy no longer has to be a model, Rarity will no longer have to be jealous of her. And I'll no longer have to keep their secrets! It's the perfect plan! You can't tell anyone about it. Promise me you won't tell anyone?
120007 [miming]
120003 So you do promise or you don't?
120007 Uh, yes! Obviously, that's why I zipped my mouth closed, then locked it with a key, then dug a hole, then buried the key, then built a house on top of the hole where I buried the key, then moved into the house on top of the hole. [squee]
120003 Obviously.
120000 [ponies chattering]
12000e You really think it'll work?
120003 They love you for being you. So all I have to do is make you not be you. Just leave it to me.
120000 [music]
12000d Guess it's time to see what all the fuss is about.
12000e Oof!
120000 [music stops]
120000 [ponies gasp]
12000e [gasp] Ooh... Aah!
120000 [ponies gasping]
12000e [barks]
12000d Oh no.
12000e [brays]
120000 [ponies gasp]
12003a Get her off the stage!
120098 She's an embarrassment to all things fashion!
120093 I, Photo Finish, have made a terrible mistake!
120000 [ponies booing]
12000d Bravo! I say bravo!
120095 Bravo? Who could possibly say bravo to that horrid display?
12000d Such attitude! Such pizzazz! She's invented an entirely new kind of modeling! Bravo!
120095 Who is saying these things?
120096 It's her. The unicorn in the gorgeous cape and headdress.
120095 Now that is a pony who clearly knows a thing or two about fashion. Well, if that fabulous pony likes it, then I do too! Bravo!
120000 [ponies cheering]
12000e [moans]
12000e This is awful. Just awful! Somehow I've become more popular than ever. Oh, I'm so frustrated I could just kick something!
120000 [vase wobbles]
12000e If only Rarity didn't want me to be a model so badly.
120003 Ugh! But Rarity...!
12000d Fluttershy! Are you all right?
12000e I'm great! I'm a super famous fashion model. Why wouldn't I be great?
120003 Because you ha...!
12000d Out there on the runway, everyone was turning on you and... Oh... Oh, Fluttershy. It's so awful. I wanted them to.
12000e You did?!
120003 Of course she did! Because...!
12000d I'm jealous! I wanted all the attention. And instead it was going to you. I even started hoping that you would do something silly so your modeling career would be over. But then, when it started happening, all I could think was how could I want you to fail at something you love so much?
120003 But... Fluttershy doesn't... Ugh!
12000e Love? Oh, Rarity. I hate being a model.
12000d You do?
12000e More than anything.
12000d Then why did you keep doing it?
12000e I was afraid if I quit, you'd be mad at me for not wanting to... "shine all over Equestria".
12000d And I thought if I told you how jealous I was of your success, you'd think I was a terrible friend.
12000e Never!
12000d All this time!
12000e If we'd just told each other the truth.
12000d I promise never to keep my feelings in secret again.
12000e Me too.
12007e Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye. [laughs]
120093 You were brilliant. Brilliant! I've already got six photo shoots lined up for tomorrow alone.
12000e I'm sorry, Photo Finish, but I don't think I'll be able to make any of them.
120093 Whaaat?
12007e We go!
120093 Vat has just happened?
120003 Spike has a crush on Rarity!
120007 [sigh] And you were doing so well.
12000e Now this is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.
12000d Isn't it, though?
120003 Dear Princess Celestia,
120003 Being a good friend means being able to keep a secret. But you should never be afraid to share your true feelings with a good friend. Did you get all that, Spike?
120005 No. I did not. I still can't believe you told someone about my secret feelings for Rarity.
120003 You're right. That was wrong of me, and I'm very sorry.
120005 Apology accepted.
120003 Now will you take down my letter to Princess Celestia?
120005 I would love to. But... I'm a little busy at the moment.
120003 [sigh]
120000 [music]
120000 [credits]
121008 And that's when the yellow birdie thought to himself, "Hmm. My favorite little tree isn't such a little tree anymore." So she sang her song, big and strong, and they all lived in that great, big tree happily ever after. The end.
12100d Applejack! Were you reading a bedtime story to... an apple tree?
121008 Heh... uh... Well, ya know, bein' replanted in a whole new place is very upsettin' for a tree... and Bloomberg here is one of my favorites.
12100d No fair, Applejack! You've got a luxurious, private sleeper car for a tree, while I am crowded and cramped in the same car with all the other ponies. How am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?!
121008 But Bloomberg's the whole reason we're makin' this trip. He needs his rest so we can give him as a gift to my relatives in Appleloosa.
12100d Hmph! You talk about it as if it's your baby or something.
121008 Who you callin' a baby?! Bloomberg's no baby! Don't wet widdle Rarity make you all saddy-waddy. Bloomberg's a big and strong apple tree. Yes, he is. A-coochie-coochie-coo-coo-coo!
12100d It's widdle Rarity who's all "saddy-waddy"! Urgh!
121000 [theme song]
121000 [indistinct conversations]
12100c Oh man, we're going fast! This is so exciting, I can't even wait!
12100d [sigh] For crying out loud in the morning!
121005 [groan] Do you guys mind? I was up early fire-roasting those snacks you're all eating, and I'm pooped!
12100c Uh, speaking of, some of these popcorn kernels didn't get popped.
121005 Okay, fine...
12100c Ghk...
121005 Good night!
121003 Uhh... maybe it's time we all got a little shut-eye. We've got a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
121099 Awwww!
121005 [snoring]
12100c [whispering] Psst! Pinkie Pie, you asleep yet?
121007 [whispering] No, are you asleep yet?
12100c [whispering] If I was sleeping, how could I have asked you if you were asleep?
121007 [whispering] Oh yeah! [giggle]
12100c [whispering] When we get to Appleloosa, you think we'll have to carry that heavy tree all the way from the train to the orchard?
121007 [whispering] What tree? You mean Bloomberg?
12100c [whispering] ...No, Fluttershy.
121007 [whispering] Fluttershy's not a tree, silly!
121003 What's going on?
121007 Rainbow Dash thinks Fluttershy's a tree!
12100c [whispering] I do not think she's a tree! I was just–
121003 Did you say she was a tree?
12100c [whispering] No. Well.. Yes. But not exactly–
121003 Ya know she's not a tree, right?
121007 She's not a tree, Dashie!
12100e I'd like to be a tree...
121005 Oh, for Pete's sake!
121000 [door opens and slams]
121003 Well that was kind of huffy.
12100e Huffy the magic dragon!
12109a [giggle]
12100d Would you all be quiet NOW?!
12109a Aaah!
12101b [puff]
121005 Bloomberg...? Bloomberg? Sorry, but I tend to snore a bit. Good night. [sigh]
121000 [indistinct surprise]
121003 A buffalo stampede!
121000 [ponies awing]
12100d I just love their accessories!
121003 They're getting awfully close to the train.
121000 [ponies shouting indistinctly]
12100d I want to speak to the manager!
121005 [snoring]
121007 Oooh, looky! Now they're doing tricks! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Now do a backflip! Or... just jump?
12100c Hmm... Something tells me this isn't a circus act. Hey there!
12109b [gasp]
12100c Where ya headed in such a hurry? Wow, you're pretty quick for someone so... bulky. No offense.
12109b Huh..?
12100c I just wanna know– Hey! I'm talking to you– Whoa... Arrgggg... I got you now, you– [groan]
12109b [whistle]
121008 [gasp] They've got Bloomberg!
121005 Heeeelp!
121003 And Spike!
12100c Ugggh..
121005 [distant] Heeeelp!
12100c Dragon-napping Spike. I'll show her! Ow...
12109c Hey there! Welcome ta A-A-ppleloosa!
121008 Braeburn, listen–
12109c Cousin Applejack, mind yer manners, you have yet ta introduce me to your compadres! Shame on you!
121008 Braeburn, listen, somethin' terrible's happened–
12109c Terrible is right, your train is a full seven minutes late! That's seven minutes less for you to delight in the pleasures and wonders of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Boggles the mind, we settler ponies built all this in just the past year, don't it?! And as you can see, we have all of the finest comforts. Like horse-drawn carriages!
12109d Okay, you pull now.
12109e Aww, we just switched.
12109c And those there are horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages.
121008 ...Listen, Braeburn, I– Oof!
12109c And here's our local waterin' hole, the Salt Block.
12109f That's enough salt for you!
1210a0 Can't I at least... get a glass of water?
12109c Over there's the office of Sheriff Silverstar. And here's where we have our wild west dances! And here's where we have our mild west dances!
121008 But, Braeburn, we–
12109c And here's the most wonderful sight in all of... A-A-A-ppleloosa! Our apple orchard.
121008 Braeburn!
12109c First harvest should be any day now.
121008 Braebu–
12109c Good thing too!
121008 Brae–
12109c 'Cause we need that grub to live on.
121008 Braeburn!
12109c Uh, yes, cuz?
121008 You have a very nice town an' all, but we have a hu-uge problem! Some of our friends are missin'!
12100e A stampede of buffalo.
12100d They took Spike!
121003 Rainbow Dash went after them!
12100e And we can't find Pinkie Pie.
121008 And we had an apple tree with us for your orchard, but they took that too!
12109c Did you say... buffalo? [sigh] Them buffalo, they want us settler ponies to take every single tree you see here off this land. They sure as hay don't want any new ones added in.
12100e But why?
12109c Beats me. We put a lot of hard work into this land so we can feed our town, our families, our foals! And now they're sayin' all these trees have to go? T'ain't fair...
12100c Ooh, I can't wait to get my hooves on that little buffalo... Hnnh... Ow! Nobody tricks Rainbow Dash and gets away with it.
121007 Boo!
12100c Yah! ...Pinkie Pie!
121007 Ah, ya caught me! Looks like I tricked you and didn't get away with it either! You're good.
12100c Shhshh! What do you think you're doing?! You gotta get out of here!
121007 I do?
12100c You're gonna blow my cover.
121007 I am?
12100c I'm trying to save Spike!
121007 Oh my gosh! So am I!
12100c And the more of us there are out here, the more chances of us getting... caught. Run, Pinkie, I'll hold 'em off. Save yourself!
121005 Stop! Dash, Pinkie, 'sup? Hey, no worries, I know those guys. They're cool.
1210a1 If you say so, Spike. Catch ya later, bro.
121005 Seems they took me by mistake. And they feel awful about it too, poor guys. Fortunately, they totally respect dragons, so they treat me like an honored guest.
12100c [sniff] Ugh...
121005 Still don't like ponies much, though... But you're with me, so it's cool.
12100c Huh. Well, I still don't trust them. I say we turn tail and bail while we still–
121007 Mmm! [munching] Before we finish eating? Are you loco in the coco?! Can I please have more of that mushy stuff, whatever it was?
12109b Certainly. And, Mr Spike, you like gemstones, yes?
121005 Turquoise. Mmm! [munching] Heh hah! This here is Little Strongheart, and these are my friends Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash.
12100c You!
12109b You!
12100c That's it! We are outta here!
12109b Wait! Please accept my apologies for what happened on the train. We didn't mean for anyone to be hurt.
12100c Yeah, right.
12109b We only wanted the tree. The settler ponies have overtaken the land and have planted an orchard all over it! Because of their thoughtlessness, we can no longer run over our traditional stampeding grounds.
121030 Huh?
121005 I think it's time they met Chief Thunderhooves.
1210a2 Hmmh. We have a long and winding stampeding trail that we have run upon for many generations. [breath] My father stampeded upon these grounds, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him, and his father before him, and–
12109b I think they get the idea, Chief.
1210a2 Hmph. It is a sacred tradition to run the path every year. But this year, these... settler ponies, these... [snort] Appleloosans! [snorting]
12109b They planted apple trees all over it without asking our permission.
121007 Well that's not very nice. Right, Rainbow Dash?
12100c Hmph...
12109b The ponies refused to move their trees, so we are stuck here, and it is not fair!
121005 See, Rainbow Dash? They had a good reason to–
12100c Huh... Ah!
121000 [buffalo gasp]
12100c I'll say they had a good reason! C'mon. We have some apple-pickin' Appleloosans to talk to!
12100d Ow! [groaning] Gently, please!
121008 Sorry, Rarity, but our friends are out there and we have ta' be ready for a long hike into buffalo territory if we're gonna save 'em! Let's go!
121007 Hi, guys!
12100e Pinkie! We're so glad you're safe.
121000 [indistinct "Oh, there you are!" "Thank goodness!"]
121003 How did you escape from the buffalo?
121007 We didn't!
121000 [ponies gasp]
12100c We promised the buffalo a chance to talk.
121008 Oh, yeah? 'Bout what?
12100c We brought our new pal Little Strongheart here to explain to the Appleloosans why they should move the apple trees off buffalo land.
12109c That information would be quite help–
121008 That's weird. 'Cause my cousin Braeburn here wants to explain to the buffalo why they should let the apple trees stay.
12109b That would be a useful thing to–
12100c The land is theirs! You planted the trees not knowing that. Honest mistake. Now, you just gotta move 'em, that's all.
12109c Well... heh...
121008 They busted their rumps here! An' now they're supposed ta bust their rumps again, just 'cause some buffalo won't stampede someplace else?
12100c Plant the trees somewhere else!
121008 Where?! It's the only flatland around these parts!
12100c The buffalo had it first!
121008 The settler ponies need it to live!
12100c Come on, Applejack!
121008 [over Rainbow Dash] You're bein' unreasonable!
12100c [over Applejack] I put my hoof down!
121003 Look! Both the settlers and the buffalo have good reasons to use this land. There must be something we can do.
121007 Hey! I've got an idea!
121000 [piano intro]
121007 [Pinkie Pie]
121007 We may be divided
121007 But of you all, I beg
121007 To remember we're all hoofed
121007 At the end of each leg
121007 No matter what the issue
121007 Come from wherever you please
121007 All this fighting gets you nothing
121007 But hoof-and-mouth disease
121007 Arguing's not the way
121007 Hey, come out and play!
121007 It's a shiny, new day
121007 So, what do you say?
121007 You gotta share
121007 You gotta care
121007 It's the right thing to do
121007 You gotta share
121007 You gotta care
121007 And there'll always be a way through
121007 Both our diets, I should mention
121007 Are completely vegetarian
121007 We all eat hay and oats
121007 Why be at each other's throat?
121007 You gotta share
121007 You gotta care
121007 It's the right thing to do
121007 And there'll always be a way
121007 Throoooough!
121005 [applauds] All right, Pinkie Pie! That was fantastic! What a great song! Yeah, right on!
1210a2 It appears that Sheriff Silverstar and I have come to... an agreement.
1210a3 We have.
1210a2 That was the worst performance we've ever seen.
1210a3 Teh... Abso-tively!
1210a2 The time for action... Hmh... is upon us! Our stampede will start at high noon tomorrow. And if the orchard is still there, we'll flatten it... and the whole town!
121000 [ponies gasp]
12109b But, Chief!
1210a3 An' we Appleloosans say you'd better bring yer best, 'cause we'll be ready and waitin'.
12109c But, Sheriff...
121007 Oh... That wasn't the message of my song at all...
121008 I want my kin ta' have what they need to live... but a storm's a-brewin' here. And I don't like the look of it.
121003 We've just got to talk some sense into them before somepony gets hurt. Listen, maybe if you would just reconsider, we–
12100d About the trees. Now if you could–
121003 If we could just sit down and talk we could–
1210a4 Grrrrr!
121003 [gasp] Why won't anybody be rational and reasonable?!
121000 [hammering, sawing, and nailing]
121008 Sheriff, if we could only–
121000 [cheering]
121000 [buffalo snorting]
121005 Isn't there someway to stop this?
12109b Unless the settlers remove those trees, I do not think so.
121005 [sigh] [munching]
12100c I know you don't want to do this.
1210a2 But they have taken our land. What would you have me do, Rainbow Dash?
12100c I don't know... but it's never too late to think of something.
1210a2 At noon, it will be too late.
12100c Come on, think! Think, think, think, think, think, think, think!
121000 [clock strikes twelve times]
1210a2 [sigh]
12100c [gasp] He's not gonna do it!
1210a5 [sigh]
121007 [Pinkie Pie]
121007 –what do you say?
121007 You gotta share
121007 You gotta care
121007 It's the right thing to do
1210a2 Grrr...
1210a2 You gotta share
1210a2 Chaaarge!
1210a2 You gotta care
121007 Wah-ahh! Whoa-oo-oo-oo-ooa!
1210a6 [yelling]
1210a3 Ready... aim... fire!
121000 [pies splattering]
1210a7 [gasp]
121000 [clang!]
121000 [crash]
1210a3 Ah! Aah!
1210a2 [distorted] Nooo!
1210a1 [crying]
121005 [cries]
1210a2 Yum! Hey, I've got a much better idea!
121008 [whistle]
1210a2 We... will allow the apple orchard to stay in exchange for a share of its fruit, heh... Those... delicious apple pies!
121005 I'd rather eat turquoise any day of the week. [chomp] Auhh...!
121008 Bloomberg, this is yer special day. Mama's so proud of you!
121003 Dear Princess Celestia,
121003 Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing. Even the worst of enemies can become friends. You need understanding and compromise. You've got to share. You've got to care.
121007 Hey! That's what I said!
121000 [music]
121000 [credits]
12200e There you go, Mr Mousey. Now you stay off that leg and do everything I told you, and it will be just like new in no time at all.
1220a8 [squeaks]
12200e Oh, you're welcome. Happy to be able to help.
122040 [pants] [squeak]
12200e You... found a watch? You... wanna be a watch? You're running! Running out of time? No. You're... late?
122000 [clock strikes four]
12200e [gasp] I'm late for a very important date! The big brunch for Princess Celestia at Sugarcube Corner. Oh, the princess is here in Ponyville for a party, and we all promised we'd be there. But I'm not there! Oh, do I look all right? Do I need to bring anything? Maybe I shouldn't go.
122000 [trumpet fanfare]
12200e Aah! It's starting! I'm missing it!
122040 [sigh]
12200e Oh, thanks, Angel. I mean, if you hadn't reminded me, I might have not remembered, and then I wouldn't be there, and everypony would be wondering where I was and... Oh, right. I'm late.
122000 [door rattles]
12200e Oh, okay then. See you later.
122000 [theme song]
12200c So... what do I have to do to get to be one of the Princess's royal guards, anyway? Is the pay good? Hellooo? Anybody home? [babbles] Wah-wah! [babbles] Ooh, you're good. Too good. I'm bored.
12200e Phew. Made it. [gasp]
1220a9 Halt!
1220aa Who goes there?
12200e [gulp] No one. Never mind. I'll go home.
122003 It's all right, sirs. She's on the list.
12200e Thanks, Twilight.
122003 I'm so glad you could make it, Fluttershy. It wouldn't be the same without you.
122000 [bell rings]
12202b How's everypony doing? Good? Good.
12202a Anything else we can get for you, dearies...? Ooh, I-I mean, esteemed guests.
122019 Everything is fine, Mr and Mrs Cake.
12200e Sorry I'm late. I had to finish taking care of a patient first.
122003 Oh, you and your tender loving care of little animals. I just know Princess Celestia is gonna love that about you. I mean, I hope she will... I mean, of course she will!
12200e Wow, Twilight. I thought I was the only one who got nervous at social gatherings.
122003 Oh, it's not that. I just want the princess to approve of my friends.
12200e But she's met us all before.
122003 And read about you in my letters. But this is the first time she's spent any real time with you. I want everypony to make a good impression.
12200e Well, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about. Besides, it's just a casual get-together, right?
12200d Don't touch me! Watch the dress! Careful, you're gonna spill that on me! Oh, oh, that looks delicious. What is it? Oh, does it stain?! Keep it away from me!
12200e Or... perhaps not that casual.
122008 Uh... which is the salad and which is the appetizer again? And which am I supposed to eat first? Oh, never mind. I'm not hungry.
12200e It's okay, Twilight. So our friends' manners aren't perfect. I doubt the princess will even notice.
122007 [giggles] Whoo-hoo! Cupcakes, candies and pies, oh my! Oooh! Chocolate fountainy goodness! [munching] You gonna eat that?! [munching]
12202a [gasp]
122007 Hey!
12202b A thousand pardons, Your Majesty.
122019 That's quite all right, thank you. [sips]
12202a Empty teacup at 4 o'clock!
12202b Uh, I see it, honey bun!
122019 Oh, um... thank you.
12202b Not at all, Your Highness.
122019 [sips] Thank you again.
12202a Oh, but of course, Your Majesty.
122019 [sips] [sips] [sips] Gotcha!
122003 Oh...
122019 And what about you, dear? Fluttershy, is it?
12200e Me? Oh yes, Your Highness.
122019 I understand from Twilight Sparkle's letters that you enjoy tending to the needs of woodland creatures.
12200e Yes, I love to take care of animals.
122019 As do I. As Princess, I care deeply about all creatures, great and small.
122000 [cough]
122019 Nothing means more to me than the well-being of all my subjects.
1220ab [coughs and hacks]
122019 Ah, Philomena, my pet. You're awake. Do say hello to our gracious hosts.
1220ab [coughs and hacks]
12200e Oh... my.
122019 She is quite a sight, isn't she?
12200e I... I... I've never seen anything like it.
1220ab [cough]
1220ac [clears throat] [whisper]
122019 Really? Well, if I must... I'm sorry, everypony. I'm afraid I have to cut the party short. The mayor has requested an audience with me. Royal duty calls. Thank you for a wonderful time. It's been a joy getting to know you all better.
122008 Phew! Now I can eat someth'n! I'm starved! Oh...
122007 [whooping and giggling]
12200d Stay right where you are. All I want is a clear path to the exit. Nobody move and my dress won't get hurt! Stay back! Back, I say!
122003 [sigh] Well, Spike, I don't know for sure how things went with the princess, but at least no big disasters happened.
12200e Oh, you poor little thing. How did you ever get in such bad condition? Don't you worry, Philomena. I'll nurse you back to health. As a favor to the princess, who's obviously just far too busy to care for you properly.
1220ab [cough]
12200e I'm sure the princess will appreciate the help. Oh my. We'd better get you to bed right away. There.
122000 [steam whistle]
12200e [gasp]
1220ab [shivering]
12200e [gasp]
122000 [steam whistles and shivering]
122000 [thermometer glass shatters]
12200e This is far worse than I thought. What you need is some medicine. Stat!
1220ab [cough]
12200e Here you go, Philomena. This will fix you right up.
1220ab [sniff]
12200e Doctor Fluttershy expected that.
122000 [jackhammer sounds]
12200e Always works. [gasp] Uh... almost always.
1220ab [cough]
12200e There's nothing like homemade soup to cure what ails you. Come on now. You're not gonna get better if you don't cooperate. Mmm... see? It's delicious. Good and good for you. Here comes the choo-choo train. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo-whoo!
122000 [splash]
12200e Oh dear. Don't worry, Philomena. I know what'll make you feel better. Wait right here. I have just the thing.
1220ab [cough]
12200e Look, Philomena. I brought a fellow feathered friend by to cheer you up. Hummingway here was sick once too, but he let me help him and got better in no time. Didn't you, boy?
1220ad [humming "Mm-hmm!"]
12200e Say hello to your new friend Philomena.
1220ad [humming happily]
12200e Aw, look. I think he likes you. [vocalizes My Little Pony theme]
1220ad [hums My Little Pony theme]
12200e Your turn now, Philomena. Go ahead. You can do it. [vocalizes My Little Pony theme]
1220ab [heaves]
12200e Oh! Um... good try?
12200e I know what'll clear up that tickle in your throat. A humidifier. [deep breath] Refreshing. How's that feeling now for you, Philomena? Better?
1220ab [deep breath] [cough]
12200e Oh... that's okay. I know lots of other ways to take care of you. Don't worry. You're gonna get better. How about...
12200e Aromatherapy?
1220ab [sneeze]
12200e Warm bath?
12200e Ointment?
12200e Scalpel. Surgical tape. Feathers.
1220ab [cough]
12200e Oh, Philomena. I thought it would be easy to nurse you back to health. I've tried everything I know. And look at you. You're worse than ever.
122000 [knocking]
122003 Hi, Fluttershy! I just wanted to drop by and say thank you so very much for making such a good impression on the princess today— [gasp] What is Celestia's pet doing here?!
12200e I couldn't leave the poor thing there. She needed my help.
122003 Oh no. Nonononononono! This is bad.
12200e How could I just walk away and not do anything?
122003 But... but... she doesn't belong to you!
12200e I had to do something.
122003 Without telling anypony?! Without asking permission?!
12200e But...
1220ab [cough]
122003 I know you had good intentions, but you have got to return the princess's pet!
12200e But...
1220ab [deep breath]
12200e [sigh] You're right. Okay, let's...
1220ab [cough]
12200e ...go.
122003 If we hurry, we can put her back before anypony even realizes she's missing. [gasp]
1220a9 We were told we could find Twilight Sparkle here.
1220aa We regret to inform you, miss, that the royal pet has gone missing.
122003 Really? You don't say! [nervous laughter]
1220ab [cough]
122003 [cough]
1220ab [cough]
122003 [cough]
122084 [excessive coughing]
122003 It's that dry night air?
12200e But it's daytime.
122003 Well... day air's even drier. You guards better be on your way if you're gonna find the princess's missing pet. Philomena, was it? Thank you ever so much for keeping me in the loop. Bye! [pants] Phew... What are you doing?!
12200e Going to return Philomena, remember?
122003 We can't now!
12200e Why not?
122003 You have no idea what the princess is gonna do if she finds you're the one who took her pet, do you?!
12200e Do you?
122003 Well... no. But it can't be anything good. She might banish you from Equestria. Or throw you in a dungeon. Or banish you and then throw you in a dungeon in the place that she banishes you to!
12200e You really think the princess would do that?
122003 Okay. Granted that probably won't happen, but do you wanna take any chances?
12200e All that really matters to me is that poor little Philomena here gets well.
1220ab [cough]
122003 That's very noble of you. I'll write to you when you're banished. Unless I'm banished to somewhere there's no post office. Then you'll have to write to me. Deal?
12200e Please, Twilight. You just have to help me get Philomena healthy and then we can return her to the princess. And everything will be fine.
122003 Did you give her any kind of medicine?
12200e I tried to, but she wouldn't take it.
122003 [groan] Then you have to make her take it. You can't be such a pushover, Fluttershy! You need to show this patient who's the boss. Make her straighten up and fly right!
12200e She can't fly.
122003 No excuses! Done. Okay, what else?
12200e Uh... well, she keeps pulling her feathers off. The ones that haven't fallen out yet from all her coughing, I mean.
122003 There you go.
1220ab [groaning]
12200e I don't think she likes it.
122003 Tough love, baby. You want her to get well, don't you?
12200e Of course, but...
122003 Next!
12200e Well, she desperately needs some bed rest, but I can't get her to stay put.
122003 One step ahead of you.
1220ab [growling]
12200e It's for your own good, Philomena, I promise. Please, just relax and try to get some sleep.
122003 What's this soup over here? Smells delicious.
12200e I made it for Philomena. But she wouldn't eat it.
122003 Oh, she'll eat it, all right.
1220ab [screams]
122003 Hey! Where are you going?
12200e No! Philomena! Come back!
122000 [Benny Hill-esque music]
12200c What are you two doing? Are you having a race? Oh, can I play? One, two, three, go!
122007 [munching]
12200e Excuse me!
122007 Hi!
122003 Beg your pardon!
12200d Put me down!
122008 What in tarnation?!
12200e Sorry, but we've gotta find...
1220ac The princess's pet bird!
1220ab [cough]
12200e Philomena, come down from there! You'll hurt yourself!
1220ab [cough, exaggerated death rattle] [repeats]
12200e I'll catch you!
122007 [gasp]
122000 [Philomena bursts into flames]
12200e [gasp]
122015 [gasp]
12200e [whimpers]
122019 What is going on here? Twilight?
122003 Yes, your Majesty, there's been a terrible accident.
12200e It's all my fault.
122003 No, Princess. Fluttershy didn't know any better. It was my fault.
12200e I'm the one who did it.
122003 But you were only trying to help.
12200e Some help I was.
122003 Will ya let me do this? She'll go easier on me.
12200e But it's my fault!
122003 No, it's my fault!
122007 No, it's my fault! Wait, what are we talking about?
12200e Thanks for trying to protect me, Twilight, but... Princess Celestia, I'm the one who took your pet bird. I really was only trying to help the poor little thing. Then I was gonna bring it right back to you, honest. So, if you wanna banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to, then that's what I deserve.
122019 Oh, stop fooling around, Philomena. You're scaring everypony.
122000 [ponies gasp and awe]
12200e I don't understand! What is that thing? What happened to Philomena?
122019 This is Philomena. She's quite a sight, as I said. But nothing unusual for a phoenix. Isn't that right, Philomena?
1220ab [squawks]
12200e A... A phoenix?
122019 A phoenix is a majestic and magical bird. While it appears healthy and happy most of the time, every so often it must renew itself by shedding all of its feathers and bursting into flame. [whispering] Rather melodramatic, if you ask me. [normal voice] It then rises from the ashes, fresh as a daisy. All just a normal part of the life cycle of a phoenix. I'm afraid mischievous little Philomena here took the occasion to have a little fun with you, Fluttershy. Say you're sorry, young lady.
1220ab ["I'm sorry" sound]
12200e So... aren't you gonna banish me? Or throw me in a dungeon? Or banish me and then throw me in a dungeon in the place that you banish me to?
122019 Of course not, my little pony. Where on Earth would you get such an idea?
12200e I guess I have some imagination.
122003 Fluttershy really did do everything she could to try to take care of Philomena for you.
122019 And I do appreciate that your heart was in the right place, child. But all you had to do was ask me and I could have told you Philomena was a phoenix and saved you all this trouble.
12200e I know. I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions. Next time I'll ask before taking matters into my own hooves.
122003 Should I write you a letter about that lesson, Princess?
122019 No, that's quite all right. I think I can remember.
12200e It's beautiful. Thank you, Philomena. No hard feelings.
12200c Hmm... [indistinct whispers] Hey, you know what you should do? You should go over there and tickle them!
122000 [royal guards laugh]
12200c Yeah! [laughs]
122000 [laughter]
122000 [music]
122000 [credits]
123066 [gulp] Are you sure about this, Scootaloo? I've never even heard of a pony zip lining before.
123065 Neither have I, but Spike told me it was awesome!
123000 [whirring]
123000 [snap]
123080 [scream]
123065 Whoa!
123066 Oh!
12300a Wah!
123000 [crash]
123080 Ow!
12300a See anything?
123065 Tree sap and pine needles but no cutie mark.
123066 Plan B?
123065 Yeah. You know where we can find a cannon at this hour? It's no use! No matter what we try, we always end up without our cutie marks. And, surprisingly often, covered in tree sap.
123066 Maybe we should do something less dangerous, like pillow testing or flower sniffing.
12300a This town is full of ponies who have their cutie marks. Why don't we ask them how they did it?
123066 That's a great safe idea.
123065 Yeah! And we can start with the coolest pony in Ponyville.
12300a Applejack!
123066 Rarity!
123065 Come on, guys, I said "cool"! You know who I'm talking about. She's fast. She's tough. She's not afraid of anything!
123081 Pinkie Pie?
123065 No! The greatest flyer ever to come out of Cloudsdale.
123081 Fluttershy?
123065 No! Rainbow Dash!
12300a Oh! Yeah, that makes much more sense.
123066 Of course!
123065 Let's do it. Let's find out how Rainbow Dash earned her cutie mark!
123081 Yeah!
123066 Aah! Uuh!
123080 [groan]
123000 [theme song]
123065 [gasp]
123000 [screech]
123008 Get back here, you thievin' varmints!
12300a Thievin' what now?
123000 [crash]
123008 Apple Bloom?
12300a Hey sis! How'd you get your cutie mark?
123008 I never told you that story?
123065 Hey! I thought we were gonna ask Rainbow Dash.
12300a We need all the help we can get.
123065 Ugh. Fine.
123008 Why, shoot. I was just a little filly. Even littler than y'all.
123008 [voiceover] I didn't want to spend my life on a muddy old apple farm. I wanted to live the sophisticated life, like my Aunt n' Uncle Orange. So I set out to try my luck in the big city, Manehattan! The most cosmopolitan city in all of Equestria.
1230ae Hey! Outta the way, you rube!
123008 [voiceover] I knew I'd find out who I was meant to be in Manehattan.
123000 [knocking]
1230af Aunt Orange! Uncle Orange! Thank y'all so much for lettin' me stay!
1230b0 "Y'all". [laughs] Isn't she just the living end?
1230b1 [chuckle] How quaint.
1230b0 Don't worry. We'll have you acting like a true Manehattanite in no time.
1230b2 And how are you finding good old Manehattan?
1230af Oh, it's simply divine.
1230b0 Very well said, my dear.
1230af Although, I must admit the city noise took some getting used to. Where I'm from, nights are so quiet, you seldom hear a peep until the roosters wake you.
1230b3 The... what?
1230b2 I say, my dear, what in the world is a "rooster"?
1230af [voiceover] What's he talking about? What do I say? I don't wanna look like a fool.
123000 [bell rings]
123034 Dinner is served.
1230af Thank goodness. Being a city pony's hard work. I'm so hungry I could eat a...
1230af Cock-a-doodle-doo... Oh, I wonder what Granny Smith and Big McIntosh are up to. I bet they're applebuckin' their way through the Red Delicious trees. Oh, what I wouldn't give for just one bite...
123008 [voiceover] I never felt so homesick in all my days as I did right then.
123000 [explosion]
123008 [voiceover] It was amazin'! A rainbow pointin' right back to... home. In that moment, it all became clear. I knew right then just who I was supposed to be. That's when this here appeared.
123008 I've been happily workin' in the farm ever since.
123000 [bunnies blow raspberry]
123008 There they are! Get back here, ya thievin' varmints!
123066 Aw. That was such a sweet story!
123065 Sweet? Try sappy. [mock-gags] Come on! We've got to find Rainbow Dash and hear the cool way to get a cutie mark.
123080 [scream]
12300e All right, little ones. This way. This way. You really should be more careful. Somepony could get hurt. Why are you in such a hurry anyway?
123065 We're trying to find Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she earned her cutie mark.
12300e Oh, that would be interesting. You know, I wouldn't have gotten my cutie mark if it weren't for her.
123065 Rainbow Dash?! Really?!
12300e Oh yes. It all started at Summer Flight Camp.
12300e [voiceover] You'd never guess, but when I was little I was very shy. And a very weak flyer.
1230b4 [yelping]
1230b5 [laughter] Nice going, "Klutzershy"! They oughtta ground you permanently.
1230b6 Ha! My baby brother can fly better than you!
12300e [voiceover] It was the most humiliating moment of my life. And then, out of nowhere...
1230b7 Leave her alone!
1230b6 Ooh, what are you gonna do, "Rainbow Crash"?
1230b7 Keep making fun of her and find out!
1230b5 You think you're such a big shot? Why don't you prove it?
1230b7 Whaddya have in mind?
1230b6 You're going down!
1230b7 In history, maybe. See you boys at the finish line!
1230b4 [yelps] [screams]
1230b4 [screaming] Huh?
12300e [voiceover] I had never seen such beautiful creatures. Butterflies don't fly as high as my cloud home. And I'd never been near the ground before.
1230b4 [Young Fluttershy]
1230b4 What is this place
1230b4 Filled with so many wonders?
1230b4 Casting its spell
1230b4 That I am now under
1230b4 Squirrels in the trees
1230b4 And the cute little bunnies
1230b4 Birds flying free
1230b4 And bees with their honey
1230b4 Hooooonneeeeeeey!
1230b4 Oooh, what a magical place
1230b4 And I owe it all to the Pegasus race
1230b4 If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve
1230b4 I'd have come here sooner, and never leave
1230b4 Yes, I love ev-er-ythiiiiing!
123000 [explosion]
123000 [hysterical animal sounds]
1230b4 Shhh. It's okay. You can come out. Everything's okay. There's nothing to be afraid of.
12300e [voiceover] Somehow I had the ability to communicate with the animals on a different level.
123065 Wait, wait, wait. What happened to Rainbow Dash? What about the race?
12300e Oh. Well, I wasn't there, so I don't really know what happened.
123065 Come on, Crusaders. We've gotta find her. Besides, I can't take anymore singing.
123066 Maybe my sister knows where she is. Bye, Fluttershy!
12300e Bye, girls!
123065 How did we get roped into this? Oh, we'll never hear Rainbow Dash's story.
12300d Are you girls still obsessing over your cutie marks?
123066 Of course! Most of the fillies at school already have theirs.
12300d Mmm, I know how you feel. For the longest time I couldn't figure out why I didn't have mine.
123000 [music]
1230b8 Well done, Rarity. Your costumes are very nice.
1230b9 Nice?! They need to be spectacular! And the performance is tomorrow!
12300d [voiceover] I tried every trick I could think of, but nothing seemed to work. The costumes just weren't right, and the play opened that night.
1230b9 Maybe I'm not meant to be a fashionista after all... Aah! What's going on?!
12300d [voiceover] I had no idea where my horn was taking me. But unicorn magic doesn't happen without a reason. I knew this had to do with my love of fashion and maybe even my cutie mark! I knew that this was... my destiny!
1230b9 A rock?! That's my destiny?! What is your problem, horn? I followed you all the way out here for a rock?! [groans] Dumb rock!
123000 [explosion]
1230b9 [scream]
123000 [rock cracks]
1230b9 Ooh!
123000 [music]
123000 [ponies awing]
123065 Ugh! These namby-pamby stories aren't getting us any closer to our cutie marks! They're all about finding who you really are and boring stuff like that.
12300d Yes, Scootaloo, that's exactly...
123065 Come on, girls! We need action! We need Rainbow Dash!
123003 As a young filly in Canterlot, I always wanted to go to the Summer Sun Celebration, where Princess Celestia raises the sun.
123003 [voiceover] And I saw the most amazing, most wonderful thing I've ever seen.
123000 [trumpet fanfare]
123000 [ponies awing and cheering]
123003 [voiceover] I poured myself into learning everything I could about magic.
1230ba [grunting] [gasp]
123003 [voiceover] My parents decided to enroll me in Princess Celestia's School for Gifted Unicorns. It was a dream come true! Except for one thing... I had to pass an entrance exam!
1230bb Well, Miss Sparkle?
1230ba [nervous laughter]
1230bb Well, Miss Sparkle?
1230bc [cough]
1230ba [groaning]
1230bd [yawn]
1230bb We don't have all day.
123003 [voiceover] I knew it was the most important day of my life, that my entire future would be affected by the outcome of this day and I was about to blow it!
1230ba I'm sorry I wasted your time.
123000 [explosion]
1230ba Aah!
123000 [magic surging]
123019 Twilight Sparkle.
1230ba Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean...
123019 You have a very special gift. I don't think I've ever come across a unicorn with your raw abilities.
1230ba Huh?
123019 But you need to learn to tame these abilities through focused study.
1230ba Huh?!
123019 Twilight Sparkle, I'd like to make you my own personal protégé here at the school.
1230ba Huh?!
123019 Well?
1230ba Yes!
123019 One other thing, Twilight.
1230ba More? My cutie mark! Yesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyesyes...
123003 ...yesyesyesyes...
12300a Okay, okay.
123066 We're happy for you, Twilight.
123065 Yeah, thrilled. Let's get out of here while we still can.
123003 ...yesyes, yeeees!
1230be Are you okay?
123003 [giggle] Um... yes.
123065 Ugh! Why don't we ever smash into Rainbow Dash?!
123007 You're looking for Rainbow Dash? If I was her, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Of course, if I was anyone, I'd be at Sugarcube Corner. Hey! I have an idea! Wanna go to Sugarcube Corner?
123066 Well, we're sort of looking for Rainbow Dash, so we can hear how she got her cutie mark.
123007 Cutie mark? Come with me and I'll tell you how I got mine!
123065 [sigh] Why not?
123007 All right!
123007 [voiceover] My sisters and I were raised on a rock farm outside of Ponyville. We spent our days working the fields. There was no talking. There was no smiling. [sigh] There were only rocks.
123000 [bell ringing]
123007 We were in the south field, preparing to rotate the rocks to the east field, when all of a sudden...
123000 [explosion]
123000 [wind whistling]
123007 [voiceover] I'd never felt joy like that before! It felt so good I just wanted to keep smiling forever! And I wanted everyone I knew to smile too, but rainbows don't come along that often. I wondered, how else could I create some smiles?
123000 [rooster crows]
1230bf We better harvest the rocks from the south field.
123000 [muffled music]
1230c0 Pinkamena Diane Pie! Is that you?
1230c1 Mom! I need you and dad and the sisters to come in. Quick!
123000 [door creaks open]
1230c1 Surprise! You like it? It's called... a party!
123000 [party tweeter]
1230c1 Oh. You don't like it. [gasp] You like it! I'm so happy!
123007 And that's how Equestria was made!
123065 Wha... huh?
12300a Look! We're here!
123007 Maybe on the way home I can tell you the story of how I got my cutie mark. It's a gem!
123066 Oh, come on. She's just being Pinkie Pie.
123065 Ugh...
123065 Rainbow Dash! You're here!
12300c I hear you're looking for my cutie mark story.
123065 [sigh] You have no idea what I've been through today to hear that story.
12300c It all happened during the race at Flight Camp...
12300c [voiceover] ...where I stood alone against all odds to defend Fluttershy's honor.
1230b4 [yelps]
12300c [voiceover] I've never flown like that before! That freedom was unlike anything I've ever felt! The speed, the adrenaline, the wind in my mane... I liked it... a lot!
1230b7 Ow!
1230b6 Ha! Later, Rainbow Crash!
1230b7 Hey!
12300c [voiceover] Turns out the only thing I liked more than flying fast... was winning!
123000 [explosion]
12300c [voiceover] Most people thought that the sonic rainboom was just an old mare's tale. But that day... The day I discovered racing... I proved that the legends were true. I made the impossible happen!
123000 [Pegasi cheering]
12300c And that, little ones, is how you earn a cutie mark.
123080 Whooooaaaa...
12300e Wait a second. I heard that explosion. And I saw the rainbow too. Rainbow Dash, if you hadn't scared the animals, I never would have learned I could communicate with them and gotten my cutie mark.
123007 I heard that boom! And right afterwards, there was this amazing rainbow that taught me to smile.
123008 When I got my cutie mark, I saw a rainbow that pointed me home. I bet it was your sonic rainboom!
12300d There was an explosion I could never explain when I got my cutie mark.
123003 This is uncanny! If that explosion didn't happen when it did, I would have blown my entrance exam. Rainbow Dash, I think you helped me earn my cutie mark too!
12300c Whoa!
123007 We all owe our cutie marks to you!
12300e Do you realize what this means? All of us had a special connection before we even met.
12300d We've been BFFs forever and we didn't even know it!
123008 Come here, y'all.
123012 AWWW!!!
12300e I'm so glad we're friends!
123007 I love you, guys!
123081 Awwww...
123065 Ewwww... Gimme a break. Come on, Crusaders! Maybe we just need to try zip lining again. [sigh]
12300e Hey. How about a song?
123000 [cries of approval]
123007 Definitely!
123065 Nooooo!
123003 Dear Princess Celestia,
123003 Today I learned something amazing. Everypony everywhere has a special magical connection with her friends, maybe even before she's met them. If you're feeling lonely and you're still searching for your true friends, just look up in the sky. Who knows? Maybe you and your future best friends are all looking at the same rainbow.
123005 Gross! When did you get so cheesy?
123003 Just write it, Spike.
123000 [music]
123000 [credits]
124003 This meteor shower tonight's gonna be amazing!
124005 Awesome!
124003 You know, this shower only happens once every one hundred years.
124005 A centennial celebration!
124003 We better get a move on!
124005 Don't wanna be late! Whoa, whoa, whoa! [sigh] There.
124003 Spike, did you grab my quill and ink?
124005 Check!
124003 Scrolls?
124005 Check! I've also packed a telescope, apples, bananas, fruit punch, and my freshly baked homemade triple-decker nut-crazy vanilla cream cookies!
124003 [giggle] I can see that. Once again you've read my mind, Spike. And that is why you are my number one assistant.
124005 I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.
124003 That is why you are my number one assistant.
124005 Missed that! Huh...?
124003 I said... [giggle] Come on, let's get going. Wait! I almost forgot! I wanna bring the "Astronomical Astronomer's Almanac to All Things Astronomy".
124005 The Astronomo-lomo homono what?
124003 You know that really old big blue book on stars, moons, planets, the universe...?
124005 Right. Check! Ah... Ahh... Ahhh... Ahhhh...! [sigh] [sneeze]
124003 Hey! What's taking my number one assistant so long?
124000 [theme song]
124003 I was sure I put the astronomer's guide back. The book would have helped me identify different planets and stars tonight.
124005 Well... maybe someone borrowed it. Besides, you don't need that book. You can already name all the planets and stars, 'cause you're super smart and astronomically awesome!
124003 Thanks, Spike. You're such a flatterer.
124005 Yeah, I'm a sweet talker.
124003 And a number one assistant, right?
124005 Check!
12400c [munch] [gulp] Wow, Twilight! You're lucky to have such a rad assistant. I wish I had someone to do whatever I told them.
124065 Ooh! Ooh! Me! Me! Me! I'll do whatever you want, Rainbow Dash!
12400c Oh yeah, pipsqueak? How about taking out the trash?
124065 Yes ma'am!
12400d Do we have Spike to thank again for this amazing spread? Isn't he simply amazing?
124005 Oh, come on... I said come on.
124007 Little Spikey-wikey! Who knew that big ferocious dragon started off so cutesy wootsy?
12400d Spike, you are such a little star that I had to make a little bow tie for you.
124005 Gosh, you guys are embarrassing me. Stop it. ...Twilight, your turn.
124003 Spike, that's enough.
124005 Oh, right. That's enough.
124066 Hey, everypony! The show is starting!
1240c2 [Woah! That's amazing! I can't believe it!]
124049 Woah...
124005 [yawn] Huh?
1240c2 [excited chatter]
124007 Mmm. Wow! These cookies are delish!
124003 Spike made them. Speaking of, Spike, can you bring us some punch? Spike?
124005 [snoring]
12400d Oh, poor little thing.
124003 Aww... He's worked himself to the bone.
124007 And now the punch has been... "spiked"!
124012 [laughing]
124005 [snoring]
124003 Goodnight, Spike. [giggle] Sweet dreams, number one assistant. [sigh] "The Study of Comets. Comets are small, irregularly shaped bodies that are made of nonvolatile grains and frozen gases. They..."
124000 [creaking]
124003 Huh. "...have body structures that are fragile and diverse..."
124000 [creaking]
124000 [wind whistling]
124003 Shoot! Oh... This is a job for Spike. If only he were awake...
1240c3 Hoo!
124003 Wait! Don't go! Don't be afraid. Thank you for returning my scroll.
1240c3 Hoo! Hoo! Hoo-hoo.
124003 Gosh, it's cold tonight. Say, would you like to relax in here and keep me company while I work?
1240c3 Hoo! Hoo!
124003 Now, where was I? Oh, yes. "...fragile and diverse with a surrounding cloud of material called a coma, that grows in size and brightness as the comet approaches the sun..."
124005 [snoring] Huh? Waah! I overslept! I know it's already ten, but I'm scaly-tailed and bright-eyed and ready to work twice as fast! Oh please, don't be upset, Twilight! And what do you want for breakfast? Oatmeal? How about a sunflower smoothie? Grass pancakes?
124003 Spike, don't worry.
124005 But my morning chores...
124003 It's okay. Owlowiscious did them for you.
124005 Who?
124003 He's our new junior assistant. He's gonna help out with your chores so you won't be so tired all the time.
124005 Wha... Wh... What do we need a junior assistant for? I'm not tired. I do fine on my own. I don't need sleep, I...
124003 Spike, don't worry. He's just here to help out a little. Now, I have to go out, so why don't you introduce yourself to Owlowiscious? He's in the library.
124005 Worried? Do I look worried? I'm not worried. Who's worried? Hello? Hellooo! Whoa! Dude, that's creepy. Uh... Hi there! I'm Spike. I'm sure Twilight has told you all about me.
1240c3 Hoo.
124005 Uh, Spike? You know, assistant number one?
1240c3 Hoo?
124005 I'm Spike! And who are you? What are you?
1240c3 Hoo!
124005 Who?
1240c3 Hoo!
124005 I thought your name was Owlowiscious!
1240c3 Hoo?
124005 Okay, "Who", "Owlowiscious", whatever. I'm Spike, okay? Look! All you need to know is that I'm number one and you're number two. Got it?
1240c3 Hoo?
124005 So, a man of mystery, huh? I'm keeping my eye on you! I've got eyes in the back of my head too, you know. [crash] Well, not really, but... you know what I mean!
124000 [door slams]
124005 That bird is out for my job. He wants to be number one. I'll prove to Twilight that I deserve to be number one, not Freaky Feathers over there. I won't let him have my job if it's the last thing I do!
124007 Oh, what a fantastical, flufflicious feathery little friend! I'm... hooked!
124012 [laugh]
12400e He's just wonderful.
124005 [mocking] He's just wonderful. [normal] Uh, yes. Wonderful. He's quite... the charmer.
12400d And Owlowiscious is just such a star I just had to make this little bow for you.
124005 Grrr!
124008 What's he all saddle sore about?
12400c He's probably just jealous of Owlowiscious.
12400e Maybe Spike feels threatened or worried that Owlowiscious will replace him?
124003 Replace him? Hah! That's crazy! Spike knows he can't be replaced.
124005 They're trying to replace me! I better step it up and make sure that Twilight and Owlowiscious know that I'm still number one!
124003 Hey, Spike! Can you fetch me that book called "Two-headed Myth—
124005 ...Mythological Mysteries!" I know where it is.
124003 Thanks, Owlowiscious. Hey, Spike, no worries. Owlowiscious flew up and got the book for me. Oh, and gee! I guess I need "Ferrets of Fairyland" too.
124005 Hey! Whoa! Whoa!
124003 Climb down from there before you fall.
124000 [crash]
124005 Grrr!
124000 [snap]
124003 Shoot!
124005 Yes, sir!
124003 My last writing quill. It's broken.
124005 Never fear! Spike, your number one assistant, is here! [under his breath] Quill... Quill... Where is it? Not here... Quill... Quill, where is it...?
1240c3 Hoo.
124005 Where am I gonna get a quill?
124003 Spike, wait! Wait!
124005 But the store is called "Quills and Sofas". You only sell two things!
1240c4 Sorry, Junior. All outta quills until Monday. Need a sofa?
124005 [groan]
124007 I swore I had one here somewhere. Ah, here it is! A quince!
124005 Not a quince. A quill!
124007 Right. A quail? A quilt! A quesadilla? Aha! A quiche!
124005 Not a quiche. A quill!
124007 Nope. Sorry. All outta quills.
124005 [sigh] Shoot.
124005 Come on, chicken! Here, chicky-chicky-chicky! Here, chick-chick-chick-chicky! Come here! Ugh! Come here! [grunting] Not the face, not the face! No! Hey! Stop! Quit it!
124005 [panting] Spike... to the rescue.
124003 Oh, Spike. I was calling out for you when you were turning this place upside down. Owlowiscious gave me one of his feathers to use as a quill.
124005 That's just great. Perfect! Sweet! I think I'll just, uh... finish up the rest of my chores! Or did Owlowiscious already do them?
124003 Oh, no no. There are quite a lot of them.
124005 Well, that's fine. Because I can just stay up all night and finish– [snoring]
124003 Poor Spike. He'll come around. He's genuinely a good little guy.
124005 Huh?
124003 Spike. What is this? You said this book was missing. Well, Owlowiscious found it right where it belongs, but like this. How did it get this way?
124005 Uh... Well, um... You see, I... I just didn't wanna disappoint you and, uh... Have you ever seen a dragon sneeze?
124003 I've seen a dragon lie. I'm very disappointed in you, Spike.
124005 [to Owlowiscious] You set me up! Well, two can play that game.
1240c3 Hoo!
124005 Not "who"! Two! Urgh!
124005 Owlowiscious is out to take my place, I just know it! I've gotta stop him. But how?
124000 [mouse squeaking]
124005 Ah... Muahahaha!
12400d Come along, Opal. Let's hurry up and get to Fluttershy's tea party.
124005 So lifelike. And when Twilight discovers it shredded up on her floor, she'll think mouse-eating Owlowiscious is to blame. And I'll be number one... again! Muhahaha!
124005 [evil laugh] That poor little field mouse! Torn to pieces! It must have been Owlowiscious! You know, since owls eat, you know, mice. What a terrible, terrible bird! He must be punished! Right?
124003 Spike! I don't know what upsets me more—that you deliberately tried to set up Owlowiscious, or that you actually thought this pathetic attempt would work! You've let your jealousy get the best of you, Spike. I am truly disappointed. This is not the Spike I know and love.
124005 She... She doesn't love me anymore.
124005 Twilight hates me. I'm cold, hungry, tired and lonely. Could it get any worse?
124000 [thunder]
124005 I guess that's a yes. Hello? Hello?
124000 [thunder]
124005 What is that? If this is what running away is all about, I never wanna go home! Gems! Mmm... Woohoo!
124005 [hiccup] Even if my tummy's full, the rest of me is still empty. I miss Twilight and the pony gang. But she doesn't love me anymore. So, I'm better off here, all by myself. Wow. Seems to be getting warmer. The steam is great for my complexion, but it's sure getting hot in here.
1240c5 What are you doing in my cave? And why are you eating my gems?
124005 Uh, heyah bro! I didn't know this was your cave. And I didn't know these were your gems, but... we're cool, right?
1240c5 [growl]
124005 Whoa, whoa! Hey... We're like brothers, you know? I mean, you're a dragon, I'm a dragon... It's us against the world, right?
1240c5 [roar]
124005 [yelp] You don't scare me! So you're big.
1240c5 [growl]
124005 Really big. And your claws are super sharp. Tail... extra spiky. But, uh... You don't scare me! Ha! How'd you like that?
1240c5 [breathes fire]
124005 Uh... I'd love to stay, but gotta go! See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya! Aah!
1240c3 Hoo-hoo!
1240c5 [roar] [wail]
124003 Spike! Over here!
124005 Am I glad to see you!
124003 Hurry! Hop on! It's too dark! I can't see!
1240c3 Hoo! Hoo-hoo!
1240c5 [roar]
124005 [sigh]
124003 [pants] Spike. We were so worried about you. I was so worried about you. Why did you run away?
124005 I thought you didn't need me anymore. And that you didn't love me anymore.
124003 Spike. Sure, I was disappointed, but you are my number one assistant! And friend. And you always will be. It's just that sometimes I need some help at night. I can't ask you to stay up late. You're a baby dragon and you need your rest. Owls are nocturnal. So I asked Owlowiscious to help. But not to take your place. No one could ever replace you, Spike. Not even when you are being a jealous numbskull.
124005 I'm sorry, Twilight. I never should have been so jealous.
124003 And I'm sorry too, Spike. I should have been more sensitive.
124005 And Owlowiscious... I know now that you weren't out to take my job. Forgive me?
1240c3 Hoo?
124005 Me. Forgive me, Spike.
1240c3 Hoo!
124003 [giggle] He forgives you, Spike.
124005 Hey! How did you guys know where I was?
124003 It was your ketchup-covered feet. Owlowiscious discovered your footprints and we followed them all the way to the cave.
124005 Oh yeah, the ketchup. It looked pretty real though, didn't it? Uh... [nervous giggle]
124003 I know Princess Celestia will wanna read about what happened today...
124005 I'm ready when you are.
124003 Hey, Spike. Why don't you write to Princess Celestia? And tell her what you've learned?
124005 Really? Why, that's a big responsibility!
124003 I know. But nothing my number one assistant can't handle.
124005 Dear Princess Celestia,
124005 This is Spike, writing to you about my adventures. This week I've learned that being jealous and telling lies gets you nowhere in friendship. I also learned that there's plenty of love for every friend to share. So from here on out, I promise, that I, Spike, will... [drops asleep]
124003 Oh, Spike.
1240c3 Hoo?
124003 Who? Spike! You kno... Ohhhh... [giggle]
124000 [music]
124000 [credits]
125000 [knocking]
125003 Oh! Hi, Pinkie Pie.
125007 [Pinkie Pie]
125007 This is your singing telegram
125007 I hope it finds you well
125007 You're invited to a party
125007 'Cause we think you're really swell
125007 Gummy's turning one year old
125007 So help us celebrate
125007 The cake will be delicious
125007 The festivities first-rate
125007 There will be games and dancing
125007 Bob for apples, cut a rug [pop]
125007 And when the party's over
125007 We'll gather 'round for a group hug
125000 [Slowing down]
125000 No need to bring a gift
125000 Being there will be enough
125000 Birthdays mean having fun with friends
125000 Not getting lots of stuff
125000 [Breathing heavily]
125000 It won't be the same without you
125000 So we hope that you say yes
125000 So, please, oh please R.S.V.P.
125000 And come, and be our guest!
125007 [rasping voice] Next time, I think I'll just pass out written invitations.
125000 [theme song]
125000 [music]
12500c Nice one! Now, let me show you how it's really done.
125007 Hey, girls!
12500c Hey, Pinkie Pie!
125008 Howdy!
125007 [squeal] Just wanted to tell you how happy I am that you could make it to Gummy's party.
125008 Are you kiddin'? I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
12500c Me neither. When Pinkie Pie throws a party, I am there! Ta-da!
125007 Aw, it's just a boring old apple. Don't worry, there are plenty of other surprises in there.
12500c [spits] What kind of surprises?
125007 I can't tell you that, silly. Then it wouldn't be a surprise.
125008 [laughs]
12500d This punch is simply divine. Is this the same recipe you used for your "Spring Has Sprung" party?
125007 Nope! Something new.
12500d [spits]
125007 It's Gummy's favorite.
12500d [gulp]
125007 Ooh, this is my jam!
12500d [spits]
125007 Having fun?
125003 A blast!
12500e You always throw the best parties, Pinkie Pie.
125007 They're always the best parties 'cause my best friends are always there!
125003 Yah!
12500e [yelp]
125007 C'mon, everypony! Gummy wants to dance! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday! Go, Gummy! It's your birthday!
125008 Hoo-wee! I am beat! I haven't danced that much since... Well, since your last party. Thanks again for the invite!
12500c See ya later, birthday alligator!
12500d Bravo for hosting yet another delightful soiree.
12500e It's been lovely.
125007 You sure you don't wanna stay? There's still some cake left.
125003 Uh, I think I'm gonna pass. Great party though. We should do this again soon.
125007 [gasp] We should do this again soon!
125000 [knocking]
125003 Oh! Hi, Pinki-
125007 It's soon!
125003 Pardon me?
125007 You said we should have another party soon, and... it's soon! Here's your invitation!
125003 "You're invited to Gummy's 'after-birthday' party. This afternoon at 3 o'clock."
125007 All our bestest friends are invited, and there's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
125003 This afternoon? As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?
125007 Yes, indeedy!
125003 Oh, gosh. I wish I could make it, but I've gotten a bit behind in my studies. I've really gotta hit the books.
125007 I understand. Your studies come first. But don't worry, we'll be sure to save you some cake.
125003 Please do.
125007 Oh! And Twilight, you shouldn't hit the books. You should really just read them.
125003 I'll keep that in mind.
125008 Huh? Oh, hi, Pinkie Pie! What brings you 'round these parts?
125007 Who's ready to shake their hoof-thang?! It's an invitation to Gummy's "after-birthday" party this afternoon. There's gonna be dancing, and games, and cake, and ice-cream, and punch!
125008 This afternoon? A-as in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?
125007 That's funny. That's just what Twilight said, and the answer is, "Yes! It's this afternoon!"
125008 Uh, well, I... I... uh... I don't think I can make it 'cause... uh... I have to... uh... uh, you know what, I... uh... pick apples! Yep, apples! 'Cause that's what we do! With the... apples. We, uh... pick 'em!
125000 [pause]
125008 [gulp]
125007 Okey-dokey-lokey! A party is still a party, even if there are only three guests.
125008 [sigh]
125005 [grunts] Anything else I can do for you, most beautiful one?
12500d [sniff] [whimper] Hmm... perhaps you could take a bath. How do I put this delicately? You smell like a rotten apple core that's been wrapped in moldy hay and dipped in dragon perspiration.
125005 [sigh]
12500d Ooh! Love the new hat. Very modern. What's the occasion?
125007 Gummy's "after-birthday" party is this afternoon. I'm delivering the invitations.
12500d The party is this afternoon? As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon?
125007 It's so strange. Everypony keeps saying that.
12500d Oh... do they?
125007 I know it's short notice, but we had such a great time at his birthday party, I thought we could have even more fun at his after-birthday party.
12500d And I'm sure that we would, but I'm going to have to decline. I have to... wash my hair!
125007 Don't be silly, your hair doesn't look dirty.
12500d It doesn't?
125007 Nope!
12500d See? [gag] Dirty! I have to go!
125007 Huh... No Twilight, no Applejack, no Rarity. Oh well, a party is still a party even with only two guests.
12500c This afternoon?
12500e As in...?
125007 Yes! As in, "this afternoon" this afternoon!
12500c Oh, man! We'd love to, but... we're... house-sitting this afternoon.
125007 [sigh] Both of you?
12500e It's... uh... a big house.
12500c Uh, look at the time! We'd really better get going.
125007 Wait! Maybe I could bring you some after-birthday cake and ice-cream. Who're you house-sitting for?
12500c Harry.
125007 Harry?
12500c Yeah, I don't think you know him.
125007 That's strange. I know just about everypony around here.
12500e He's... a bear.
125007 A bear?
12500c Yup! He's a bear all right, and he'll be pretty upset if we don't get over to his house soon.
125007 Wait! There's a bear around here who lives in a house?
12500e It's, uh, really more of a cave.
12500c But he's fixed up the place so much, it feels like a house.
12500e And, uh, he wants us to look after his house... uh, cave... while he's, uh...
12500c A-at the beach!
125007 He's vacationing at the beach?
12500c Yup! He loves to...
12500e Fluttershy:
12500e Collect sea shells!
12500e ...Play beach volleyball!
12500e ...Collect volleyballs!
12500c Rainbow Dash:
12500c Play beach volleyball!
12500c ...Collect sea shells!
12500c ...Play sea shells!
12500c Gotta go!
125007 Something strange is definitely going on around here, Gummy. Sure Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to house-sit for that vacationing bear, but what are the chances all my other friends would have plans this afternoon too? Rarity has to wash her hair? Applejack has to pick apples? Twilight is behind on her studies and has to hit the books? The more I think about it, the more those are starting to sound like... [gasp] excuses!
125000 [door closes]
125007 That doesn't look like studying... or hitting!
125000 [bell rings]
12502a Ooh! You must be here for...
125003 Shh! Is Pinkie Pie around?
12502a Oh, I don't think so.
125003 Good. I don't wanna her to know anything about this.
12502a Yes, of course. I'll be right back.
125007 But... we're friends. What wouldn't Twilight want me to know anything about? [gasp] She's coming back.
12502a [muffled] There you go!
125003 [muffled] Thanks, and remember, not a word to Pinkie Pie. Hey! What's with the tin can? [yelp]
125007 Time to get to the bottom of things! [gasp] I think our cover's been blown! We'll need a new disguise.
125000 [doorbell rings]
12500d She didn't see you at the sweet shop, did she?
125003 I don't think so.
12500d Oh, good. I'd hate for her to ruin everything.
125003 Me too.
1250c6 [sneeze]
12500d Have you seen her?
12500e Not since this morning.
12500d Me neither. Can you believe she was planning on throwing an after-birthday party today?
12500e I'm just glad I was able to come up with an excuse for why I couldn't be there.
12500d Me too! This is obviously going to be so much better.
12500e As long as we keep her from finding out about it, it will.
12500d [whispering] See you later!
12500e [gasp] [scream]
125007 I thought everypony loved my parties.
12500c Hi, Pinkie Pie! Uh-oh!
125007 Rainbow Dash! Wait!
12500c Phew...
125007 Where're you going?!
12500c [gasp]
125007 What's the real reason you didn't want to come to Gummy's party?!
125000 [bell ringing]
12500c [grunt]
125007 What's in the bag?!
12500c Applejack! We have a problem!
125008 [gasp]
125000 [pounding]
125007 I know you're IN THERE!
125008 Oh! Howdy, pardner!
125007 Mind if I... take a look inside the barn?
125008 No! Uh, I mean, yes, I mean... you can't come in here!
125007 Rainbow Dash just went in there.
125008 Oh, well, she was just bringin' in some... supplies! Yup, supplies for the... renovation! Fixin' up the whole thing, top to bottom... uh, lots of construction goin' on in there right now.
12500c [whispering] You heard her! Construction!
125000 [ponies mimicking noises of various construction tools]
125008 Yup! Construction! That's my story, and I'm stickin' to it. [nervous laugh] [gulp]
125000 [pause]
125007 Okey... dokey... lokey.
125008 [relieved sigh]
125024 [relieved sigh]
125007 Secrets and lies! It's all secrets and lies with those ponies! They're up to something, Gummy! Something they don't want me to know about! Well, I'm gonna know about it! I'm gonna know about it big time! And I know just who's gonna tell me all about it. Tell me all about it big time!
125005 Wow! Nice spread!
125007 It's all yours, Spike. All you have to do is talk.
125005 That's it? Oh, you got it. Okay... uh, beautiful weather we're having, eh? I love a sunny spring day, don't you? The birds chirpin' and the flowers bloomin'.
125007 No, no, no. Talk about our friends.
125005 Oh, okay. Let's see, there's Twilight Sparkle. She's a unicorn. Good with magic. A real brainiac. And then you got Rarity. Total knockout. Twilight seems to think I don't even have a chance with her, but... eh, what does she know? Let's see. There's... there's Fluttershy, a Pegasus who's afraid of heights. Heh, what's up with that?
125007 Grr! No! You're not understanding me! I want you to confess!
125005 Confess?
125007 Confess!
125005 I'm the one who spilled juice all over Twilight's copy of "Magical Mysteries and Practical Potions"!
125007 And?
125005 And I'm the one who used up all the hot water in Ponyville yesterday when I took a seven-hour bubble bath!
125007 Aaand?
125005 And sometimes... when no one's around... I do this - Lookin' good, Spike! Lookin' real good!
125007 No! No! No! No!
125005 W-What do you wanna hear? Tell me what you want me to say, and I'll say it!
125007 Tell me that my friends are all lying to me and avoiding me because they don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore! [panting]
125005 Your friends are all lying to you and avoiding you 'cause they don't like your parties and they don't want to be your friends anymore!
125007 Aha! I knew it! Oh no... My friends don't like my parties and they don't want to be my friends anymore.
125005 Uh, so... [chewing]
125007 [sigh]
125007 Thank you all so much for coming! It means so much to Gummy.
1250c7 Could I have some more punch?
125007 Well, of course you can have some more punch, Mr Turnip.
1250c8 This is one great pahty! You really outdone yourself!
125007 Why, thank you, Rocky.
1250c9 I'm having a delightful time as well.
125007 I'm so glad, Sir Lintsalot.
1250ca Might I trouble you for anozer slice of cake?
125007 Anything for you, Madame le Flour.
1250cb I'm just glad none o' them ponies showed up.
125007 Oh, they're not so bad.
1250cc Not so bad? Puh-lease! They're a buncha losers!
125007 Oh, c'mon now. "Losers" might be a little strong, dont'cha think?
1250cd After the way they treated you? I say "losers" isn't strong enough.
125007 Well, it was pretty rude...
1250ce Pretty rude? It was downright deespicable!
125007 It was, wasn't it?
1250cf If I were you, I wouldn't speak to them ever again.
125007 You know what? I'm not gonna speak to them ever again. And I'm not gonna invite them to another party as long as I live! They don't deserve to be invited to my parties. Not after the way they've been acting.
1250ce [clapping] Deespicable!
1250cd Such losers!
1250ce Yes, zat's right.
1250d0 Well done.
1250d1 Yeah!
1250cb You show 'em!
125000 [knocking]
125007 Who could that be?
12500c Hey there, Pinkie Pie! Sorry I was in such a rush earlier. Had some place to be and couldn't slow down and say, "Hello." You know how it goes.
125007 I know how it goes, all right!
12500c Yeah... so, why don't you come with me over to Sweet Apple Acres?
125007 No thanks. I'm spending time with my real friends. Isn't that right, Madame le Flour?
1250d2 Oui! Zat iz correct, madame.
12500c Uh... Pinkie Pie?
125007 Another slice of cake, Sir Lintsalot?
1250d1 I'd love one.
12500c Aaallrighty. What do you say we get on out of Creepytown and head over to Applejack's...
1250d0 She's not going anywhere.
125007 I most certainly am not. I'm having a wonderful time right here.
12500c You should really just come with me.
1250cb You heard the lady! She ain't goin' nowheres, chump!
12500c Who you calling a chump, chump?! Ugh... That's it. Party's over. Come on, Pinkie Pie.
125007 No.
12500c Pinkie Pie, let's go!
125007 I said no!
12500c You... [grunts] have to... come with... me!
125007 No... I... don't!
125000 [crash]
12500c Oh, you wanna do this the hard way?! We'll do this the hard way!
12500c [grunting] [panting] We're... here...
1250d3 [in unison] Surprise!
12500e I really thought she'd be more excited.
125007 Excited? Excited?! Why would I be excited to attend my own farewell party?!
125003 Farewell party?
125007 Yes! You don't like me anymore, so you decided to kick me out of the group and throw a great, big party to celebrate! A "Farewell to Pinkie Pie" party!
125008 Why in the world would you think we didn't like you anymore, sugarcube?
125007 Why? Why? Why?! Because you've been lying to me and avoiding me all day, that's why!
12500c Uh, yeah, because we wanted your party to be a surprise.
12500d We've been planning this party for such a long time, we had to make excuses for why we couldn't attend Gummy's party so that we could get everything ready for yours.
125003 If this is a farewell party, why does the cake I picked up from Sugarcube Corner say "Happy Birthday, Pinkie Pie"?
125007 Because it's my birthday! Ooh, how could I have forgotten my own birthday?
1250d4 [sigh]
125007 And you like me so much you decided to throw me a surprise party!
12500d That's what we've been trying to tell you, darling.
125007 You girls are the best friends ever! How could I have ever doubted you?
125003 It's okay, Pinkie Pie. It could have happened to any of us.
12500c Uh-huh! It sure would.
12500e Don't worry about it.
12500c I'm just glad I haven't been replaced by a bucket of turnips.
125003 Huh?
12500c You don't wanna know.
125008 All right, girls! Enough of this gab. Let's party!
125000 [music]
125003 Dear Princess Celestia,
125003 I am writing to you from the most delightful party. I'm not only having a great time with my friends, but also was given the opportunity to learn a valuable lesson about friendship. Always expect the best from your friends, and never assume the worst. Rest assured that a good friend always has your best interests at heart.
125003 Your faithful student,
125003 Twilight Sparkle
125007 You girls wouldn't mind if we celebrated Gummy's after-birthday party too, would you? His party was cut short, and he's pretty upset about it.
12500e Oh, definitely.
12500d Aww, he was upset?
125008 Uh-huh, sure!
12500c For Gummy, yeah!
125003 Yeah, why not? Let's have a party for Gummy. [giggles]
125000 [music]
125000 [credits]
126007 Ahh! I... can't... believe... the Grand... Galloping... Gala... is... tonight!
126003 Pinkie, please stop shouting! I'm trying to concentrate!
12600d Pinkie Pie! Stop that right now. It's time to prepare for the Gala, and I refuse to let you put on your new dress when you're all sweaty.
126007 What's Twilight doing?
126005 She's got an awesome magic spell she's been working on for the Gala.
12600d Where are the others? It's getting late.
126008 Hold your horses, girl. We're here.
126003 Perfect. I'm ready!
12600c For what?
126003 All right, Spike.
126007 An apple! Are we having pie?
126005 Shh! Watch!
126048 [Awesome! Wow! Lovely!]
126003 Thanks, but that's just the start. Fluttershy, did you bring your friends?
12600e Yes. Will they be safe, Twilight?
126003 You have my word. Ta-da!
12601f [Oh. Uh. Ah. That's a choice. Interesting.]
126003 Neat, huh? And don't worry, they'll be mice again at midnight.
12600e Opalescence, no!
12606a [meows]
126000 [neighing]
126003 Wait! Come back! Those horses were supposed to pull our carriage. How will we get to the Gala?
12600d [sarcastically] Whatever shall we do?
12600d Uh... ahem. Excuse me. Uh, would you boys mind pulling our carriage to the Gala?
126003 Oh. Yeah. Right.
126000 [theme song]
126007 Ooo-aah!
126000 [crash]
126005 [moan] [knocks door] Come on, you guys. Let me in!
12600c Sure thing, Spike.
12600d Heavens no, we're getting dressed!
126008 Dressed? Uh, beg pardon, Rarity, but, uh... we don't normally wear clothes.
12600d [moan] I'm sorry, Spike. Some of us do have standards.
126005 I still can't believe we're gonna be at Canterlot tonight. Our hometown, Twilight! And the best part is that we all get to hang out together all night long!
12600c Uh... I-I don't know, Spike.
12600d We'll just have to see.
126008 [spits] We're gonna be a mite busy.
126007 Busy having fun! [boing]
126005 Oh... okay.
126003 Don't worry, Spike. We'll all get to spend some time together.
126005 Great!
126005 'Cause I planned out my insider's tour of Canterlot. I've gotta show Rarity the crown jewels, and Applejack the Princess's golden apple tree. And Pinkie, we gotta go to my favorite donut shop.
126000 [excited chatter inside carriage]
126005 Then let's get moving! Hyah!
126059 Excuse me?!
126005 Um... I...
1260d5 If you weren't friends with our neighbor Rarity... Hmph.
126005 Whoa! You all look... amazing!
126003 I can't believe we're finally here. With all that we've imagined, the reality of this night is sure to make this... The Best Night Ever!

126003 Princess Celestia!
126019 Twilight! It is so lovely to see my star student.
126003 Oh, I'm so excited to be here! We have so much to catch up on.
126019 Well, I want you right by my side the entire evening, so we'll have plenty of time together.
126003 That's just what I was hoping you'd say.
12600d [gasp] [squeals of excitement] Hurry, Rarity... oh, but not too fast. But don't wanna lose him... wait! Have to play it cool. Oh, but don't be cold! I can't lose him, I can't! He's everything I imagined! Even better than I imagined.
126000 [bird chirping]
12600e Oh my! A meadowlark!
126000 [whistling]
12600e I think she's calling to me. It's exactly what I wished for! [humming]
126000 [whistling]
126008 Howdy, partner! You hungry?
12607b As a horse!
126008 Well, what'cha hankering for? Caramel apple? Apple pie? Apple fritter? Apple fries?
12607b I'll take that big apple pie!
126008 Well, thank you kindly, sir! Yee-haw! In the first minute, I made my first sale. Just like I expected.
12607c Always hungry after a show. Eh, Soarin?
12607b Heh. Yeah! [gasp] My pie! You saved it. Thanks.
12600c Hey, no prob.
12607c Hey! I know you. You're the pony that saved us in Cloudsdale and won The Best Flyer Competition.
12600c Hay yeah! Name's Rainbow Dash.
12607c Well, Rainbow Dash. Looks like your skills saved us again. Oh, well, at least they saved Soarin's apple pie.
12607b [eating noisily] Yeah...
12607c Wanna come hang out with us?
12600c Sure. Why not? I'm... hanging... with the... Wonderbolts! [squee, giggle]
126007 The shiny dance floor... the pretty party ponies... ooh, the fancy band... shiny! Pretty! Fancy! [anxious noise] Gotta dance!
126007 [Pinkie Pie]
126007 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
126007 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
126007 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala
126007 It's all I ever dreamed
126007 It's all I ever dreamed, woo hoo!
126007 It's all I ever dreamed, yippee!
126007 I'm at the Grand Galloping GalaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAA!
126007 It's all I've ever... dreamed?
1260d6 Well, hello. I am Prince Blueblood.
12600d I am... Rarity. Oh my, what a lovely rose.
1260d6 You mean... this rose? Thank you. It goes with my eyes.
12600d [moan]
12600e [humming]
126000 [whistling]
12600e [gasp] My little meadowlark is right around this bend!
1260d7 [whistling]
12600e Was that you?
1260d7 Yep! I love whistlin' while I work. [whistles]
12600e Oh! Yes... well... e-excuse me.
126000 [animal noises]
12600e Oh! I see a toco toucan! And a spider monkey! [gasp] And, oh! Is that a wallaroo? Oh, Fluttershy. You're such a loudmouth.
126000 [ponies chattering]
12600c Hey, Spitfire! You ever done a rain cloud double backflip? [to Soarin] You ever soared past lightning? It's awesome!
126019 Welcome to the Grand Galloping Gala.
126003 Princess! I've been so excited to spend time with you and—
126019 Yes. Me too, Twi— oh, good evening! Welcome to the Gala. Which is why I— ladies! Lovely to see you again.
126003 [sigh] Looks like getting a chance to talk to the Princess is gonna be a magic trick in itself.
126008 First minute, first sale. Second... fourth... sixth... sixtieth minute... no sales. [sigh] This ain't what I expected at all.
126007 I'm at the Grand Galloping Gala... and it's not what I dreamed.
12600d This isn't at all what I imagined.
126019 [in background] Good evening! So nice to see you. Welcome!
126003 This isn't what I hoped.
12600c This isn't hanging out.
12600e This isn't what I wished for.
126003 No!
12600d I waited all my life...
12600e ...for this moment...
126007 ...and I'm not going to...
126008 ...let it slip by.
12600c If it's the last thing I do...
126003 ...I'm gonna make this...
126012 ...the best night ever!
12600e I just have to be more bold, like Twilight says. [loudly] I'm so sorry to have scared you, my friends! But I'm leaving now, so you can all come out!
126000 [crunching]
12600e Gotcha! It's okay. I promise not to hurt you. I just wanna be your... friend?
1260d7 Mmm... sounds good to me.
12600c Come on, Rainbow! If they don't notice you, you gotta make 'em notice you. [whistles]
1260ae [yells] [grunts]
12600d Just give him a chance, Rarity. His princely side is sure to come out if you're just patient.
1260d6 Miss Rarity! Stop!
12600d Oh. Prince Blueblood! How chivalrous.
1260d6 One would hate to slip.
12600d Yes. One certainly would.
1260d6 One's cloak should take care of the problem.
12600d Oh, of course it will.
126007 [gasp] [whispering] C'mon, everypony! I know what will make you shake those groove-thangs!
126007 [Pinkie Pie]
126007 You reach your right hoof in
126007 You reach your right hoof out
126007 You reach your right hoof in
126007 And you shake it all about
126007 You do the Pony Pokey meeting lots of folks with clout
126007 That's what I'm talking about
126007 You step your left hoof in
126007 You pull it right back out
126007 You step your left hoof in
126007 But you better help him out
126007 You do the Pony Pokey but should find a different route
126007 That's what it's all about
126007 You kick your back left in
126007 You pull your back left out
126007 You reach your back left in
126007 Just be brave and have no doubt
126007 You do the Pony Pokey feeling like you're gonna pout
126007 That's what I'm singing about
126007 You tilt your head in
126007 You tilt your head out
126007 You tilt your head in
126007 Then you shake it all about
126007 You do the Pony Pokey even though your date's a lout
126007 You're better off without
126007 You stomp your whole self in
126007 You stomp your whole self out
126007 You stomp your whole self in
126007 And you stomp yourself about
126007 You do the Pony Pokey and you give a little shout-
12600e COME OUT!
126007 [Pinkie Pie]
126007 That's what I'm talking about
126007 You do the Pony Pokey
126007 You do the Pony Pokey
126007 You do the Pony Pokey
126007 And that's what it's all about
126007 Yeah!
126095 Young lady, this is not that kind of party.
126007 Ohhhhhh... they don't want a party. These ponies want a paaartay!
12600d Two apple fritters, please.
126008 Two apple fritters comin' right up. That'll be four bits.
12600d Ahem.
1260d6 Ahem.
12600d Ahem!
1260d6 Ahem!
12600d [sigh] I'm going to have to pay, aren't I?
126008 It's okay, Rarity. I got you covered.
12600d Thank you, Applejack. At least somepony here has good manners.
1260d6 [gags] Oh! Fritters! Dumplings! Caramel apples! My royal lips have touched common carnival fare! I'm going to the buffet for some... hors d'oeuvres.
126008 Well, no wonder nopony wants my food. They're fillin' up on those fancy-schmancy vittles. Well, my down-home apples are plenty good enough for this crowd. I'll just dress 'em up a bit and prove it to 'em.
12600e I'll catch you yet, my pretties. Oh yes. As soon as one of you little birds or monkeys or bears touches this net... you'll be mine! Mine! [evil laugh] Whoa!
126007 Come on, everypony! You wanted a partay? Now it's paaartaaay! Yeah! Uh! Now that's a beat, yeah! Uh! C'mon, dance! Yeah, woohoo!
126008 Okay, all you high-class ponies. Here's a highfalutin apple cake for your hoity-toity taste buds.
126007 Stage dive!
1260d8 [scream]
12600d [angry growl] You, sir, are the most uncharming prince I have ever met! In fact, the only thing royal about you is that you are a royal pain!
1260d6 Ewww...! Uh, stay back! I just had myself groomed!
12600d Afraid to get dirty?! [babbles]
1260d6 [whimpering]
12600c This is my chance! Yes! Whoa!
126000 [crash]
126003 Well... it can't get any worse.
126000 [rumbling]
126000 [door opens]
126000 [animals chattering]
12600e You're... going to love me!
126000 [ponies screaming]
126003 Um, um, uh, eugh...
126019 Run.
126003 [whistles]
126007 Ooh! Rarity, your glass slipper! Now your prince is sure to find you.
12600d [shriek] No! Ugh! Let's go!
126005 Hey, Pony Joe. Another donut.
1260d9 Don't you think you've had enough?
126005 Another donut! Extra sprinkles!
126000 [bell rings]
1260d9 Twilight Sparkle, ha ha! Long time no see.
126005 Hey, how was the Gala? How was your best night ever?
126005 That sounds like the worst night ever!
1260da It was! [laughter]
126003 I just hope Princess Celestia isn't upset with us for ruining the Gala.
126019 That was the best Grand Galloping Gala ever!
126012 Princess Celestia!
126003 Pardon me, Princess, but tonight was just awful.
126019 Oh, Twilight. The Grand Galloping Gala is always awful.
126003 It is?
126019 That is why I was thrilled you were all attending. I was hoping you could liven things up a bit. And while the evening may not have gone as you planned, I'm sure you'll agree that in the end it didn't turn out so bad for this group of friends.
126003 You're right, Princess. Friends have a way of making even the worst of times into something pretty great.
12600c Yeah! Hanging out with friends!
12600e Talking!
126007 Laughing!
126005 You mean doing exactly what I wanted to do the whole time?
126003 Yes, Spike. You were right.
126008 As horrible as our night was...
12600d ...being together here has made it all better.
126007 In fact, it's made it...
126012 ...the best night ever!
12604d [laughter]
126000 [music]
126000 [credits]
20105b I want to start our field trip here, in the world-famous Canterlot sculpture garden. That one over there represents friendship. Alright, my little ponies. This one represents victory.
201065 How cool would it be to have that for a cutie mark?
20100a Cool, if you were actually victoryful at somethin'.
201066 That's not a word!
201065 What are you, a dictionary?
20105b Girls! Now this is a really interesting statue. What do you notice about it?
20100a It's got an eagle claw!
201065 And a lion paw!
201066 And a snake tail!
20105b This creature is called a draconequus. He has the head of a pony and a body made up of all sorts of things. What do you suppose that represents?
20100a Confusion!
201066 Evil!
201065 Chaos!
201066 It's not chaos, you dodo!
201065 Don't call me things I don't know the meaning of! And it is too chaos!
201066 Is not!
20100a You're both wrong!
201080 [grunting]
201000 [pulsating]
20105b Actually, in a way, you're all right. This statue represents discord, which means a lack of harmony between ponies. In fact, you three have demonstrated discord so well that you're each going to write me an essay explaining it.
201074 [laughter]
20105b Now let's go, and I don't want anymore fighting.
20100a It's confusion!
201066 Evil!
201065 Chaos!
201000 [stone cracking]
2010db [laughter]
201000 [theme song]
20100c Come back here, you! Gotcha! Eww, what is this? Cotton candy?
201000 [thunder rumbles]
201000 [drip]
20100c Wait a second! It's not supposed to rain until tomorrow. You can't just–
201000 [rain falling]
20100c You did.
20100c Hey, I didn't tell you to go anywhere!
201008 Rainbow Dash, what's goin' on with this rain? I mean chocolate milk? I mean chocolate milk rain?!
20100c There's crazy weather all over Equestria! Cloudsdale is getting soaked by a major cola storm right now! But don't worry. I'm not leaving you until I get control of Ponyville!
201000 [popping]
201007 Why would you wanna stop this? [slurp]
20100d Ahem. I heard about your troubles, Applejack, and I came to see if there's anything I can do without getting wet. Or dirty. Or out from under my umbrella.
201000 [wood creaking]
201008 Fluttershy! Do somethin'!
20100e Now, Angel, you really shouldn't– No! It's not possible! I must be seeing things!
201003 Don't worry, everyone. I've learned a new spell that'll fix everything. My fail-safe spell... failed. What do we do?
201005 Uh, give up?
20100d Spike, Twilight will come up with something.
201003 Hmm, time for plan B. Rainbow, can you corral all those clouds in one corner of the sky? Applejack, I need you to bring those high-strung storm clouds down to Earth.
201007 Hey, what happened?
201003 [whispers]
20100e Oh dear. I hope none of the animals see these delicious chocolate-filled cotton candy clouds. I'd hate to have to share them.
201007 You and me both, sister! Hey!
201008 And when y'all are done with that, feel free to have some popcorn for dessert.
201003 You see, Spike? You should never give up. There's nothing we can't overcome if we all work together.
201005 [burp]
201003 [gasp] Come on, girls. Princess Celestia wants to see us all in Canterlot immediately!
201003 Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could!
201019 Thank you, Twilight. Thank you, all.
201003 Is this about the weather? And the animals' weird behavior? What's happening out there? Why isn't my magic working? Is there–
201019 Follow me.
201019 I've called you here for a matter of great importance. It seems an old foe of mine, someone I thought I had defeated long ago, has returned. His name... is Discord.
20100e [squeal]
201019 Discord is the mischievous spirit of disharmony. Before my sister and I stood up to him, he ruled Equestria in an eternal state of unrest and unhappiness. Luna and I saw how miserable life was for Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns alike, so after discovering the Elements of Harmony, we combined our powers and rose up against him, turning him to stone.
20100c Alright, Princess!
201019 I thought the spell we cast would keep him contained forever, but since Luna and I are no longer connected to the Elements, the spell has been broken.
201003 No longer connected?
201019 This is Canterlot Tower, where the Elements are kept inside since all of you recovered them. I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord before he thrusts all of Equestria into eternal chaos.
201003 But why us? Why don't you–
201007 Hey, look! We're famous!
201019 You six showed the full potential of the Elements by harnessing the magic of your friendship to beat a mighty foe. Although Luna and I once wielded the Elements, it is you who now control their power, and it is you who must defeat Discord!
201003 Princess Celestia, you can count on–
201007 Hold on a second! Eternal chaos comes with chocolate rain, you guys. Chocolate rain.
201003 Don't listen to her, Princess. We'd be honored to use the Elements of Harmony again.
20100d Ooh. You can keep the Elements. I'll take that case!
201019 Have no fear, ponies. I have total confidence that you will be able to defeat Discord with these!
20104d [gasp]
201007 Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be outside in the chocolate puddles with a giant swizzle straw.
201003 The Elements! They're gone!
201019 That chamber is protected by a powerful spell that only I can break! This doesn't make sense!
2010db [laughter] Make sense? Oh, what fun is there in making sense?
201019 Discord... Show yourself!
2010db [chuckling] Did you miss me, Celestia? I missed you. It's quite lonely being encased in stone, but you wouldn't know that, would you? Because I don't turn ponies into stone.
201019 Enough! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
2010db Oh, I just borrowed them for a teensy little while. [snap]
201019 You'll never get away with this, Discord!
2010db Oh, I'd forgotten how grim you can be, Celestia. It's really quite boring.
20100c Hey! Nopony insults the Princess!
201000 [smack]
2010db Oh, you must be Rainbow Dash, famed for her loyalty, the Element of Harmony you represent.
20100c That's right! I'll always be loyal to the Princess!
2010db We'll see about that.
20100d I can't believe we're wasting our time talking to a tacky window.
2010db The beautiful Rarity, representing the element of generosity, if I'm not mistaken?
201008 So you know who we are, big deal.
2010db Oh, I know much more than that, honest Applejack.
201003 You seem to know our strengths too.
2010db Yes, Twilight Sparkle, and yours is the most powerful and elusive element, magic. Fluttershy's is kindness and Pinkie Pie's is a personal favorite of mine - laughter. [laughter]
201007 [snickering]
201003 Pinkie!
201007 [laughing] He's standing on your head!
201019 Stop stalling, Discord! What have you done with the Elements of Harmony?
2010db Oh, so boring, Celestia. Really? Fine, I'll tell you, but I'll only tell you my way. To retrieve your missing Elements, just make sense of this change of events. Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began. [laughing]
20100e Can we go home now?
201008 What do you reckon he meant? Twists and turns and endin' back where we started?
201003 Twists and turns... twists and turns... twists and turns! That's it! I bet Discord hid the Elements in the palace labyrinth!
201019 Good luck, my little ponies. The fate of Equestria is in your hooves.
201003 Thanks, Princess. We won't let you down.
2010db [laughing]
201012 [gasp]
20100e W-We have to go in there?
20100c Nope! Dopey Discord forgot about these babies! I'll just do a quick flyover and we'll have the Elements in no time. My wings!
20100e [scream]
2010dc Your horn! My horn! Ahhh!
2010db [laughing] You–You should see the looks on your faces. Priceless! [laughing]
201003 Give us our wings and horns back!
2010db You'll get them back in good time. I simply took them to ensure there's no cheating. You see, this is the first rule of our game - no flying, and no magic.
20100c The first rule?
2010db The second rule is everypony has to play or the game is over, and I win. Good luck, everypony! [laughing]
201003 Never fear, girls. We have each other!
20100c Yeah! Like Twilight said, there's nothing we can't overcome if we all stick together!
201003 Alright, girls, let's do this!
201012 Together! [screaming]
201003 Stay calm, girls! Everypony head to the middle as fast as you can, and we'll regroup there!
20100c Moving out!
20100d See you in the center.
201008 Yee-haw!
201007 See you guys there!
20100e [gasping] What's that? Who's there? Girls!
201008 What in tarnation? Where am I?
2010dd [laughing]
201008 Who are y'all?
2010de The keepers of the grove of truth. You may ask us...
2010df ...one question...
2010e0 ...past, future or present.
2010de But be warned...
2010df ...that the truth...
2010e0 ...may not always be pleasant.
201008 Alright then. I don't trust this place worth a hill of beans, but I've got a really bad feelin' about this feller Discord. What's gonna come of this mission we're on?
2010de For the answer you seek...
2010df ...go ahead, take a peek.
2010e1 I hope I never see you again!
2010e2 Me too!
2010e3 Fine!
2010e4 Fine!
2010e5 It's settled then.
201008 No! Our friendship? Over?!
2010db [chuckling]
201008 It can't be true. It just can't!
201008 That just can't be the truth.
2010df When all the truth does...
2010e0 ...is make your heart ache...
2010e6 ...sometimes a lie is easier to take. [laughing]
201003 Applejack! Thank goodness! I thought I heard voices over here. Who were you talking to?
201008 I was talkin' to... uh... nopony! Nopony whatsoever!
201003 What?
201008 Nothing. Come on, uh, we best be going.
201003 Did Applejack just...? Come on, Twilight! Applejack wouldn't lie.
201007 [whistling]
2010e7 [sing-song laughter]
201007 [chuckling] Whee! This is the greatest balloon garden I've ever seen! It's the first balloon garden I've ever seen, but still! Wah! [splash]
2010e7 [laughing]
201007 Hey, what gives?
2010db What's the matter, Pinkie Pie? I thought you appreciated a good laugh.
201007 It's different. They're laughing at me.
2010db It's hardly different. Your friends laugh at you all the time.
201007 My friends laugh with me, not at me.
2010db Oh, really? [laughing]
201007 No! Stop it!
2010e7 [laughing]
201007 Stop laughing at me!
2010db Oh, poor Pinkie Pie. And here I thought laughter made you happy.
201007 [gravelly] Happy? I don't think so.
201000 [balloons popping]
201003 Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
201007 Oh you are, huh? Why? Need a good laugh?
201003 Pinkie? What do you suppose has her so upset? It's not like her.
201008 I didn't notice anythin' strange about Pinkie.
201003 Weird. Better pick up the pace before the stress of this gets the better of all of us.
20100d I was expecting an audience with the Princess, not outdoor sport. Agh. Oh my...
2010db [laughing] Welcome to your lucky day, Rarity. You've found the one thing in Equestria that could rival my face for sheer beauty. What do you think? You like?
20100d Yes... I like very much... No! No, I shan't succumb to such fabulousness. Must... get to the center... to meet... the others. [grunt] Mine!
20100d Well, Rarity. It took forever, but it was worth it. Who knew three little gemstones would turn out to be this handsome hunk of a diamond? Now to get you home. [grunts]
201000 [wall crash]
201003 Rarity! Are we glad to see... Why are you carrying a humongous boulder?
20100d What do you mean, "boulder"? This big beautiful bedazzling rock is a diamond! And it's all mine. Keep your envious little eyes off it! I found it and it's mine fair and square! [grunting]
20100e [teeth chatter] Okay, I can do this. I can... [scream] Oh, wait a minute... Butterflies? Wait! Don't leave me here!
2010e8 Fluttershy, looks like you've been left behind by your so-called friends, huh?
20100e Oh, no. I'm certain they're doing their best to find me.
2010e8 Well, it must be so upsetting to know how weak and helpless they think you are.
20100e Not at all. I am weak and helpless and I appreciate their understanding.
2010e8 Yes... Well, surely it burns you up... I mean, that they're always pointing out your flaws, right?
20100e Not really. In fact, I think I'm awfully lucky to have friends who want me to be the best I can be.
2010db Oh, for goodness sake! You've been kind for far too long, my dear. Time to be cruel. Arrivederci!
201003 Fluttershy! I'm so glad to see a friendly face. This awful labyrinth is getting to everypony.
201008 Grrr...
201007 [blows raspberry]
20100e Aw, boo-hoo-hoo! Why don't you wave your magic little horn and make everything all right?
201003 Uh...
20100e Oh, that's right, you can't. You don't have one.
201003 What is happening to my friends?
201008 [laughing]
201007 And what are you laughing at?
201008 Chocolate milk.
20100d Little help here! Thanks, Twilight.
201003 You're welcome–
20100d But don't get any ideas about my gem! I know where you live.
201000 [thunder crash]
20100c I've got you now, element.
2010db Oh. I can see why you like these clouds so much. Very plush.
20100c Get off there and put 'em up! Come on! Let's go!
2010db Hey, I'm here to deliver a message.
20100c I've got a message for you too!
2010db Listen closely, this is important. A weighty choice is yours to make - the right selection or a big mistake. If a wrong choice you choose to pursue, the foundations of home will crumble without you.
201000 [thunder] [spinning]
20100c Cloudsdale? Crumble... without me? No!
2010db That box contains your wings. You can take them and leave the game, or you can carry on aimlessly wandering this maze. Your choice.
201003 Must... find... Rainbow Dash. As a team... we're unstoppable. Rainbow Dash won't let us down.
201008 Well, looky there. Rainbow Dash is flying away. She's abandonin' us.
201003 Now I know that's a lie. [gasp] How can it be?
201000 [thunder, cracking]
2010db Well, well, well. Somepony broke the "no wings; no magic" rule. [snap] Game's over, my little ponies. You didn't find your precious elements. [mewl] Looks like we might be due for a big old storm of chaos. [laughter]
201000 [To be continued...]
201000 [music]
201000 [credits]
202000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
202003 Princess Celestia, we came as fast as we could!
202019 I need you to wield the Elements of Harmony once again and stop Discord.
202003 The Elements! They're gone!
2020db [laughter] Everypony has to play, or the game is over and I win.
202008 Our friendship... over?
202003 Who are you talking to?
202008 Nopony! Nopony whatsoever.
202003 What?
202003 Pinkie Pie! Are we glad to see you!
202007 Why? Need a good laugh?
202003 What is happening to my friends?
2020db Looks like we might be due for a big old storm of chaos.
202000 [theme song]
2020db [laughing]
202007 And what are you laughing at?!
2020db Oh, you ponies are just the most fun I've had in eons.
202007 Well, quit it! You'd better think before you laugh at the Pink...ie Pie!
20200e Oh, yeah? Well ha, ha.
202007 Quit it!
20200e No. Ha, ha.
202007 Quit it!
20200e No. Ha ha-ha ha ha.
202008 Uh... Rarity? This here diamond of yours? Twilight said we should split it six ways since we, uh, found it together.
20200d HI-YAH! Try it, punk. He's mine. All mine! Ya! Ya! Ya!
202003 Girls, why are you all acting like this?
202007 Quit it! Stop it!
202003 We need to stick together.
20200e Ha, ha.
2020db [laugh] It's just too entertaining.
202003 Stop it, Discord. You're not playing fair.
2020db I'm not playing fair? Perhaps we haven't met. I'm Discord, spirit of chaos and disharmony. Hello?
202003 How are we supposed to find the Elements of Harmony when you took away the labyrinth before we could get to the end?
2020db Oh, wait, did you...? [laughter] How funny! You thought the Elements were in the labyrinth?
2020e9 Twists and turns are my master plan. Then find the Elements back where you began.
2020db I never said they were in the labyrinth.
202003 But... but...
2020db Keep trying, Twilight Sparkle. Maybe the magic of friendship can help you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some chaos to wreak.
202000 [thunder]
202000 [falling rain]
202007 Chocolate milk? I hate chocolate milk!
202003 [grunt] Think, Twilight, think! "Find the Elements back where you began." Back where you began...
20200d Don't touch my gem!
20200e I'm touching your gem, Rarity. Ha, ha.
202007 What 'chu laughin' at?
202003 Ugh. I just want to go home... Wait a minute... Home! "Back where you began!" The Elements must be in...
202003 ...Ponyville! Come on, girls. I'm certain this is what Discord's riddle really meant. If we get back to the library, I have a book that I just know can give us a clue. Ah!
20200e Good boy, Angel. Mama's so proud.
202008 Wow, I can see so much better now. Whoa! I meant to do that.
202003 Wah! Ahh! Whoa! Discord's turned our dirt roads into soap!
2020db Beautiful, isn't it? This is the new and improved Ponyville, and these are only my first of changes.
202007 This may look like fun, but it's not.
202003 Ugh.
2020db Picture it. The chaos capital of the world.
202003 I can't picture anything. It's too dark. [splash]
2020db Well, wait a few minutes and you'll see it in the beautiful light of day. Or not.
202003 Ponyville, the chaos capital of the world? Not if I have anything to say about it.
20200e Don't worry, you won't. [laugh]
202003 [groan]
202003 [sigh] Okay, we're here. Everyone please, please, please just go inside, please?
202008 I absolutely refuse.
20200e With pleasure.
202007 I hate libraries!
202003 [moan]
20200d [grunting]
202003 Pleeeease, we gotta hurry!
20200d Forget it, Twilight. I know what you're up to. The second I go in, you'll have your little minion Spike come and take Tom!
202003 Tom?
20200d Well, it's not going to work.
202003 You're not going in without him, are you?
20200d Mm-mm.
202003 [grunting] Fine!
202005 [snore]
202000 [splash]
202005 Ah! Brrr! What did you do that for, Fluttershy?
20200e 'Cause you just looked so peaceful.
202005 I, uh... Huh?
202000 [crash]
20200d Careful, Twilight! You'll ruin his beautiful finish.
202003 Oh, for the love of...
202005 Twilight, what's going on? Why does everybody look so... gray?
202003 Don't ask. I need you to help me find something.
20200e Hey, Twilight, what's soaking wet and clueless?
202003 Fluttershy, I've had just about enough—
202000 [splash]
20200e Your face!
202000 [bang]
202005 What's happened to everypony?
202008 I guess you just bring out the worst in us, Spike.
202003 Ugh. No time to explain. We've got to find the reference guide to the Elements of Harmony before somepony does something she'll regret!
202005 The Elements of Harmony? Oh, I know exactly where that book is. Found it!
20200e Hah!
202003 Fluttershy, you'd better give me that book!
20200e Keep away!
202003 Hey! Applejack, give me that book!
202008 I don't have any book.
202003 Pinkie! You guys! Stop it right now!
202005 Ugh!
20200d Mine!
202003 Hey, do you even know what you just stole?
20200d No, but if you want it, I want it!
202003 [strained groan] GIVE ME THAT BOOK!
202000 [smack]
202003 Where is she? Where's Rarity?
202008 Beats me.
202003 Lies!
202000 [cat yowl, fighting noises]
202003 Get back! All of you! This is my book, and I'm going to READ IT! [gasp] The Elements!
202003 The Elements! They were here all along!
202005 This is great! Now you guys can defeat Discord and put everything back to normal!
202003 See, girls? We did it! We found the Elements of Harmony! Together!
202008 [yawn]
202003 You don't even care, do you?
2020ea No.
202003 [sigh] I never thought it would happen. My friends... have turned into complete jerks! Necklace, necklace, necklace, necklace, and... big crown thingy! Come on, everypony, let's go!
202005 But Twilight, aren't you missing somepony?
202003 Nope. We've got the liar, the grump, the hoarder, and the brute. That just about covers it.
202005 But what about Rainbow Dash?
202003 Congratulations, Spike, you're the new Rainbow Dash. Now let's go!
202005 [gasp] Me? B-b-but what if she finds out I've been impersonating her? [moan] That won't end well.
202003 Too bad, you're Rainbow Dash. Now let's go defeat Discord so we don't ever have to talk to each other again!
2020eb Yeah! Woo-hoo!
20200d [grunting]
202003 Move! Look out, here comes Tom!
202000 [crash]
2020db Well, well, well, I see you've found the Elements of Harmony. How terrifying!
202003 Discord! I've figured out your lame riddle. You're in for it now!
2020db I certainly am. You've clearly out-dueled me, and now it's time to meet my fate. I'm prepared to be defeated now, ladies. Fire when ready.
202003 Formation, now!
2020ea Eh.
202003 "Rainbow Dash", get over here.
202005 [gulp]
202003 All right, let's get this over with. What's going on?
202008 Mine's workin'. There must be somethin' wrong with yours.
202007 I HATE the Elements of Harmony!
20200e Hmph! Garbage.
20200d MINE!
202005 Sorry, Twilight. I guess I'd better get back upstairs and clean up the library. Good luck with all this— whoa!
20200e Oops, sorry, Rainbow Crash. [chuckle]
2020db Bravo, ponies, bravo! [clapping, various sounds] Harmony in Equestria is officially dead. Discord rules, Celestia drools. [laughs]
202003 [growl]
202007 It's your fault it didn't work.
202003 Who are you talking to?
202007 Any of you! ALL OF YOU! I'm outta here!
202008 I better go, too. I've got new better friends waiting for me at the farm.
20200e Yeah! I'm sick of you losers.
202003 FINE! Leave! See if I care! I don't need you guys either! With friends like you, who needs... enemies...?
2020db [laughing] Oh, my stomach! Twilight, you've got to see what I just did.
202064 [sneeze]
2020db It's priceless! Come now, Twilight Sparkle. You've got to get into the spirit of things! After all, this is your new home.
202003 Not anymore...
2020db YES! [triumphant laugh]
202000 [door closes]
202003 Pack your things, Spike, we're leaving.
202005 [groan]
202003 Don't ask where we're going, 'cause I don't know yet. Just not here.
202005 Can't... move... The princess... has been sending these... since I came back upstairs. [belch] Make it stop!
202003 These are all the letters I've written to the princess since I've lived in Ponyville. But why would she send them back?
202005 [groan] [belch]
202003 "Real friends don't care what your cover is."
202003 Friendship is a wondrous and powerful thing.
202003 And like the path cut through the orchard, there will always be a way through.
202003 The best thing to do is stay true to yourself.
202003 Everypony has a special magical connection with her friends. Maybe even before she's met them.
202003 Spike! Spike, it's all so clear! Can't you see? Discord's trying to distract us from what's important. He knows how powerful our friendships are, and he's trying to keep us from seeing it. Do you remember what I said the first day we arrived in Ponyville? I told you that the future of Equestria didn't rest on me making friends. But the opposite is true! The friendships I've made since I've been here are what saved Equestria from Nightmare Moon, and now they need to save it from Discord!
202005 [moan]
202003 You're right, Spike. I've got to fight for my friendships. For them. For me. For Equestria!
202005 [moan]
202003 Oh, uh... why don't you just stay here and rest? I'll take care of the whole fighting for friendship thing myself.
202005 [moan] [belch]
202008 And so I tried to defeat Discord, but none of my so-called "friends" would lift a hoof to help me.
202003 Applejack, I'm here to fight for our friendship.
202008 Oh, now you want to fight. Where were you when I was battlin' Discord?
202003 Snap out of it. This isn't you! You're not a liar.
202008 Wh-what happened? Twilight! [sigh] I saw a vision of us feudin' and fightin'. I couldn't face the truth, so I started tellin' lies. Can you ever forgive me?
202003 I already have. Come on!
20200e Oh no! Twilight, Applejack, I just had the worst dream!
20200d What do you think you're doing? Get away from my gem! Get away—! [grunting] Let us never speak of this again.
202007 [laughing] And I-I turned gray! Can you believe it?!
20200e Uh? She's not here.
202003 Without Rainbow Dash, we can't use the Elements.
202008 She could be anywhere by now! We're never gonna find her.
202007 Yeah, we will, 'cause she's right there!
202003 Rainbow Dash!
20200c Hey, guys!
202003 We've been looking everywhere for you!
20200c That's nice.
202003 Discord's still on the loose! We need you to help us defeat him with your element, Loyalty!
20200c Pfft. Loyalty, schmoyalty! Have you guys seen Ponyville? It's a disaster! I'm staying here in Cloudsdale where everything's awesome.
20200d How in Equestria can she think that tiny patch of clouds is Cloudsdale?
202008 The same way he got you to think that cheap rock was a bona fide diamond.
20200d I thought we agreed never to speak of that again.
202003 Time for plan B.
20200c [snoring]
202003 [whispering] Okay, Fluttershy, you grab Rainbow Dash and hold her down. Applejack will lower me down from this rope so I can cast the memory spell on her.
20200e Got it!
20200c [snoring]
20200e Um...I'm just wondering if it's okay if I hold you down against your will for a little bit?
202003 Ugh...
20200c Nice try! Ponyville's your problem, not mine.
202003 Come on, Fluttershy, we've got to catch her. Hyah! Applejack!
20201e WHOA!
20200d PINKIE! You were supposed to secure the ROPE!
202007 Oops.
202008 Rarity, Pinkie, hold on! Y'all are slowing her down!
20200d Oh, Fluttershy, would you be a dear and FLY FASTER, please?
20200e [whimper] I can't!
202003 If you can't catch her, Discord wins!
20200e That big... dumb... MEANIE!
202003 Okay, Applejack, last rope! Make it count!
20200c Lemme go! I don't need you guys! Leave me alone! Wh-what happened? [gasp] How's Ponyville? Where are the Elements?! Did we stop Discord?
20204d [cheering]
202003 Maybe it's a little early for a group hug.
2020db [laughter] Chaos is a wonderful, wonderful thing.
202003 Not as wonderful as friendship.
2020db Oh, this again?
202000 [explosion]
202008 That's right. You couldn't break apart our friendship for long.
2020db Oh, Applejack. Don't lie to me. I'm the one who made you a liar. Will you ever learn?
202003 I'll tell you what we've learned, Discord - we've learned that friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt it's worth fighting for!
2020db Ugh, gag. Fine, go ahead. Try and use your little Elements. Friend me. Just make it quick. I'm missing some excellent chaos here.
202003 All right, ladies, let's show him what friendship can do!
202007 Wait-wait-wait! [slurp] [growl]
2020db Huh. What's this? No. Nooooo!
202000 [crash]
202000 [trumpet fanfare]
202019 We are gathered here today to once again honor the heroism of these six friends who stood up to the villain Discord and saved Equestria from eternal chaos.

203003 Quill.
203005 Check.
203003 Parchment.
203005 Check.
203003 Extra ink.
203005 Check.
203003 Extra extra ink.
203005 Check.
203003 Is that everything on the checklist?
203005 Yep.
203003 Great. Now that we've completed the checklist of things we need to create a checklist, we can make my checklist of the things I have to get done by the end of the day. Ready?
203005 Ready!
203003 Item one - create checklist of the things I have to accomplish by the end of the day.
203005 [sighs]
203000 [theme song]
203003 How are we doing, Spike?
203005 Let's see... We've already dropped off your cape at the cleaners, returned the blackboard you borrowed from Cheerilee, ordered new parchment and quills from the stationery shop...
203003 Hmm... Seems like we just placed an order for those a few days ago.
203005 Can't imagine why we go through so many of them.
203003 Sounds like we're ahead of schedule. What's next?
203005 Cupcakes!
203005 Whoa...
203003 Uh, I only ordered twelve.
20302a Oh, I know, dear, but I had an extra. So I thought I'd make it a baker's dozen.
203005 Uhhh-no!
203003 Oh, that was very thoughtful of you. It's just some of the icing from the extra cupcake is getting all over the one next to it. See?
20302a Ohh... sure...
203003 It's just that I'm planning on sharing these at a picnic later and I don't want anypony to feel like somepony else is getting more icing.
20302a Oh, no... of course not.
203003 Not to worry, I'll just move some of this one to... hmm... I think I may have scooped too much... oops! Now those two have more. Let's just try this again... Hmm, no, that won't do. Let me just... hmm... put some here, and... no, that's not right. A little more on this one, a little bit... and wait... I'll just... ooh, a little bit here, and here, and... perfect!
20302a Hmm, oh yes... much better...
203003 Okay, time to tackle the next item on our— oops! Looks like we're going to have to add 'give a baby dragon a bath' to our list.
203005 [slurp]
203003 Very efficient! And a little bit gross.
203005 Eh.
203005 Looks like that's everything!
203003 Almost everything.
203005 "Triple-check checklist to make sure we didn't miss anything when we double checked the checklist." Uh... check. Ugh... I've been holding that quill so long, I've got a claw cramp! Well, good thing we don't have anything to report to Princess Celestia this week... I don't think I could write another word!
203003 We haven't sent a letter to Princess Celestia this week?!
203005 Why? Is that bad?
203003 Bad? Bad?! Of course it's bad! I'm supposed to send Princess Celestia a letter every week telling her about a lesson I've learned about friendship! Not every other week. Not every ten days. Every. Single. Week!
203005 Huh?
203003 Ohh... Where's my calendar, where's my calendar?!
203005 Where it... always is?
203003 When did we send the last one?
203005 Last... Tuesday?
203003 And today is...
203005 Tuesday?
203003 Ah! Oh nononononononono! If I don't send her a letter by sundown, I'll be... tardy!
203005 What's that now?
203003 Tar-dy, Spike! Late, I'll be late! Oh, how could I let this happen? I'm usually so organized. I've never been late with an assignment.
203005 Oh, please! You're the most studious student ever! I'm sure the Princess will forgive you if you miss one little deadline.
203003 I'm afraid to take that chance, Spike. This is the ruler of all of Equestria we're talking about. The pony who holds my fate in her hooves! What if she doesn't forgive me?
203005 Yeah... I don't think she—
203003 What if instead she starts thinking I'm not taking my studies on friendship seriously?
203005 Why would she—
203003 What if she makes me come back to Canterlot and puts me back in school and makes me prove I've been taking them seriously by giving me a test?! [gasps] What if I don't pass?!
203005 Well, why wouldn't you pass—
203003 She's my teacher. Do you know what teachers do to students who don't pass? They send them back a grade! But she won't just send me back a grade. She'll send me back to... magic kindergarten.
2030ed [laughing]
203005 Twilight? Twilight!
203003 Huh?
203005 That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! You're not going to be sent back to magic kindergarten.
203003 You're right. I have no reason to worry. Because I'm going to solve a friend's problem and get that letter to Princess Celestia before sundown!
203005 [sighs]
203003 So... got any problems, troubles, conundrums, or any other sort of issues, major or minor, that I as a good friend could help you solve?
203005 Huh. Hmm. Huunh. Huh... I got nothin'.
203003 [sigh] Then it looks like I'm going to have to find somepony who does.
203005 [sigh] This won't end well.
203000 [clock ticking]
203003 You've got this, Twilight. You still have plenty of time to get that letter to Princess Celestia! Has to be somepony who needs the help of a good friend!
20300d [screaming]
203003 Rarity!
20300d [continued screaming]
203003 Don't worry, Rarity! I'm here!
20300d [sobbing] Why me-e-e-e-e-ee... [gasp] WHYYYY?! Why? Why-y?! And of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING!
203003 What's happened? Are you alright?
20300d [gasp] I've lost my diamond-encrusted purple ribbon! I have searched high, and I have searched low. Low and high! High and low! But I can't find it anywhere! Anywhe-e-e-e-ere! How can I possibly finish my latest creation if I can't find it?!
203003 Never fear, Rarity. As your friend I'll do my best to help you fi—
20300d Oh, there it is. Isn't it always just the last place you look?
203003 So... you just lost your ribbon?
20300d Mm-hm!
203003 But now you've found it?
20300d Yuh-huh.
203003 And nothing else is bothering you? Nothing that I, as a good friend, could help you with?
20300d Hmm... there is one thing.
203003 Yes?
20300d I think I left my measuring tape under the fabric over there. Could you get that for me?
203003 [sighs] Measuring tape? Sure.
20300d Twilight? Is there something bother— Twilight?
203000 [clock ticking]
203003 No need to panic. Rarity is just one pony. I'm sure one of my other friends will need me.
20300c [grunting and kiai noises]
203000 [crashing]
203003 What in the world...? Rainbow must be angry with Applejack! She must hate her guts! How wonderful! Rainbow Dash! Stop! Listen, Rainbow. I know you're upset with Applejack, but don't worry. Whatever it is that has come between you two, I'm sure that I, as a good friend, can help you resolve your problems.
20300c Uh, what are you talking about?
203003 Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to hide your feelings from me! I can tell you two must've had a terrible fight.
203003 Now, why don't you tell me all about your issues with Applejack.
20300c I don't have any issues with Applejack.
203003 You don't? Then why are you destroying her property?
20300c Because she asked me to. Right, Applejack?
203008 Yes, ma'am. I wanted to put up a new barn, but this one's gotta come down first. Hehe. Now get back to it, R.D.
20300c You got it, boss!
203008 I'd take cover if I were you.
203003 [yelps]
20300c [screams]
203000 [explosion]
203003 [sigh]
203000 [clock ticking]
203003 [sigh] I can't believe I wasted all that time. I should have just come here first. Fluttershy always has some fear she's trying to get over. As a good friend, I'll be able to help her.
2030ee [roars]
20300e [grunting]
203003 Fluttershy?
20300e [grunting, yelling]
203003 How can this be happening? Of all the days she had to stop being such a scaredy-pony, she had to pick today?! What am I going to do?!
20300e You really should have come to me sooner. You were carrying so much tension in that shoulder.
2030ee [growls]
203003 It's fine. It'll all be fine. The day isn't over yet. But it will be over soon!
203000 [clock ticking]
203003 [groans] It'll be all over! My time in Ponyville! My advanced studies! Nono. You're a good student. You can do this. Ooh! But what if I can't? You can! You just have to keep it together. Keep. It. Together!
203005 Are you talking to... yourself? Twilight?
2030ed [laughing]
203005 Snap out of it!
203003 Huh?
203005 Are you okay?
2030ed [laughing]
203005 Twilight, I'm really worried. I mean this letter thing is really getting to you. Here. You've been so anxious all day that you completely forgot about the picnic. Why don't you just relax and go hang out with—
203003 The picnic! I should go see my friends!
203005 I'm glad you've come to your senses.
20300d Please tell me I did not forget the plates. [gasp] I did. I totally forgot them. Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! [cries] Why, why, why... Uh... What? You didn't expect me to lay on the grass, did you?
203000 [bray]
203008 You alright, hun?
203003 No! I am not alright.
203053 [surprised muttering]
203003 It's just terrible.
203018 Yes?
203003 Simply awful.
203018 Yes?!
203003 It's the most horrific trouble I've ever been in and I really really really need your help!
203018 YES?!
203003 My letter to Princess Celestia is almost overdue, and I haven't learned anything about friendship!
203018 [sighs]
20300e Oh, thank goodness. I thought something really awful had happened.
203003 [strangled noises] Something awful has happened! If I don't turn in the letter on time, I'll be tardy! TARDY!
203018 [giggles]
203008 No offense, sugarcube, but it looks like somepony's gettin' themselves all worked up over nothin'.
203003 This is not nothing. This is everything. I need you guys to help me find somepony with a problem I can fix before sundown! My whole life depends on it!
203007 [giggles] Oh, Twilight, you're such a crack-up! [laughs]
203008 Come on now. Have a seat and stop sweatin' the small stuff.
203003 [groans]
20300e Wow. I've never seen Twilight so upset before.
20300d Oh, what a drama queen. Mm. Relatively speaking...
203000 [clock ticking]
203003 Clock is ticking, Twilight. Clock. Is. Ticking. Keep it together. If I can't find a friendship problem... I'll make a friendship problem!
203000 [bird chirping]
203003 [insane giggles]
2030ef [giggling]
203003 Hi, girls! [twitching]
20300a Oh, hi, Twilight. How's it go—
203003 Gr-eat. Just great. You three look like you're doing great too! Looks like three good friends who obviously don't need the help of another good friend. This is Smarty Pants. She was mine when I was your age, and now I want to give her to you!
203065 Uhh... she's... great.
20300a Yeah. Great.
203066 I really... like her... mane.
203003 She even comes with her own notebook and quill, for when you want to pretend she's doing her homework!
203065 That's... um... great.
20300a Yeah... great.
203066 I really like her... mane?
203003 I just hope the fact that there are three of you and only one of her doesn't become a problem! I'd hate to cause a rift between such good friends. So, who wants to play with her first?
20300a Uh... You should play with her first, Sweetie Belle. Y'know, 'cause you like her mane so much.
203066 Nonononononono. I think Scootaloo should get to play with her first.
203065 I'd love to, but, um, you take her, Apple Bloom.
20300a Applejack says it's important to share.
203003 [thinking] I gotta think of something! Thinkthinkthinkthinkthink Twilight, think! [gasp] That's it! [aloud] Ooh, you're going to like Smarty Pants. And you're going to like her more than anything.
203065 [gasp] I want it.
20300a I need it.
203066 I really like her mane!
2030ef [arguing]
203003 The 'want it, need it' spell. Works every time. Okay, okay, let's break it up. I think we can all see that there is an important lesson to be learned here about— ugh! C'mon, girls, we're all friends here, right? Don't you think you ought to share?
20300a No way!
203003 [groan] Big McIntosh! Thank goodness! You've gotta help me get that doll away from those girls!
203026 Eeyup.
2030ef [continue arguing]
203003 Oh, thank you so much. Now if you could just give her to me?
203026 Nnnope.
203003 Oh no!
20300a Give her back!
2030ef [Don't touch it! It's mine! I want it!]
203010 What's all the commotion about?
2030f0 They're fighting over that doll!
203027 That incredible, amazing doll!
20300f [arguing]
203003 Can't... get... a clear shot! [grunting]
203010 Gimme!
203026 Nope.
203003 Oh, what have I done?!
20300f [arguing]
203008 Y'all hear that? What in the name of all things oats 'n apples is goin' on here?!
203003 Don't look at it!
20300d Don't look at what?
203003 My Smarty Pants doll! I enchanted her and now everypony is fighting over her!
20300e Why would you enchant your doll?
203003 Oh, I had to do something! I had nothing to report to Princess Celestia! I thought if I couldn't find a problem, I'd make a problem! The day is almost over!
203008 Not almost!
203019 Twilight Sparkle!
203008 Whoa nelly.
203000 [Smarty Pants doll squeaks]
203026 [neighs and whinnies]
203019 Meet me in the library.
203003 Goodbye, girls. If you care to visit, I'll be in magic kindergarten, back in Canterlot.
20300e Magic kindergarten?
20300c Canterlot?
203007 We're never gonna see Twilight again!
203008 Uh, what are we gonna do, y'all?
20300d Of all the worst things that could happen, this is THE. WORST. POSSIBLE. THING! What? I really mean it this time!
203003 But, but... I'm supposed to send you a letter about friendship every week. I missed the deadline. I'm a bad student! I'm... tardy!
203019 You are a wonderful student, Twilight. I don't have to get a letter every week to know that.
203003 Really?
20300c Wait!
203007 You can't punish her!
203008 It wasn't her fault!
203019 I'm listening.
20300e Please, your Highness. We all saw that Twilight was upset.
20300c But we thought that the thing she was worrying about wasn't worth worrying about.
203008 So when she ran off all worked up, not a single one of us tried to stop her.
20300d As Twilight's good friends, we should have taken her feelings seriously and been there for her!
20300e Please don't take her away from us just because we were too insensitive to help her.
203019 Looks like you all learned a pretty valuable lesson today.
203018 Mm-hmm.
203019 Very well. I'll forget Twilight's "punishment" on one condition.
203018 [All right, etc.]
203019 From this day forth, I would like you all to report to me your findings on the magic of friendship when, and only when, you happen to discover them.
203018 [cheering]
203003 Princess Celestia, wait! How did you know I was in trouble?
203019 Your friend Spike made me aware that you were letting your fears get the best of you. I commend him for taking your feelings seriously. Now, if you will all excuse me, I must return to Canterlot. I'm expecting some mail.
203008 Y'all heard the Princess. Spike, take a letter.
203008 [clears throat] Dear Princess Celestia,
203008 We're writin' to you because today we all learned a little somethin' about friendship.
20300e We learned that you should take your friends' worries seriously.
20300c Even if you don't think that she has anything to worry about.
20300d And that you shouldn't let your worries turn a small problem...
203007 ...into an enormously huge entire-town-in-total-chaos Princess-has-to-come-and-save-the-day problem.
203008 Signed, your loyal subjects.
203005 P.S. Obviously, Spike did not have to learn a lesson, because he is the best, most awesome friend a pony could ask for. Unlike everypony else, he took things seriously, and- Eheh... uh... yeah... I'll just, um...
203012 [laughs]
203005 [snorts]

203000 [credits]
204005 Ugh, come on, Twilight. We're gonna be late for the Nightmare Night festival. Huh? Are you that one kooky grandpa from Ponyville Retirement Village?
204003 I'm Star Swirl the Bearded! Father of the amniomorphic spell? Did you even read that book I gave you about obscure unicorn history?
204005 Uh...
204000 [knocking]
204005 That sounds important. [yelp]
2040ed Nightmare Night! What a fright! Give us something sweet to bite!
204003 Hi, everypony. Great costumes. Happy Nightmare Night, Granny Smith.
204009 I should have been asleep five hours ago.
2040f2 Pipsqueak the pirate, at your service. It's my very first Nightmare Night.
204003 Since you moved here from Trottingham?
2040f2 No, my very first Nightmare Night ever!
204007 [chicken squawk] Enough chitchat! Time is candy!
204003 Pinkie Pie, aren't you a little old for this?
204007 Too old for free candy? [chicken squawk] Never.
204003 Do you like it?
204007 Yeah, great costume, Twilight. You make a fantastic weirdo clown.
204003 A clown?! Look at the borders on these robes. These are hoof-stitched!
204005 It's a great costume... huh, grandpa.
204003 [growls]
204000 [theme song]
204003 Star Swirl the Bearded is only the most important conjurer of the pre-classical era.
20400f [cheering]
204003 He created more than two hundred spells! He even has a shelf in the Canterlot library of magic named after him. Maybe I should start up a pony group to teach ponies about history. I bet everypony would love it! Don't you, Spike?
204005 Mm-hmm! [chewing] I love it!
204003 Hey look, we're here already! Should we get something to eat?
204005 [burp]
204007 Twilight, Twilight! Look at our haul! Ah! Can you believe it? And then, we went to Cheerilee's house, and got a bunch more goodies. Didn't we, Pip?
2040f2 Sure did!
204007 And then, we had to stop and wait for Granny Smith, and—
204000 [lightning zap]
204007 [chicken squawk]
2040f3 [screaming]
20400c [laughing]
204003 Rainbow Dash, that wasn't very nice.
20400c Lighten up, old-timer. This is the best night of the year for pranks!
204003 Look what you did to Spike!
204005 [choking]
20400c It's all in good fun. Oh! Oh! There's another group over there!
204000 [lightning zap]
2040f4 [screaming]
20400c [laughing]
204003 Happy Nightmare Night, Applejack!
204008 Howdy, Spike! Hey, Twilight! Nice costume.
204005 Thanks! I'm a dragon.
204003 She means me, Spike.
204008 With that beard, I reckon you're some sorta country music singer.
204003 [grunt]
204005 [laughing]
204008 While y'all are here, ya' feel like bobbin' for an apple?
204000 [cheering and applauding]
204010 Thank you, everypony, and welcome to the Nightmare Night festival!
204000 [cheering and applauding]
204010 Now, all the little ponies who have been out collecting sweets should follow our friend Zecora to hear the legend of... Nightmare Moon! [laughter]
204005 Spooky voice might work better if she wasn't dressed like that.
204003 [giggling]
204047 Follow me, and very soon, you'll hear the tale of Nightmare Moon.
204047 Listen close, my little dears, I'll tell you where you got your fears of Nightmare Night, so dark and scary. [blows] Of Nightmare Moon, who makes you wary.
20404d [gasps]
204047 Every year, we put on a disguise, to save ourselves from her searching eyes.
2040f3 [screaming]
204047 But Nightmare Moon wants just one thing - to gobble up ponies in one quick swing!
2040f5 [scream]
204047 Hungrily, she soars the sky. If she sees nopony, she passes by. So if she comes and all is clear, Equestria is safe another year!
2040f2 Uh, Miss Zecora, if we wear costumes to hide from Nightmare Moon, so she won't gobble us up, how come we still need to give her some of our candy?
204047 A perfect question, my little friend. For Nightmare Moon you must not offend. [blows] Fill up her belly with a treat or two, so she won't return to come eat you!
204007 [screaming] Everypony! Just dump some candy and get out of here!
204000 [thunder]
204000 [wind whistling]
20404d [screaming]
204007 [gasp] It's Nightmare Moon! Run!
20404d [screaming]
204000 [thunder]
20404d [screaming, squawking]
204000 [thunder, lightning, screaming]
204003 Princess Luna!
2040f6 [whimpers]
20401a [booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! We have graced your tiny village with our presence, so that you might behold the real Princess of the Night! A creature of nightmares no longer, but instead a pony who desires your love and admiration! Together we shall change this dreadful celebration into a bright and glorious feast!
204000 [lightning, thunder]
204007 Did you hear that, everypony? Nightmare Moon says she's gonna feast on us all!
20404d [screaming]
20401a [normal voice] What? No, children, no! You no longer have reason to fear us! Screams of delight is what your princess desires, not screams of terror! [stomps hoof] Madame Mayor, thy Princess of the Night hath arrived.
204010 [gasp]
2040f7 [gasp]
20401a What is the matter with you? Very well, then. Be that way. We won't even bother with the traditional royal farewell.
204003 I'm gonna go talk to her.
204005 You can't talk to her! She's Nightmare Moon!
204003 No, she's not. I saw the Elements of Harmony change her back to good. But it seems like she's having some trouble adjusting after being gone for a thousand years.
204003 Princess Luna? Hi, my name is—
20401a Star Swirl the Bearded. Commendable costume! Thou even got the bells right.
204003 Thank you! Finally! Somepony who gets my costume! Uh, I just came to welcome you to our celebration! My actual name is—
20401a Twilight Sparkle. [booming voice] It was thou who unleashed the powers of harmony upon us and took away our dark powers!
204003 And that was a good thing, right?
20401a [normal voice] But of course. We could not be happier. Is that not clear?
204003 Well, you kinda sound like you're yelling at me.
20401a But this is the traditional royal Canterlot voice! It is tradition to speak using the royal "we", and to use [booming voice] this much volume when addressing our subjects!
204003 You know, that might explain why your appearance was met with... mixed results. I think if you just changed your approach a bit, you might be met with a warmer reception.
20401a [booming voice] Change our approach?
204003 Lower the volume?
20401a [normal voice] Ohhh. We have been locked away for a thousand years. We are... not sure we can.
204003 Don't worry, Princess. Fluttershy can give you some great pointers. She's delicate and demure with the sweetest little voice. [knocks]
20400e Go away! No candy here! Visitors not welcome on Nightmare Night!
204003 [nervous laughing] Fluttershy, it's me, Twilight!
20400e It is you. Ah, and Nightmare Moon. [gasp] Nightmare Moon? [yelps]
204000 [door slams]
204003 [nervous laughter] Wait right here.
204000 [various noises]
204003 Fluttershy... you remember Princess Luna?
20401a [booming voice] Charmed.
20400e Likewise.
20401a [booming voice] Twilight Sparkle hath spoken of the sweetness of thy voice. We ask thou teachest to us to speak as thou speakest.
20400e [quiet] Okay.
20401a [booming voice] Shall our lessons begin?
20400e [whisper] Okay.
20401a [booming voice] Shall we mimic thy voice?
20400e [quiet] Okay.
20401a [booming voice] How is this?
20400e Perfect. Lesson over.
204000 [door thuds shut]
204003 A little quieter, princess.
20401a [booming voice] How is... [loud voice] this?
204003 Better. Right, Fluttershy?
20400e [dazed laughter] Yes.
20401a [loud voice] How... about... now?
204003 Now you're getting it.
20401a [normal voice] And... how about now?
204003 Yes! Well done.
20401a [booming voice] I thank thee, dear Fluttershy! Our normal speaking voice shall surely win us the hearts of thy fellow villagers.
204007 Fluttershy! You've gotta hide us! Nightmare Moon is here and... [chicken squawk] Ah! She stole Fluttershy's voice so she can't scream when she gobbles her up!
2040f3 [screaming]
20401a [booming voice] Nay, children, wait! [normal voice] I mean... nay, children, no, wait.
204003 Come on, princess. Time for plan B.
20404d Hurray!
2040f8 [whimper]
2040f9 Aah!
20401a It is of no use, Twilight Sparkle. They have never liked us and they never shall.
204003 My friend Applejack is one of the most likable ponies around. I'm sure she'll have some ideas.
2040f2 Heee...!
204008 Whoop. Careful there, partner. [whimper]
204003 Uh... Applejack, the princess is looking for a little advice on how to fit in around here.
204008 "Fit in"? Really?
204003 [grunt]
204008 I mean... that's easy! All you gotta do is have the right attitude. Loosen up a bit, be positive, play a few games, have some fun.
20401a Fun? What is this "fun" thou speakest of? Pray tell, what purpose do these serve?
2040a7 Try to land the sp-sp-spiders on the web.
204008 You can do it, princess!
20401a Ha! Your princess enjoys this "fun"! In what other ways may we experience it?
204003 Fire away, princess!
20401a Ha ha! The fun has been doubled!
20404d Hurray! [cheering]
204008 Why don't you try bobbin' for apples? We got the best apples in Equestria here, princess.
20401a I ask that thou call us... me... Luna, fair Applejack. Hear me, villagers! All of you! Call me Luna!
20404d Luna... [approving chatter]
20401a Show me to these bobbing apples.
2040f2 Whoa! [splash]
204007 Hey, gals. Anypony seen Pip? We lost him the last time we had to run– [chicken squawk] Aaah! Nightmare Moon is gobbling Pipsqueak! Everypony run!
2040ed [scream]
2040f2 Help! My backside has been gobbled!
20401a 'Tis a lie! Thy backside is whole and ungobbled, thou ungrateful whelp!
204000 [thunder]
20401a Fair villagers, please do not back away. Let us join together in... fun!
204000 [toy spider squeaks]
20401a Not enough fun for you? What say you to this?!
2040fa [screaming]
20401a Huzzah! How many points do I receive?
20403a [scream]
2040fa [screaming]
20401a Do not run away!
204022 [scream]
20401a As your princess, we command you!
2040fa [screaming]
20401a [booming voice] Be still!
204003 Princess, remember! Watch the screaming!
20401a [booming voice] No, Twilight Sparkle! We must use the traditional royal Canterlot voice for what we are about to say. Since you choose to fear your princess rather than love her, and dishonor her with this insulting celebration, we decree that Nightmare Night shall be canceled... forever!
204000 [thunder]
204008 [sigh] Shoot. We had everything goin' our way. Luna was happy, everypony in town was happy, now look at 'em.
2040fb [crying] But I wanted to be a zombie next year.
204003 It's not over yet.
204008 What are you gonna do?
204003 I'm going to do what I do best. Lecture her!
204003 Princess?
20401a Leave me be, Twilight Sparkle.
204003 Princess, I'm sorry it hasn't worked out how we wanted. But you have to believe me when I tell you that Nightmare Night is one of the most popular celebrations we have.
20401a Yes. I can tell. By all the adoring shrieks of the children as they run away.
204003 Princess...
20400f [whimpering and crying]
204007 [chicken squawking] [shriek]
204003 No! No shrieking. No squealing or screaming either. Okay?
204007 [muffled] Okay.
204003 There's something I want you to see. And I promise that it's safe, but you really, really, really can't shriek. Do you promise not to shriek?
204007 Mm-hmm. [chicken squawk]
204003 Pinkie Pie, you remember Princess Luna, right?
20401a Ah. The ringleader of the frightened children. Hast thou come to make peace?
204000 [thunder]
204007 Nightmare Moon! [chicken squawk]
204003 Rainbow!
20400c [laughter]
204003 She's changed, Pinkie! She's not evil or scary anymore! And she definitely doesn't want to gobble you up!
204007 Well, duh.
204003 Huh?
204007 I know that. Sheesh, Twilight. I'm almost as big as her; how's she gonna gobble me up?
204003 So why do you keep running away and screaming?
204007 Sometimes, it's just really fun to be scared!
204003 Fun? Pinkie Pie, you're a genius!
204007 No, I'm not. I'm a chicken. [chicken squawk]
204003 Princess Luna! I've finally figured out why you're having so much trouble being liked!
20401a Forgive me if I withhold my enthusiasm.
204003 Come with me. I'll explain everything on the way.
2040f2 Gosh. I never thought my very first Nightmare Night would be my very last.
204047 Come, little Pip. Now don't you fret. Nightmare Night's not over yet. We still have candy left to give, so Nightmare Moon might let us live.
204010 Yes. Come on, little ponies. What's Nightmare Night without the annual candy offering? You don't want Nightmare Moon to gobble you up, do you?
204005 Aw, the rainbow wig just kills it for me.
204008 Come on, kids! Doesn't that sound like fun?
2040f2 Goodbye, Nightmare Night. Forever.
204000 [wind whistling]
2040fc [booming voice] Citizens of Ponyville! You were wise to bring this candy to me. I am pleased with your offering. So pleased that I may just eat it... instead of eating you!
20400f [scream]
20401a [spit] I am not certain that did what you meant for it to do, Twilight Sparkle.
204003 Just wait.
20401a For what? For... for them to scream some more?
2040f2 Um... Princess Luna. I know there's not gonna be any more Nightmare Night, but do you suppose maybe you could come back next year and scare us again anyway?
20401a Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you?
2040f2 It's really fun! Scary, but fun!
20401a It... is?
2040f2 Yeah! Nightmare Night is my favorite night of the year.
20401a Well then. We shall have to bring [booming voice] Nightmare Night back!
2040f2 Whoa! You're my favorite princess ever! [to foals] She said yes, guys!
2040f3 YAY!
204003 See? They really do like you, princess.
20401a Can it be true? [thunder, booming voice] Oh, most wonderful of— [normal voice] I mean... Oh, most wonderful of nights.
204003 Dear Princess Celestia,
204003 When you first sent me to Ponyville, I didn't know anything about friendship. I met somepony tonight who was having the same problem—your sister, Princess Luna! She taught me that one of the best things you can do with friendship is to give it to others, and help them find it themselves! And I'm happy to report that all of Ponyville has learned that even if somepony seems a little intimidating, even scary, when you offer them your friendship, you'll discover a whole new pony underneath. And even if my Star Swirl the Bearded costume didn't go over, this still turned out to be the best Nightmare Night ever!
204000 [lightning zap]
20400c [scream]
20401a [laughter]
204049 [laughter]
204000 [music]
204000 [credits]
205000 [birds chirping]
20500d [mumbling in sleep] Oh... Are those sweet... carrot... pancakes I smell? [gasp] Mmm, how divine, num num num num. The aroma... spiced warm apple cider. [sniff] Ahh, and, the smell of... smoke... smoke? Smoke?! SMOO— AAH!
205000 [fire siren, crashing, yelps]
205066 Rarity! Rrgh, you ruined the surprise! I was gonna serve you breakfast in bed!
20500d [sigh]
205000 [theme song]
20500d [inhales]
2050fd Well! G'mornin', Rarity!
20500d Father! Mother!
2050fd I'll have you know that Sweetie Belle here cooked this yummy lookin' breakfast all on her own.
20500d I... figured. [sniffs] I didn't know you could burn juice.
2050fe I've been giving her lessons. I wouldn't be surprised if she's got a cutie mark in fancy cooking by the time we get back from our vacation.
20500d Vacation? Is that this week? As in 'starting this very instant' this week?! Uurh. Let me guess - apple sauce?
205066 Nope. Toast! We're gonna have the bestest time two sisters could ever have! I'm gonna go grab my stuff from Dad's wagon.
20500d So, now, when you say 'a week'... is that, um, seven whole days?
2050fe And six nights, I know! Such a short time to spend with your little sis.
2050fd You gonna eat that?
20500d But I've got such a long to-do list. Oh well, I suppose 'spend time with your sister' will just have to be added to the list.
205000 [crash]
205066 Just a few necessities.
205000 [horn honks]
20500d Now, let's get that kitchen all cleaned up.
205066 Cleaned up? But we haven't even eaten yet.
20500d Well now, Sweetie Belle, I appreciate the gesture, but we simply can't eat this breakfast; it's burnt.
205066 It's not that burnt.
20500d Never fear, my dear, I'll get a proper breakfast going. [hums]
205066 Can I help?
20500d Oh, er, of course, er, in one moment, Sweetie Belle. Let me just get things started.
205066 Rarity! I thought you said I was gonna help!
20500d You are! You... can... put the garnish on the plates.
205066 You mean this parsley?
20500d Okay, now, easy! It has to be just right! No need to rush. No! That's too slow. Careful! Back up! Looking for perfection here...
205066 Whoa, whoa!
205000 [crash]
20500d Not... bad.
20500d [gasp] There are some things I must attend to. Can you take the dirty towels to the laundry room?
205066 No problem, I'll make myself useful!
20500d Sweetie Belle!
205066 I told you I'd make myself useful. Surprised?
20500d Am I? You washed my incredibly expensive one-of-a-kind designer crocheted wool sweater! Do you know how hard these things are to come by?
205066 What's the big deal?
20500d The big deal is that in the heat of the sun, wool... shrinks.
205066 Oh. Sorry.
20500d Nng... Well. Back to work. I must create!
205000 [splash]
205066 Sorry?
20500d Huh. Stay out of trouble, okay? Please?
205066 I just wanted to do something nice for my sister.
205066 Raargh, I'm so bored! When is Rarity gonna finish her work?
20500d [in Sweetie Belle's mind] Stay out of trouble, okay?
205066 I never got in trouble for drawing. Hmm. This needs something...
205066 Hi, Rarity! I made a special drawing for y—
20500d [screams] Oh no! Did you use these gems?!
205066 Well, yes, but I know you have more in your work room—
20500d But, but these are extremely rare baby blue sapphires! I need them for an outfit for an extremely important client!
205066 Oh. Sorry.
20500d [sigh] Sweetie Belle, what am I going to do with you?
205066 Oh! We could paint together, we could ride bikes, play chess, sing a song, catch frogs, pillow fight—
20500d That's not what I meant!
205066 Oh.
20500d Now I have to go and find some more of these gems!
205066 I'll go with you and help!
20500d No! No thank you. You can help by picking up these papers and stacking them, neatly. Put the pens and pencils back exactly where you found them, and please find something to do that doesn't create a large mess for me to clean up!
205066 Geez Louise, can't I do anything right?
20500d Sweetie Belle! I'm back! Sweetie Belle? [gasps in shock]
205066 Surprise!
20500d My— ee— bleh— My inspiration room! What did you do? What did you do?!
205066 When I saw the big mess in your room, I thought I'd clean it up for you.
20500d This wasn't a mess! It was organized chaos! I was just about finished planning my new fashion line, and, and you, you, you went and, and you— and you put everything away!
205066 But every time I make a mess, you get upset!
20500d But this was my mess in my house! And now I have to start from scratch!
205066 But... I-I thought it would make you happy!
20500d Happy?! Happy?! I— [grinds teeth] I just need some time alone. Hm!
20500a How's the sleepover at Rarity's goin'?
205066 [mimicking Rarity] Why, it's smashing!
20500a Huh?
205066 I just wish we could do something special together that didn't include me goofing anything up.
20500a The Sisterhooves Social! Applejack an' I do it every year! You an' Rarity can compete against other sister teams in all these neat events!
205066 That sounds like the perfect way for us to hang out! Rarity will think it's an excellent idea.
20500d What a ridiculous idea. A contest at Sweet Apple Acres? It doesn't sound... very clean.
205066 So, what, now you're back to hating messes?
20500d Sweetie Belle, watch your tone! I am still your big sister.
205066 Right! And any sister who cares about her sister goes!
20500d Sweetie Belle...! Honestly! Playing silly little games in the dirt is just... uncouth! With or without a sister.
205066 Well then! Maybe, maybe I'll try the Sisterhooves Social without a sister! In fact, I think I'll try the rest of my life without a sister!
20500d [gasp] Oh, I'm the one who's ruining your life?! Really?! Have you looked around this place? I'm the one who'd be better off with no sister!
205066 Well it looks like we finally agree on something! Neither of us needs a sister!
20500d Deal!
205066 Deal! Goodbye, un-sister!
20500d Hmph!
205008 'Uncouth'? She said the Sisterhooves Social was 'uncouth'?
20500a Yeah! Uncouth? [belch] Wait. What's uncouth?
205066 It's not just the Social. She thinks I'm uncouth.
205008 Honey, Rarity thinks everything's uncouth.
20500a [with mouth full] What's uncouth?
205008 It means uncivil. Y'know, bad mannered?
20500a [belch]
205008 Exactly. Sweetie Belle, just give Rarity some time. She'll come around. Sisters always do.
205066 Not sisters like Rarity.
205008 Come on, now. Apple Bloom and I got some chores to finish up on. Maybe you can help!
205066 You sure you want me to help? I just mess everything up!
205008 Oh, come on, that's just stinkin' thinkin'. Watch!
2050ff [laughing]
205008 Good catch there, Apple Bloom! Whoo!
2050ff [more laughing]
205066 This is a chore?
205008 Since we can't sell the bruised apples, we gotta collect them all for the pigs to eat.
20500a It's a lot of work, so we make a game of it. Wanna try?
205066 Um, okay. Ow! You're right, it is hard work.
20500a That's why we do it...
2050ff Together!
205066 Huh, Rarity never wants to do chores together.
20500d Ugh, all that work ruined, thanks to Sweetie Belle. Oh my. It's usually a big mess in here. [gasp] Id-ee-a! This is genius! I shall call it 'full spectrum fashions'! If Sweetie Belle hadn't— [clears throat] Well, no matter. She still shouldn't have touched my things without permission. Hm!
205008 Apple Bloom! You're up!
205066 You're... making... grape juice? Rarity would call the fashion police on me if I got grape juice anywhere near her precious outfits.
20500a Well, that's silly!
205008 Apple Bloom...
205066 Please, Applejack, she didn't mean—
20500a Whoa! [laughing]
205008 How d'you like them grapes, y'little whippersnapper!
20500a That tickles! [laughing]
20500d Now to get these fabrics washed for my fabulous new line. Ooh, my favorite sweater... I just can't believe that Sweetie Belle.
20506a [yowls]
20500d Oh, Opal-wopal! It's as if Sweetie Belle knew the sweater was perfect for you. And Sweetie Belle should consider herself perfectly lucky that this thoughtless mishap turned out all right. Hm.
205000 [sheep baaing]
205008 Apple Bloom!
20500a Got it, sis!
205066 Wow. It's as if they were just one pony.
2050ff Yee-haw!
205008 Way to corral some critters, sis!
205100 You coulda just a-a-a-asked.
205066 Rarity never high-hoofs me.
20500d Perfect! Just one more, and this ensemble is fini. Rrgh, Sweetie Belle! Where's her silly little arts and crafts project? Oh, Sweetie Belle, my one and only sister! What have I done? All the time I could have spent with you was wasted complaining and wishing you were gone! [crying] Woe is me! No! I must get her back, I must! As Celestia is my witness, I shall never be sisterless again!
20500d [gasp] Sweetie Belle! Oh, I have been galloping all over looking for you. I—
205066 Oh hello, un-sister. What are you doing here? Better be careful, you might get some dust on you.
20500d Oh, Sweetie Belle, I want to apologize. I am not better off without a sister.
205066 I'm not better off without a sister either. Spending the day with Applejack and Apple Bloom made me realize that.
20500d Oh, Sweetie, you don't know how happy I am to hear—
205066 And that's why I'm adopting Applejack as my big sister!
20500d What?!
205008 What?!
20500a What?!
205066 A sister is someone who loves and takes care of another sister. Applejack's a real sister.
205008 H-Hold on, Sweetie Belle. Don't get ahead of yourself here.
20500a Besides, she's my big sister!
205008 Yeah, um—
205066 [to Rarity] Or maybe she should be your sister, so she could teach you what a good sister is supposed to be!
205008 Heh, um, actually, I—
20500d But I don't need lessons on being a good sister, I-I promise! Listen! I'll show you how to cook my favorite quiche! Or, or, I'll show you the proper way to beautify your mane. Won't that be fun? Hm?
205066 Hm! You want me to go home with you, so we can do what you wanna do?
20500d Uh... yes?
205066 Just forget it!
20500a We're still sisters, right?
20500d Well, that apology went swimmingly. Applejack, why do you have to be so good and make me look so bad?
205008 [chuckles] Oh Rarity, once again you're thinkin' about yourself. Bein' sisters is a give and take. You've been doin' a whole lotta takin', but you haven't been doin' a whole lotta givin'.
20500d But of course I give. I give lessons. Reasonable demands.
205008 But ya never give in. Bein' sisters is like... apple pie. You can have amazin' apples, and you can have a wonderfully crispy crust, but only together you can have a perfect apple pie.
20500d But apart, all we are is just a pile of mush and some crumbly dry mess... [gasp] I know what I need to do! I just hope it isn't too late!
205066 Well, I guess it's a good thing Rarity isn't here. Do I see 'uncouth' written all over this contest?
20500a Look at the size of that pig!
205008 He sure is a cutie.
205066 That's the last word Rarity would use. [mimicking Rarity] Oh my, what a repulsive monstrosity! This thing needs a head to toe makeover!
205000 [trumpet call]
205008 It's almost time!
205066 Well, you two have fun. Sure wish I had a sister to run the race with. Huh?
20500a You do now!
205008 AB and I figured since we do this every year...
20500a I'd let you borrow my sis so you can give it a try!
205008 Sister for a day.
205066 No way!
20500a One. Day. One. Day.
205009 Is this thing on? [to Big McIntosh] I don't think this thing is on. [to the megaphone] Hello! [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] What is the— e— oh. You have to say so. Confangled modern doohickeys. Now, the event you've all been waiting fer! The Sister Soci— The Socialhooves— Oh, dabnabbit, you know, the big race! We have five teams this year fer the event! So y'all head on up to the finish line, y'hear? [Big McIntosh whispers into her ear] [to Big McIntosh] Eh? [to the megaphone] The start line! [to Big McIntosh] That's what I said.
205066 That's us.
20500a One. Day. Good luck!
205009 And may the best sisters win! On your marks... get set... Gooooo!
205008 [yelps]
205066 You okay, Applejack?
205066 Applejack, help!
205066 You can do it, sister!
205000 [ponies cheering]
20500a Ooh, so close! You almost won!
205066 Thank you, Applejack! You were amazing! I don't even care that we didn't win. This was so much fun! Huh? Rarity?! Wait, where's Applejack?
205008 [deep breath]
205066 I don't get it.
205008 [chuckles] We switched places over at the very first mudhole.
205066 So, we did the whole competition... together?
20500d That we did, little sister. Well, except for the start line.
20500a But you finished together!
205066 You mean... you were all in on it?
205101 Mm-hmm.
205066 You did this for me?
20500d Us. I did it for us. You see? We are apple pie!
205066 Huh?
20500d Uh, I'll explain later. For now, I think we deserve a celebration!
205102 Yeah!
205066 Where?
20500d The spa, of course.
205102 [laughing]
205066 Oh, Rarity.
20500d No, I-I-I'm serious.
20500d Very well then, what should we write to the Princess?
205066 I'll start. Having a sister is just about the bestest thing in the world. But it sure isn't the easiest.
20500d I agree that being sisters is a wonderful thing, but it takes teamwork. Sometimes it's about compromising. Sometimes it's about accepting each others' differences. But mostly, it's about having fun together, even if it means getting your hooves a little bit dirty.
205066 A lot dirty.
20500d A little bit dirty.
205066 A lot dirty.
20500d A little bit dirty!
205066 A lo—
205005 Hold it, hold it! How about "a medium amount of dirty, not too little, not too much, just right"?
205103 Deal!
205000 [birds chirping]
205000 [music]
205000 [credits]
20600a Today's the day, Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can just feel it! Today's the day we are all gonna get our cutie marks in... bowlin'!
206065 Whoo-hoo!
206066 [muffled] Whooo! [spits out bag] I mean, yaay!
20600a Why, after today, we won't even be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! We'll be the... the Three Strikes!
206065 That makes us sound like we've struck out.
20600a Mmm. How 'bout the Pin Twins?
206066 But there are three of us.
20600a Okay then... Um... the Bowlin' Dolls!
206066 The Bowling Dolls! That's it!
206065 Perfect!
20600a All righty then! Let's bowl 'em over!
206065 [laughs nervously]
20600a Phpoo!
206000 [ponies cheering]
206104 Cool! A bowling cutie mark!
20600a I did it! I did it! Blank?
206000 [more cheering]
20600a But... but... what about my ball?
206000 [theme song]
206066 That bowling sure was fun, even if all I got was gutter balls.
206065 Yeah, at least you were able to keep your ball in your lane. I don't think Mr Kingpin is ever gonna let me play again! Hey, maybe I could get my cutie mark in demolition!
206105 [laughs]
206065 Aw, come on, Apple Bloom.
206066 I know just what you need to put the bloom back on your apple.
206066 A treat from Sugarcube Corner will cheer you up.
20600a No, it won't.
206000 [kazoos blow]
206007 A party will cheer you up!
206105 [blow party whistles]
206000 [kazoos blow]
20600a No, it won't.
206000 [honk]
206000 [crash]
20600d A lovely new chapeau will cheer you up.
20600a No, it won't.
206065 Come on, Apple Bloom, it's just a cutie mark!
206066 Or lack of a cutie mark!
206065 Shh! That's not helping! Apple Bloom! Where are you going?! Apple Bloom, come back!
20600a Whoa! Ah! Ooh! Ow! Nnnn...
206047 Well, who is it that we have here? Why, it's Apple Bloom, my dear!
20600a Ow...
206047 What has happened to you, youth? Ah, you've gone and chipped your tooth. Come with me, I have just the trick that will fix you up quite quick.
20600a [with a lisp] I've tried everything, Zecora, and still no cutie mark! Well, I'm gonna be as old as Granny Smith and still have a blank flank!
206047 Your frustration is well understood, but one must be patient for all things good.
20600a [with a lisp] Ugh, I've heard that from every pony I know! And now from every zebra I know! I'm just too impatient to be patient. I just want my cutie mark and I want it now!
206000 [poof!]
206047 For your cutie mark, you will have to wait. We must fix that tooth before it's too late. Now drink down every little drop, and this mixture will mend that chip on top!
20600a [glug, glug] Oh my star apples, you did it, Zecora! Golly, you have tonics that heal all sorts of ailments. Bad bones, bad back, bad breath...
206047 Yes little one, it is true, I have many a healing brew.
20600a And not only stuff that fixes the bad, but stuff that brings the good! Good health, good hair... good heavens! Hmm... I bet you can mix up a brew to fix... anything.
206047 There are many mixtures in this room, but none for what you want, dear Apple Bloom. A magic potion does not hold the key. For a cutie mark, time is the only remedy.
20600a Fine. Whatcha got goin' on there?
206047 I am brewing up another mix for a rooster and his chicks. [muffled] It seems the rooster has lost his crow, [normal] making mornings very slow.
20600a Hey, I've seen that flower bloomin' in Ponyville! What is it?
206047 It is one we call 'Heart's Desire'. A dash will ignite the rooster's fire. With Heart's Desire, his talent comes into view, and he'll give a mighty cock-a-doodle-doo!
20600a Zowie! Heart's Desire, huh?
206047 Ay me, but what is this? I have run out of amethyst. I must go get this purple flower for my brew to have full power!
20600a Yeah, you go, you go.
206000 [foals chattering]
206066 I'm so hungry.
206065 Yeah, I can't wai—
206105 Aah! Apple Bloom! You got your cutie mark!
206066 Um, Apple Bloom... what is it?
206065 Yeah! Is it an 'o'? Is your talent spelling?
206066 Or is it a ring? Are you a jewelry maker?
20605d Or is it a powdered donut? 'Cause that sounds delicious.
20600a No, it's a loop-de-hoop!
206065 [gasp] A what now?
20600a A loop-de-hoop! 'Least, that's what I always called it. Applejack made it for me from an old rain barrel when I was littler! Who woulda thought that loop-de-hoop would end up bein' my special talent?
206066 Wow, Apple Bloom, that's amazing!
20605c That's it? That's your talent?
20605f Spinning a hoop around your waist? Puh-lease.
20600a Oh, you ain't seen nothin' yet.
206000 [foals cheering]
206065 Apple Bloom, you're super-duper-loop-de-hooper!
20600a Thanks, everypony!
206000 [bell rings]
20605b All right, my little ponies, time for class!
206000 [foals in awe of Apple Bloom]
20605b Apple Bloom?
20600a Yes, Miss Cheerilee?
20605b I want you to take your loop-de-hoop into the yard... and give us all a lesson in your amazing loop-de-hooping!
206000 [foals cheering]
206060 [grunting]
20600a Don't worry, gals. Keep at it and you might get to be half as good as me!
206060 Grr...
20600a Great job, girls!
206066 You're too kind, Apple Bloom.
206065 Yeah, we stink.
20600a Nah, you just need a little practice. Soon you'll be able to... hoop and bop! Hoop and hop! [muffled] Hoop and skip! [normal] And hoop and flip!
206000 [foals cheering]
20605b [laughs] Show us some more, Apple Bloom.
20600a Well, all right, just a few more tricks. But be warned! These are advanced moves, not for beginners. Got that, Diamond Tiara?
20605c [growls]
20600a I call this one the hoop-la!
206000 [helicopter rotor noise]
20600a Huh? Oof!
20605c Another cutie mark? Hah! I guess that last trick was a lot of hoopla. Those cutie marks are fake!
206106 [gasp]
20600a What? No they're not!
20605c Miss Cheerilee, have you ever heard of a pony with two cutie marks?
20605b I must say that I never have, but maybe Apple Bloom has two special talents!
20605f Oh yeah? Then let's see you do that!
206036 Spin plates!
206035 Yeah!
206000 [foals gasping]
206066 Two cutie marks?
206065 Two talents?
20600a Aw yeah!
206066 Our friend is the most...
206105 ...special pony ever!
20600a Alright, everypony, You ready for a real show?
206000 [ponies cheering]
20600c [snoring]
206008 [whistles]
206000 [more cheering]
206008 Yee-haw, little sis! Congratulations on gettin' not just one, but two cutie marks! We're mighty proud of you, right, Big McIntosh?
206026 Eeyup.
206008 I've never seen anythin' like it. Have you, Big Mac?
206026 Nnnope.
206009 Why, the way you were a-hoopin' and a-hoppin' and kickin' and spinnin' reminded me of when I was a spry young filly. Guh, charley horse, charley horse! Ooh, that's better.
206008 Why, Apple Bloom, I think you're ready to hit the rodeo circuit right now!
20600a Actually, I'm ready to hit the hay right now. I'm plum tuckered. I'll see y'all in the mornin'. Night!
206008 Night! Oh my, little Apple Bloom has finally blossomed, hasn't she, Big Mac?
206026 Eeyup!
206000 [tapping]
206008 [grunting] What in tarnation is that? Apple Bloom, what is all that awful... tapping? [gasp] Three cutie marks?!
20600a Help me!
20600a Help me!
206008 C'mere, you! Ow! Ow! Whoa!
20600a I'm sorry, Applejack! I dunno how to make it stop!
206008 Well, I know somepony who might!
206003 Three cutie marks. Three talents. I've never seen anything like it! I was just reading something about unusual equine illnesses. What was it?
206005 "Perplexing Pony Plagues", perhaps?
206003 Yes, Spike! You're amazing!
206005 Yes, well, I do have some talents.
206003 Hay fever... the trots... [gasp] Cutie pox!
206107 Cutie pox?!
206003 Cutie pox. This puzzling pony plague afflicted a population of ponies back in the Paleopony Period.
206005 Heh, say that ten times fast!
206000 [crash]
206003 Random cutie marks appeared all over the ponies' bodies, causing them to perform all the talents that came with them.
20600a Just like me!
206008 Yes, but what's the cure? What's the cure?!
206003 It says here there's no known cure!
206107 No known cure?!
206003 The cause of the breakout was never discovered, and the cutie pox disappears as mysteriously as they arrived!
20600a Oh no! Sacré bleu! Plus de marques de cutie! [gasp] Qu'est-ce c'est?! Je parle Français?!
206008 My sister's speakin' in fancy!
206003 She needs help!
206008 I know she needs help! We can't just wait for this to go away! We gotta find somepony to mix up a cure! And fast!
20600a Tout de suite!
206003 Not some pony... some zebra!
206008 Zecora!
206008 Hurry, hurry!
20600a Dépêchez-vous!
206000 [jackhammer sounds]
206000 [accordion playing]
206000 [lions roaring]
20602e She's cursed!
20602f Hexed!
206022 Enchanted!
206005 No, she's not.
206108 [sigh]
206005 She just has some weird mysterious disease with no known cure called cutie pox.
20600f Cutie pox?! [screaming and panicking]
206034 She's got the cutie pox!
206000 [hawk cry]
206047 I thought I had removed their fear the last time that I visited here. But doors are barred and shutters shut. Guess I should've stayed inside my hut.
206003 Zecora! Apple Bloom has cutie pox! We were just on our way to see if you had a cure!
206008 But magically you're here! Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?
206047 My 'zebra sense' did not bring me round, it was a special flower that I needed found. I thought I picked enough to fix all the potions I had to mix, but after my visit from Apple Bloom, some had mysteriously left my room. Apple Bloom! What do you say? Did this flower just walk away?
20600a I, um...
206047 A cutie pox cure I have forsooth, for healing power is in the Seeds of Truth.
206008 Well, well then give 'em to her! Quick!
206047 These seeds must be planted in the ground. With the truth, they'll grow, and the cure is found.
206008 Come again?
206047 The Seeds of Truth do hold the cure, but one must speak words, true and pure.
20600a [gulp]
206008 Well then let's get to it! Alright, they're planted, now somepony tell the truth!
20600a Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
206008 Somepony! Anypony!
206007 Yesterday I told Mrs Cake that I ate two corn cakes, but I really ate three! Okay, six! I ate six corn cakes! [cries] Make it stop! Oh, make it stop!
20600a Wah, I can't stand it any more! It's me! I admit it! I didn't earn my cutie mark! They're all fake! I figured the Heart's Desire would help me get what I wanted most! So when Zecora left her hut, I mixed up a special potion and put the rest of the Heart's Desire in it!
206000 [ponies awing]
20600a [chomps, chews and swallows] Ahh.
206066 Apple Bloom!
206065 Are you okay?
20600a I'm great, and I've never been happier to be a blank flank. But I'm awful sorry I lied, 'specially to you gals. I was so desperate for my cutie mark, I just got carried away. And I'm really sorry I snuck those flowers from you, Zecora. Why, I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted me to come by again.
206047 Now, Apple Bloom, do not be silly. You are always welcome, my little filly. With each mistake you learn something new, growing up into a better you.
206003 Apple Bloom, would you mind writing to Princess Celestia and telling her what you've learned?
20600a I'd be happy to, Twilight! Spike?
206005 Ready!
20600a Dear Princess Celestia,
20600a Waiting for what your heart desires can be really hard. So, you may try to take a shortcut. But this dishonesty never works, because you didn't earn what your heart desired. The only cure is being honest with yourself and others. And that's something every heart desires.
206008 I sure am proud of you, sis. Seems like you finally learned the importance of patience.
20600a Yup. All good things come to those who wait. [pause] Well, I've waited long enough.
206065 Actually, that was way too long.
206008 What?!
20600a So what are we gonna do today to earn our cutie marks?
206065 Well, I was thinking, for a pony who's never mixed up a potion before, you sure stirred up something fierce.
206066 Yeah! So what if your talent is potion making?
20600a Oh my gosh, totally! Let's go talk to Zecora, now!
206066 Yeah!
206065 Woo-hoo!
206000 [music]
206000 [credits]
20700c Ha-ha! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! [laughs] Whoa!
2070c3 [hoots]
20700c Who? Oh, it's you, Owlowiscious. C'mon, try and keep up! [laughs]
207028 [barks]
20700c Winona? I mean... Winona's head?! Um, is this weird, or is it just me? Angel? Gummy?! Okay, this is officially beyond weird now and right on down to freaky town.
20706a [hisses]
20700c [gasp] Yaaaaah!
20700c Whaa!
20706a [yowls]
207028 [barks]
2070c3 [hoots]
20700c Phew.
207000 [theme song]
207028 [barks]
207000 [ponies chattering]
207008 Let's get this thing started!
207007 [giggles]
20700d Sincerest apologies, Rainbow, if our pets were bothering you.
20706a [meow]
20700d Say you're sorry, Opal.
20706a [hisses]
20700d She's... sorry.
20700c What are you all doing out here?
207008 Why, we always round up our critters for a regular ol' Pony Pet Playdate in this park.
20700c Uh, you do?
207008 Same time every week.
20700e I thought you knew. You didn't know? She didn't know?
207003 Well, we had initially planned on inviting Rainbow, of course, except–
207007 We were totally gonna invite you, Rainbow, then Twilight remembered that you don't even have a pet, and Rarity remembered that you really like to take naps in the afternoon, so Applejack figured you wouldn't be missing out on anything anyway, and Fluttershy and I nodded our heads in agreement like this.
20700e Oh, please don't be mad at us.
20700c Oh, I'm not mad. You all are right. Not much point of a Pony Pet Playdate for me if I'm a pony without a pet, right?
207008 Eeexactly. So, if'n you'll excuse us...
207000 [ponies chattering to their pets]
20700c Hey, now wait a minute! Just because I don't have a pet now doesn't mean I never want a pet!
20700e Ohh! Y, y, Oh, really? You really want a pet? Really? 'Cause I've got so many wonderful choices at my house! Oh, and I know you'll just love them! And they'll love you! Oh, and you'll be best friends forever and ever! Oh!
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight
20700e It's abundantly clear
20700e That somewhere out here
20700e Is the pet that will suit you just right
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules
20700c It's of utmost importance
20700c The pet that I get
20700c Is something that's awesome and cool
20700e Awesome, cool, got it!
20700e I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
20700e They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c Cutesy? Wootsie? Have you even met me?
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e Rainbow, have faith
20700e You see, I will bet you
20700e Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you
20700e Come on, the sky's the limit!
20700c Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.
20700e Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you!
20700c Pass.
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide
20700e There are otters and seals
20700e With massive appeal
20700c Otters and seals do not fly.
20700e Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!
207000 [seal barks]
20700c That's it. I'm outta here.
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e Wait! There must be a pet here
20700e That will fit the ticket
20700e How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?
20700c Bigger. And cooler.
20700e Bigger, cooler. Right.
20700e I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash
20700e Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely!
20700c It's just a squirrel.
20700e Not just any squirrel. A flying squirrel!
20700c ...Yeah. So, like I was saying...
20700c Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it
20700c I need a pet to keep up with me
20700c Something awesome, something flying
20700c With coolness that defies gravity!
20700e I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
20700c Ya think?
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky
20700e Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly
20700c Better, but cooler.
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?
20700e There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that
20700e There are falcons and eagles
20700e They are both quite regal
20700e Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?
20700c Now you're talking! But instead of just one standout, now that's too many.
20700c So many choices, and such riches aplenty
20700e Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me.
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too
20700c Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?
20700e No.
20700e I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c What to do, what to do? [gasp]
20700c A prize! That's it! There's really just one way
20700c To find out which animal's best
20700c Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts
20700c That will put each pet to the test
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e Don't forget style, that should be considered
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e The one who is awesomest cool
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c Just like me
20700c Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best
207000 [Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
207000 So a contest we will see
20700c [Rainbow Dash]
20700c Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet
207000 [Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
207000 In the world for me!
20700e [Fluttershy]
20700e May the games
207000 [Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
207000 Begin!
20700c And may the best pet win!
20700c [blows whistle]
207000 [ponies cheering]
20700c [blows whistle] Shh! [to assembled animals] So! You all think you've got what it takes to be my pet, do ya? Well, we'll just see about that! If any of you don't think you can handle it, bow out now before you humiliate yourself in front of your peers. This competition isn't for the weak. You'd better be prepared to step up your game! You call that flapping?! That's better. There's only room on Team Dash for one of you, and my future pet needs to be able to take it to the extreme! Any questions?
207008 I got one. Does she understand what a pet really needs?
207003 Yeah, like care and attention, love and affection– Ugh! And breath mints!
20700e Now, you just pay attention, and try your best, and–
20700c Seriously, Fluttershy! The turtle? What did you bring that thing here for?
20700e Technically he's a tortoise, and he's always dreamed of being somepony's pet. He just wants a chance to compete, he won't get in the way. You won't even know he's here.
20700c No.
20700e Oh, just let him try.
20700c Ugh, but there's no way he can possibly keep up. Look at him!
20700e It won't hurt to let him try.
20700c But–
20700e Just let him try?
20700c Grrgh, ugh, fine! But don't say I didn't warn you! This isn't a game, you know! Alright, now these games will determine which one of you has the most important qualities I'm looking for in a pet. Speed. Agility. Guts. Style. Coolness. Awesomeness. And radicalness.
207003 Aren't those all the same thing?
20700c You would think that, Twilight. And that's why you would never qualify to be my pet.
20700c Speed! On your marks...
207000 [duck quacks]
20700c Get set... [blows whistle] Sorta speedy... not speedy... pretty speedy... could be more speedy...
207000 [falcon cries]
20700c Yeah! That's speed!
207000 [ponies cheering]
20700c [to the tortoise] Tsk-tsk. That's just sad.
20700c Agility! Sorta agile... not agile... pretty agile... could be more agile... [to the tortoise] wanna know the opposite of agility? That.
207000 [ponies cheering]
20700c Yeah, baby, now that's what I call agility! [sing-song voice] Don't leave me hangin'! I'm gonna have to shave a point off your score for that.
20700c Okay! Which of you has the guts to try and get Opal's favorite toy away from her?
20706a [growls]
207000 [toy squeaks]
20700c Now that takes guts!
20706a [yowls]
20700c Style! Any pet of mine's gotta look good, 'cause you gotta make me look good!
20700c Coolness!
207000 [owl hoots]
20700c Sorta cool.
207000 [duck quacks]
20700c Not cool.
207000 [bat cries]
20700c Pretty cool.
207000 [toucan cries]
20700c Could be cooler.
207000 [wasp buzzing]
20700c Not what I had in mind. [to butterfly] I can't hear you!
207000 [tortoise coughs]
20700c Eugh.
207000 [eagle cries]
20700c Now that's a cool sound!
20700c [to bat] Sorta awesome. [to toucan] Not awesome. [to flamingo] Could be more awesome. [to owl] Ho ho ho, yeah, that is awesome! [to tortoise] Uh, you did that already. That's pretty much all you can do, huh?
207000 [My Little Pony theme song plays on glasses]
207000 [bat screeches]
207000 [glasses shatter]
20700c Whoa! That was truly awesome! But I'm afraid this is the radicalness competition, so I'm gonna have to take some points off.
20700c [sigh] Listen, turtle...
20700e Tortoise.
20700c Whatever! You've had your fun, but I think you and I both know who made the cut and who didn't.
207000 [tortoise croaks]
20700c You didn't.
207000 [ponies cheering]
20700c I mean... 'A' for effort and everything, you gave it your best shot, maybe I've got a gold star sticker around here somewhere you can have, but, seriously, go home. You're starting to creep me out. So, anyway, you're all outstanding competitors, but there can only be one of you who's number one. So the final tie-breaking contest is going to be... pause for dramatic effect... a race against... me! Through Ghastly Gorge! Dun dun dun!
207000 [eagle cries]
20700c Gesundheit. Actually, Ghastly Gorge isn't scary. It's fun. Heh. I've flown through it a million times myself, so obviously I'll be at the front of the pack. But whichever of you make it across the finish line with me will have proven you can keep up with me, and will have earned the honor and glory of getting to be my pet! Ready? Setgo! Woo-hoo! Haha! Try to keep up! Can't catch me, ha-ha!
207000 [wind whistling]
20700c [whistles] C'mon, slowpokes! You wanna win, don't ya? Oh! I forgot to tell you! Watch out for the Quarray eels! They don't like it when you get too close to their nests, like this. Whoa.
207000 [Quarray eels growl]
20700c Easy, peasy, one-two-threesy! Right, guys?
207000 [rock cracking]
207000 [rumbling]
20700c AVALANCHE! Hey! Whoaaaa! [grunts] C'mon... no! Wait! Come back! Don't leave me! I'm the one who's supposed to win! I don't wanna end up stuck here... forever! Oh no, nonono, th-this can't be happening. Forever is way too long to be trapped in Ghastly Gorge. I mean, it's like, forever! Somepony! Anypony! Help me!
20700c Wahoo! My prayers have been answered! Oh, thankyouthankyoutha– You?! Oh no! Now I'm not only going to be stuck here forever, I'm gonna be stuck here forever with the most annoying turtle in the world! Gyh, I'm doomed. DOOMED, I tell you!
207000 [ponies cheering]
207000 [cheering slowly dies down]
207003 Hm, something's not right here.
20700e Where's Rainbow Dash?
207008 Great galloping galoshes! There's been an avalanche in there!
207005 Rainbow!
207000 [ponies' concerned chattering]
207007 Wait! Look!
20700e It's the turtle!
207073 Tortoise!
20700e Oh, whatever...
207003 And he's carrying something on his back...
207007 Ahh! It's Rainbow Dash! It's her! It's Rainbow!
207000 [ponies cheering]
207000 [cheering slowly dies down again]
20700e Maybe we'd better go meet him halfway.
207000 [ponies cheering]
207005 Huh. Way to go, little guy!
207003 Oh, thank goodness you're not hurt, Rainbow!
20700c Just my pride.
20700d I certainly hope all of this dreadful dust was worth it! [sneezes]
207008 It sure was, if'n it means Rainbow gets to have her own little critter just like the rest of us from now on.
20700c Uh... thanks. What you did... I owe you one.
20700e Rainbow! Your new pet is over here waiting for you!
207000 [ponies awing]
20700c Oh... right... yeah... that.
207005 What's the matter?
207007 You got your perfect pet, right?
20700e The best of the best like you wanted, remember? It can fly and it's not a squirrel! Should we sing about it again?
207008 A falcon sure looks good on ya, Rainbow.
207000 [camera clicks]
207000 [tortoise yelps]
20700c Easy, fella. Nothing to be afraid of. The falcon sure does look cool... he's absolutely everything I wanted in a pet. [sigh]
20700e Yay?
20700c But I said whoever crosses the finish line with me gets to be my pet.
207007 You did! You did say that! She did say that, that was the rule!
20700c And the only racer who crossed the finish line with me was the one who stopped to save me when I needed help. The tortoise!
207000 [falcon cry]
207003 But what about the–
207008 Wouldja look at that? He even smiles slow.
207012 [laughing]
20700c Spike, take a letter. Dear Princess Celestia,
20700c I used to think that the most important traits to look for in a pet, or any best friend, were all physical competitive abilities. But now I can see how short-sighted and shallow that was.
20706a [growls]
20700c Today I learned what the most important quality really is. A certain kind of spirit. A stick-to-it-ive-ness. A never give up, can-do attitude that's the mark of a real winner. And this tortoise has it.
207003 Tenacity.
20700c Gesundheit. You just can't stop that little guy. He's like a... like a... Tank!
20700e But Rainbow! You didn't want a pet that couldn't fly because it would keep you grounded and hold you back, remember?
20700c Hmm...
207000 [ponies chattering]
20700c Heh. C'mon, Tank! We're gonna be late for our very first Pony Pet Playdate!
207000 [helicopter rotor noise]
207000 [music]
207000 [credits]
208000 [ponies chattering]
208065 Attention, everypony! Attention! The official Rainbow Dash Fan Club will come to order. Let's get right down to our first order of business. I motion that Rainbow Dash be declared the most awesome pony in Ponyville.
208035 I second the motion, and might I add that if you looked up the word 'awesome' in the dictionary, there would be a picture of Rainbow Dash.
208000 [ponies agreeing]
208036 I object!
208000 [ponies gasp]
208036 I think the word 'awesome' is played out! Rainbow Dash deserves better! I motion that we declare her the most stupendous pony!
208065 'Stupendous'? Is that the best you've got? I motion that we declare her... wonderiffic!
208036 Astonishing!
208065 Breathtaking!
208036 Astounding!
208065 Bedazzling!
20800c What about super-ultra-extreme-awesomazing?
208000 [ponies agreeing]
208065 All in favor of declaring Rainbow Dash the most 'super-ultra-extra-uh-whatever you said' pony in all of Ponyville, say 'aye'!
208109 Aye! [cheering]
20800c [giggles]
208000 [theme song]
20800c [sigh] What a beautiful day. There's nothing like a dip in the clouds to make a Pegasus feel super relaxed.
20810a Help! Help! Help! Help!
20800c Looks like my sky swim will have to wait! I'm Rainbow Dash, and I'm here to rescue you!
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c Wow. What's with this crowd? Uh, thanks, everypony. It was really no big deal.
20810a To me it was! You're my hero, Rainbow Dash!
208000 [ponies cheering]
208065 That Rainbow Dash sure is something.
208039 Something special.
20810b [screams]
20810c [crying]
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c [gasps] Oh no! There's something wrong with the baby!
208000 [crowd gasps]
20800c She's not cheering for everypony's favorite hero, Rainbow Dash!
208000 [ponies cheering]
208000 [cameras clicking]
208065 There just aren't enough words in the dictionary to describe Rainbow Dash's awesomeness.
208003 I can think of a few new words.
208008 And I bet 'modest' is not one of them.
208000 [ponies cheering]
208003 No, but she is kinda awesome.
208000 [elderly ponies chattering]
208000 [splintering wood]
20800c Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!
208000 [elderly ponies screaming]
208000 [ponies cheering]
20810d We'd be lost without you!
20810e You're our hero, Rainbow Dash!
2080ec Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
20800c I can't hear you!
2080ec Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
208003 Call me silly, but I think this whole hero thing might be going to Rainbow Dash's head.
208007 You may be right... silly.
20800c And then I zoomed into the well. I knew it would be dark and dangerous, but I didn't let that stop me. Danger's my middle name. Rainbow 'Danger' Dash. Thinking back on it, I acted pretty awesomely heroic that day.
208005 That day.
208008 Awesomely heroic that day and awesomely arrogant ever since.
208054 Mm-hm.
20800c Hey, Applejack. How'd you like to be immortalized as my friend?
208008 Immorta-what?
208000 [camera clicking]
208003 Are you taking notes?
208005 Yup! I've been hoof-picked by Rainbow Dash herself, to write her autobiography!
208003 Umm, autobiographies are supposed to be written by the pony they are about.
20800c Maybe for your normal, run-of-the-mill ponies. But I'm far too busy saving lives to stop and write. That's why I hired Spike as my ghost writer.
208007 [yelps] Spike's a ghost!
20800c ...Anyway. Spike here writes down everything I say. Don't you, Spike?
208005 Don't... you... Spike. Got it!
20800c This way, I can stay focused on performing those acts of bravery that nopony else has the guts to perform. Yep, it takes guts. But it also takes brains. And sometimes a big lunch and a nap. Being a hero is surely not for everypony, but I'm up to the challenge.
20800c [grunts] There you go.
20810f Someday, I wanna be just like you!
20800c Aim high, kid, but don't aim for the impossible.
2080a7 [screams]
208000 [ponies gasp]
2080a7 Help! Help!
208036 Uh, don't you think you should go and help?
20800c [muffled] Yeah, yeah. I've got a good ten seconds to spare. Just a couple more.
208005 The tension is unbearable. Will Rainbow Dash make it on time?
208000 [ponies cheering]
208034 Holy turnips, that pony came outta nowhere!
208022 I've never seen such bravery in all my life!
208010 That's right! Ponyville has a new hero. A mysterious mare that has done well by our fair city today. I dub this new masked hero 'The Mysterious Mare Do Well'!
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c Mare Do Well, huh? Well that mare would do well to stay outta my way! Ponyville's only got room for one hero, and that hero is me!
208000 [ponies screaming]
20800c [clears throat] Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow–
208110 Excuse me, uh, do you think you could skip your catchphrase and just hurry up and save us?!
20800c Ugh, fine! Picky, picky. Whoaaaa! Aah!
208000 [ponies cheering]
208111 [kissing] Oh, thank you, Mare Do We— e...
20800c I can't believe it. Mare Do Well is stronger than me? Well, a hero is more than just muscle, and she's gonna learn that the hard way.
208000 [jackhammer and drills]
208112 Huh?
20800c Huh? Never fear, your friendly neighbor– Whoa!
208000 [building creaking]
208000 [crashing]
20800c Never fear– Uh! I'm coming! Hold on! Whoa!
208113 Look!
208112 [cheers]
208114 Look out for the– Watch out for falling– On your left! Agh! Your other left!
20800c Here ya go, safe and sound.
208000 [crash]
208114 [faints]
20800c Well, Mare Do Well, or should I call you Mare Do Slow? You're gonna have to pick up the pace if you wanna compete with me, 'cause I move like lightning.
208115 Actually, she saved all of us! We owe her our lives!
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c [growls] Okay. She's strong, fast, and somehow knows what's gonna happen ahead of time. I've gotta step up my game.
208000 [water rushing]
20800c [gasps] If the dam breaks, the whole town will be flooded! Looks like Ponyville needs a hero! Easy peasy.
208000 [stone cracking]
20800c My game is officially back on. If only somepony were here to pat me on the back. Eh, guess I'll have to do it myself– [yelps] [screams] Help! [spits] Help! You?! I suppose you want me to thank– You gotta be kidding me...
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c Lemme get this straight. She's strong, she's agile, and she's magic? Ughhh! How do I compete with that? Wait a minute. I do have a leg up on her. And that leg is... wings! Hah! Take that, Mare Do Well!
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c Oh, for the love of Pete.
208008 Gotta hand it to the girl, that Mare Do Well sure can pull off some pretty heroic feats.
208003 I must say, I was impressed by that spell she used to fix the dam. Seems like something like that would take quite a bit of study.
20800c [growls]
20800e She really cares about everypony's safety.
20800d Have you seen her costume? It is to die for! If you ask me she's a hero of fashion.
208008 And she's modest and humble. She lets her actions speak for themselves. Gotta admire that.
20800c I don't have to admire that! I don't think she's all that great!
208005 She's... great.
20800c I didn't say that.
208003 Sounds like somepony's jealous.
20800c Who, me?
208005 Rainbow Dash is jealous.
20800c Don't write that, Spike!
208000 [others laughing]
208005 Correction - Rainbow Dash is very jealous.
20800c Fine! Laugh all you want, but I'll be the one laughing when I prove to you all that I'm just as good– no, that I'm a better hero than Mare Do Well!
20800c Huh, no sign of trouble here. Darn it. Buses and baby carriages are always careening down this hill. Where is an out-of-control vehicle when you need one?! Rrgh, there are absolutely no freak natural disasters going on anywhere! How am I supposed to prove myself when everything's so normal and safe? [gasps] Hold it right there, Granny Smith! You don't have to pretend with me. I can see that you're in way over your head here.
208009 Eh, what's that?
20800c You're putting on a brave face, I get it. But you don't have to anymore. I'll help you cross the street!
208009 [grunting] Actually, I can cross the street just fine!
20800c Don't worry! You're in extremely... capable... hooves!
208009 [panicked grunts] Back off!
20800c [pants] Here we are! Safe and sound. A good and heroic citizen deserves a little recognition, don't you think?
208009 I didn't wanna cross the street in the first place! [muttering]
208116 [grunting]
20800c [gasps] Somepony's in trouble!
208116 [grunting]
20800c You'd better let me handle this, ma'am! For your own safety, I must ask you to stand back!
208116 Oh, brother.
20800c [cracks neck] [grunting] Ta-da!
208116 Uh... thanks.
20800c How would you describe what I just did? Would you say I was amazing?
208116 Aren't you milking this a bit?
20800c Please, just answer the question! Was I, or was I not, amazing?
208116 Oh, you're amazing alright. An amazingly–
20800c Oh, look!
208000 [lawnmower rattling]
20800c Another great feat of heroism! I have just saved that grass!
208117 From what?
20800c From weeds! Weeds that were attempting to eat this lawn!
208118 Lame...
208034 Whatever.
20800c Aww, who am I kidding?
208000 [thundercloud rumbles throughout]
20800c All anypony talks about is Mare Do Well this and Mare Do Well that! What about me? How could everypony forget about me so easily? I mean... have I changed? Same sleek body. Same flowing mane. Same spectacular hooves. Nope, I'm still awesome. They're wrong. But... then... why am I all alone? I hate being all alone.
208065 Hey, Rainbow Dash!
20800c I knew it! No need to apologize, squirt. Anypony could make that mistake.
208065 Mistake? What mistake?
20800c Wait a minute. Why are you here?
208065 To invite you to join us! We're heading off to the thank you parade for Ponyville's greatest hero, Mare Do Well.
20800c No! No way! Can't you see I-I wanna be alone? I love being alone.
208065 Oh, okay. See you later then.
20800c Yeah, right, like I'm gonna thank her. [mockingly] Thank you, Mare Do Well, whoever you are, for ruining e– [normal] Hey, squirt! Wait up!
208010 Welcome to Ponyville's first, but surely not last, thank you parade, in honor of our city's greatest hero, the mysterious Mare Do Well!
208000 [ponies cheering]
20800c The mysterious Mare Do Well, huh?
208000 [ponies gasp]
20800c So what are you hiding? Let's see how mysterious you are without that mask!
208119 [whistles]
20800c What the hay?
208119 [whistles]
20800c Grrr... I got you now! Alright, Miss Mysterious! Mystery... solved! [yelps] P-p-p-p- Pinkie?! Whudda- hud-d-duh- hud-d-duh- huh?! Twilight?! Applejack?! There were three of you?!
208003 Yup, we all played Mare Do Well at different times.
208008 I stopped the carriage bus with these babies, Bucky McGillicuddy and Kicks McGee.
208007 I saved the construction workers with my Pinkie Sense. [twitches]
208000 [flowerpot shatters]
2080a7 Sorry!
208007 It's alright.
208003 And I used my magic to fix the dam.
20800e Ooh, ooh! And I did the flyby afterwards.
20800d I made the costumes. Fabulous if I do say so myself!
20800c I don't understand. Why? Don't you want me to be a hero?
208003 Of course we want you to be a hero.
208008 But a real hero doesn't brag.
20800c Uh, I guess I did start to brag a little.
20811a A little?!
20800c Okay, a lot.
208003 Celebrating your accomplishments is natural. But...
208008 ...Rubbin' them in everypony's face is not.
208007 Yeah, the only thing that should be rubbed in anypony's face is chocolate cake. [slurp]
208008 I think we're getting off topic here.
208003 What we're trying to say is, it's great to be really good at something, but it's important to act with grace and humility.
20800c Ohhhh. That makes loads more sense. Yeah. You're right. And I guess I should've also acted with grace and humility when others outshine me. Like Mare Do Well.
208003 Sounds like you've got a letter to write to Princess Celestia.
208005 Already got it covered. As your ghost writer, I've already penned a letter to the Princess.
20800c That's nice of you, Spike, but I really wanna write this letter myself.
208005 Aww, come on, I wrote the whole thing already!
20800c Okay, let's hear it.
208005 [clears throat] Dear Princess Cel-
20800c Look out! It's a real ghost!
20811b [yelping and screaming]
20811c [laughing]
208000 [music]
208000 [credits]
20900d [gasp] Here? I get to stay here?
209019 Twilight Sparkle said you were coming to Canterlot for a visit and asked if I might accommodate you.
20906a [purring]
20900d Thank you so much, Princess.
209019 You're very welcome.
20900d No, really. This is so nice of you.
209019 It's nothing, really.
20900d Oh, but it isn't nothing, it's everything! I, I just don't know what to say but thank you, thank you! [kiss] Thank you! [kiss] Thank you! [kiss] Thank you, thank you, thank you! [more kisses]
209019 You are very we—
20900d Thank you!
20911d [pant] Your luggage, mademoiselle?
209019 I'll leave you to get settled.
20911d Your highness.
209019 Enjoy your stay.
20900d Thank you!
20911d [straining] Where would you like me to put these?
20900d That's perfect.
209000 [theme song]
20900d Opal, do you know what I love about Canterlot? [sip] Ahh. Everything! I may have been born in Ponyville, but I am a Canterlot pony at heart. [sip] Now, I know that we are here to pick up some fabrics for the shop, but Twilight was such a dear to get me that suite at the castle, I simply must make her something to express my gratitude. Hmm... ooh! An outfit for her birthday party this weekend! Perfect! Don't you just love it here, Opalescence? [sip]
20911e Please excuse our interruption. I'm Jet Set, and this is my wife Upper Crust. We saw you from across the cafe and just had to find out...
20911f ...Where did you get that simply marvelous chapeau?
20900d Oh, this old thing? Oh, it's just something I—
209120 Rarity! Hey, Rarity! Whoo! It's me, Hayseed Turnip Truck! We met at the big hoedown in Ponyville last fall?
20900d Oh, yes, of course... how are you?
209120 Good! Real good!
209000 [crash]
209121 Hmm...
20911e You're from... Ponyville?
20900d Well, yeah, yes, but—
209120 She sure is! She's a real big-time fancy pants dressmaker there! Probably made that real purty thing she's got on her head!
20911f I thought it looked a little... country.
20911e I told you it wasn't something you could get here in Canterlot, dear.
209121 Hmph!
209120 Well, they seemed real nice.
20900d [sigh]
20900d "Looked a little country". "Not something you can get in Canterlot". I'll show you something worthy of Canterlot!
20900d [panting] I have to get started right away. This new design is very ambitious, and I've already written to Twilight to let her know she'll have something beyond fabulous to wear to her party. [gasps] Fancy Pants!
209122 I say, that's one way to make an introduction.
20900d Oh, goodness, I am so sorry. I didn't see you there. I've just got so many bags and I was trying to get back to my suite at the castle and—
209122 You're staying at the castle?
20900d Wh— The Princess invited me to stay in one of the suites.
209122 You know the Princess?
209123 Hmm, a pony with expensive tastes, I see.
20900d Oh, it's for an ensemble I'm making for a friend. Her birthday is in a few days. [pants] Again, I am really sorry I bumped into you.
209122 I'm not! Heheh, you are obviously somepony worth bumping into! Listen, I have a VIP box reserved at the Wonderbolts Derby this afternoon. Would you... would you be so kind as to join me and a few of my companions there?
20900d Me?
209122 But of course, my dear.
20900d Well, I'm, uh, ah— no— sure.
209122 We'd love to see you there, uh...?
20900d Rarity.
209122 Rarity.
20900d Pro - Seeing the Derby from a VIP box is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Con - Going to the Derby cuts into the amount of time I have to finish Twilight's outfit. Pro - Fancy Pants is the most important pony in Canterlot. His stamp of approval could mean big things for me here. Con - Twilight's party might not be as sophisticated as the Derby, but that doesn't mean I shouldn't put all of my energy into creating her birthday ensemble. My Ponyville friends will appreciate my hard work more than anypony. I'd hate to let them down. And I won't. Opal, I am going to the Wonderbolts Derby as a guest of Fancy Pants! [excited giggling]
20900d Pardon me. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me!
209122 Rarity, jolly good to see you! So glad you could make it.
20900f [chattering]
209122 Everypony, this is Rarity. She's staying at Canterlot Castle.
20900f [gasp, confused chattering]
209124 Fillies and gentlecolts, welcome to the Wonderbolts Derby! The competitors are taking their places at the starting line, and the race will begin momentarily!
209122 I'll be rooting for Rapidfire, of course. He's sure to take home the grand prize.
20900f [agreeing]
20900d I don't think he has a chance against Fleetfoot.
20900f [gasp]
209000 [fanfare]
209000 [whistle]
209124 And it's Fleetfoot by a nose!
20900d [cheers]
209122 Bravo, Rarity! I say, how did you know Fleetfoot would be victorious?
20900d My friend Rainbow Dash talks about her all the time. She says what Fleetfoot lacks in size, she makes up for in speed.
209125 And who is this 'Rainbow Dash'?
20900d Uh... [gulps] Why... she's... she's the... the Wonderbolts' trainer, of course.
209122 Staying at Canterlot Castle and she knows the Pegasus training the Wonderbolts. I told you all this was an important pony.
20900f [chattering]
209122 Three cheers for Rarity, my new favorite party guest!
20900f Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray! Hip hip, hooray!
20900d ...And then I said, "Puh-lease, that isn't a hat, darling, that's a natural disaster that somehow landed atop your head!"
209000 [ponies laughing]
209125 Oh, you are a delight, Rarity, an absolute delight. You simply must attend my art gallery opening this evening. [laughs]
20900d Oh, I'd love to, but I—
209126 And let's not forget my charity auction tomorrow morning.
20900d Well, that sounds wonderful, but I—
209127 And of course there's a seat for you at my dinner party tomorrow night.
20900d I'm flattered, really. It's just I have a project I really need to get started on, and-
209125 Oh, but Rarity! I may as well close down the whole gallery if you can't attend!
209126 My auction is for charity, dear. For charity...
209127 And my dinner party will be a disaster if you don't come.
20900d ...of course I'll be there.
209125 Wonderful!
209126 Oh, thank goodness!
209127 Disaster averted!
20900d Looks like we'll be spending a few more days here, Opalescence. Turns out bumping into Fancy Pants like that was the best thing that's ever happened to me. Of course, finishing Twilight's dress in time for her birthday party is still my top priority, but I can't possibly disappoint the Canterlot elite by rejecting their invitations now, can I?
20900d [Rarity]
20900d I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go
20900d I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know
20900d I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow
20900d I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know
20900d Becoming as popular as popular can be
20900d Making my mark, making my mark in high society
20900d I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah
20900d I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know
20900d See how they hang on every word that I speak
20900d My approving glance is what they all seek
20900d I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe
20900d I'm the type of pony every pony should know
20900d At home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht
20900d Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot
20900d I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe, yeah
20900d I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know
20900d Because I'm the type of pony
20900d Yes, I'm the type of pony
20900d Yes, I'm the type of pony every pony should know
20900d Oh, I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
20911d Me... too...
20900d We'd better get going.
20906a [yowls]
20900d I must get back to Ponyville with enough time to finish Twilight's ensemble.
209000 [letterbox clicks]
20900d For me? Dearest Rarity, your presence is requested at the Canterlot garden party tomorrow afternoon. Yours, Jet Set and Upper Crust! [gasps] The Canterlot garden party! Why, next to the Galloping Gala that is the premier event in Canterlot! [squeals] Oh, but if I go, I'll miss Twilight's birthday... But if I don't go, my new reputation in Canterlot as a Very Important Pony might be ruined! I might never be invited to another high society event again! Friend's birthday... Very Important Pony... [winces] It's just too important. [takes deep breath] My dear Twilight, I am afraid I won't be able to make it to your birthday party tomorrow, because... because poor Opal is quite ill, and she is in no condition to make the long journey back to Ponyville! I do hope you understand. Your friend, Rarity.
20911d I suppose this means you don't need me to bring down your bags?
20900d No. But, I will need some help unpacking them.
20911d Oomph!
20906a [yowls]
20900d What do you think? Too much? You're right. Too little. Ah, garden party, here I come!
20906c Surprise!
20900d [gasps]
209007 [fades in] Swoosh! And right before she hit the ground, shoom, she— Hi again!
20900d What are you— how did you— Why are you—
209008 Listen to her. She's so excited to see us, she can hardly talk.
20900d What I mean to say is, what are you all doing here?
209003 When I got your letter saying you were stuck in Canterlot, I asked Pinkie Pie if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move my birthday party here, so you wouldn't have to miss it!
209007 Balloons are super easy to pack.
209000 [balloons deflate]
20900d Wow... First you get me a suite at Canterlot Castle and now this. I don't know what to say, Twilight.
20900c How about you start by saying what you're doing in that fancy getup?
20900d This? Uh- well, I- I always put on something a little fancy when Opal's feeling under the weather... Cheers her right up. [laughs nervously]
20900e Oh, poor Opal. Where is the sick darling?
20900d Oh, uhh, she's... Hold on a minute.
209000 [doors slam]
20906c Huh?
20906a [yowls]
20900d I am so sorry about this.
209000 [running water]
20906a [more yowling]
20900d She's resting on the bed.
20900e Poor baby.
20906a [more yowling]
20900e She looks awful.
20906a [growls]
209003 Is... that my dress?
20900d Yes.
209003 It's so... simple. So practical. So me! It's the perfect dress for my birthday party! I love it!
20900d [sighs in relief] You don't know how glad I am to hear you say that.
209003 When I told the princess that I was moving the party to Canterlot, she was kind enough to offer us the Canterlot Castle ballroom!
209007 Isn't it fancy pants?
20900d Fancy Pants?! Where?! Ahh, I mean, where did you find the time to put up all these decorations? Ha-ha. [chirp]
209007 Oh, I never leave home without my party cannon!
209000 [explosion]
209000 [party blowers blow]
209007 Ta-da!
209003 I thought about having my birthday outside, but they're having another party on the castle grounds today.
209000 [ponies chattering]
209007 Let's party!
209000 [swing music]
20900d Mmh... No reason I can't at least make an appearance...
209000 [classical music]
20900d I'm here!
20911f Darling, I'm so glad you made it.
209122 Rarity! So happy to see you here.
20900d I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
209122 [sniffs] I say, what is that scent you're wearing? It smells like... [sniffs] Is that cake frosting?
20900d ...Yes, I always dab a little frosting behind my ears before I go out. [laughs nervously] After all, who doesn't like the smell of cake frosting?
209122 I know I do.
20911f Mm-hmm.
20900d [sighs] Well, all this talk about cake has made me hungry. Think I'll go and see what's on the hors d'oeuvre table. If you'll excuse me...
209128 [chatting]
209128 [chatting]
20900d [chokes]
20900d I think I left the bathwater running in my suite.
20900d I really should go check on Opal...
20900d Is that Princess Celestia?
20900d [hushed] I need to use the little fillies' room!
209003 [blows party trumpet]
20900d Can I get anypony more punch?
20900d I... have to go to do the... thing with the... stuff... you know...? [trails off]
20900c Uh, what's with the croquet mallet?
20900d [muffled] What croquet mallet?
20900c Duh, the one in your mouth!
20900d [laughs nervously] Ooh, that croquet mallet. I- well I, you know, the truth is... the truth is...
209003 Were you at that other party in the garden?
20900d I, I...
209003 Rarity, I'm surprised at you.
20900d Twilight let me explain! I—
209003 I hadn't realized you were such a savvy businesspony!
20900d You must understand! I—
209003 All of those ponies look so posh. And with the Grand Galloping Gala coming up, I bet you could totally get some of them to buy your dresses. Very smart!
20900d Woo, wwwhy yes, I-I didn't want you to think I was being rude, so that's exactly the reason I didn't tell you. The one and only reason. [laughs nervously]
209003 Oh, well, you didn't have to do that. You should totally go over there and mingle!
20900d Twilight, you really are the best friend a pony could ever ask for. I don't know why I ever thought you wouldn't understand.
209003 Understand what?
20900d Nothing. See you girls later!
20900c Hey, wait up! We're your friends! I'm sure they won't mind if we check out the party too! C'mon, you guys! Let's show them how to party Ponyville style!
20900d Oh no!
209000 [explosion]
209000 [party blowers blow]
209000 [birds chirping]
209007 Mmm!
209008 How come y'all aren't doing any gardening? This is a garden party, isn't it?
20900d [sip]
20911e Can you believe what that pony is wearing?
20911f It's just so plain.
20900d [nervous laugh] Yeah.
209122 Excuse me, might I ask where you got your ensemble?
209003 Why, yes! Yes, you may. A very, very close friend of mine from Ponyville made it for me.
20900d [spits]
209122 Ponyville? You don't say?
209003 I do say. Her name is—
20900d Fancy Pants! Come with me! I'd like to show you this, er, thing that's over there. On the other side of the room.
209122 In a moment, my dear. This lovely filly from Ponyville was just about to tell me who made her charming dress.
20900d That dress? Oh come now, who cares, it's just a plain old—
209003 Oh, don't be so modest! This dress you made is beautiful!
209000 [ponies gasp]
209000 [glass shattering]
209003 We all think so!
209122 [to Rarity] You know these ponies?
209000 [ponies chattering]
20900d Yes. Yes, I do know them. They may not be as sophisticated as some of you Canterlot ponies, but they are my best friends. And they are without a doubt the most important ponies I know.
20911e Important ponies? These ruffians?
20911f Don't make me laugh!
209121 [laughing]
209122 I, for one, find them charmingly rustic.
209000 [ponies gasp]
209122 And I think the dress you made for your friend is lovely. [chuckle] I dare say every mare in Canterlot will be wanting one.
20911f Oh, I'd like to place my order right now.
20911e I think you should get two.
209122 Er, yes, now then. How about you introduce me to your friends?
20900d With pleasure!
20900d Dear Princess Celestia,
20900d I wanted to tell you about the important lesson I learned during my visit.
209019 Now that I would like to hear.
20900d I learned that no matter where you go in life, you should never forget that you are the product of your home and your friends. And that is something always to be proud of, no matter what.
209019 Hm, a very valuable lesson to have learned.
20911d It certainly is! But... might I ask that we hurry things up a bit?! Oh no!
209000 [music]
209000 [credits]
210003 No distractions. Today is too important. Re-shelving day! Understanding Medieval Equestria goes in Pony History. Modern Spellcasting. That's Classics. The Art of the To-Do List... actually, I kinda wanna read that again.
210005 [chuckling]
210003 Spike! What are you laughing at?
210005 This little beauty is my birthday present to myself! It's a fire ruby! I've been aging it for months, and it's almost ripe!
210000 [tuning fork pings]
210005 [giggles] Hey, you took my advice—just use the whole floor as one big shelf!
210003 [growls]
210000 [theme song]
21000d [muffled] Hellooo? [normal] Anypony home? Twilight? [gasps] Is that a fire ruby?! Huh, that must be at least twenty carats! No inclusions, pristine facets...
210005 And totally delicious.
210003 Uhh... if you guys don't mind?
21000d Oh, uh, of course. I just came by to see if you had any books on historical fashion... [to Spike] Did you say... delicious?
210005 Sure did! Next week's my birthday, and this is my birthday dinner.
210003 Start with this one.
21000d Thanks, Twilight. I've got a feeling ruffled taffeta capes are going to make a huge comeback this season, and I want to be ahead of the game... [to Spike] I hope it's as tasty as it is beautiful, Spike. I've never seen anything quite so stunning before.
210005 Gosh... You really like it, huh?
21000d Like it? It's magnificent.
210005 [sighs] Then you should have it. This beautiful gem was meant to be with you.
21000d I don't know what to say... this is so thoughtful. Oh, my little Spikey-wikey! [kisses] Thank you so much!
210003 Wow, Spike, that's one of the kindest, most generous things you've ever done. I've never seen Rarity so happy!
210005 I will never wash this cheek again. [sighs and laughs]
210003 Just about finished, Spike? Everypony will be here soon.
210005 There. Perfect! Everything looks perfect!
210003 Not quite everything.
210005 A washcloth? I don't get it. Ah, no way, Twilight! I said I wasn't gonna wash the cheek that Rarity kissed, and I meant it!
210003 It's over, Spike! I'm cleaning that cheek!
210005 [gasps for breath] It's mine! Stop it!
210003 Never!
210005 Twilight...!
210007 [blows party hooter] Happy birthday!
210000 [trumpet fanfare]
210007 Party time, woo-hoo!
210005 Are those... for me?
210008 You bet they are, birthday boy.
21000e Happy birthday, Spike.
210000 [crash]
21000c Don't you know you get presents on your birthday?
210005 Well, actually, this is my first birthday in Ponyville... I usually just get one present... from Twilight. A book.
210000 [sheep bleating]
21000d Speaking of presents, this is from my new line of taffeta capes. I'm going to make one for each of you!
21006c [Wow, they're great, etc.]
21000d I've been inspired by the generosity of my little Spikey-wikey, who gave me this beautiful fire ruby, one of the kindest acts I've ever experienced. Mmm.
210005 Applejack, I can't thank you enough for this great blanket. I really needed a new one.
210008 C'mon, Spike, you already thanked me fifteen times. I'm startin' to get a little embarrassed.
210005 I know I keep thanking you guys, but I'm just so grateful. I wish this party could last forever.
210000 [balloon pops]
210007 Duh! The party can't last forever 'cause you have to go to Sugarcube Corner, 'cause the Cakes said they have a special surprise for you, 'cause it's your birthday!
210005 No way!
210007 I said the party couldn't last forever, but it doesn't need to end right now!
210000 [door slams]
210005 Hi, Mr and Mrs Cake!
21002b There's the dragon of the hour! Happy birthday, Spike!
210005 Thanks!
21002a When we found out it was your birthday, we couldn't resist trying out a new recipe - sapphire!
210005 Wow!
210005 Thank you so much! Man, first I get a bunch of great presents from my best friends, and now an amazing sapphire cupcake! Hohoh, what a day! Whoa! Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Cheerilee!
21005b That's okay. What's got you so excited?
210005 [chomps] [muffled] Pinkie Pie told me I should come see the Cakes, so they could give me a cake 'cause it's my birthday today.
21005b Well, happy birthday, Spike! I wish I had something to give you! Uh... Oh! Here you go!
210005 Wow, really?
21005b Sure! Everypony should get fun gifts on their birthday! Have a great birthday, Spike.
210005 I wish every day was my birthday...
210005 Pinkie Pie mentions my birthday to the Cakes, and I get a cupcake. I mention it to Cheerilee, and I get this great hat.
210000 [ball bouncing]
210005 Hmmm, I wonder... Hey there, Lickety Split! That's a pretty cool ball you got there! Did you know it's my birthday?
210000 [ball bouncing]
210005 [laughs] This is unbelievable! [chuckles] Hey, Junebug! It's my birthday!
210129 Happy birthday, Spike.
210005 Aren't you gonna give me something? You know, like a birthday present?
210129 Um, I... I don't have anything.
210005 Well, how about those flowers? I'll take those–
210003 Spike! Uh, sorry, Junebug, I think Spike might've gotten a little carried away.
210129 Uh, no problem... H-Happy birthday, Spike!
210003 What are you doing? You're out here demanding gifts now?
210005 Wow, you're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. Thanks for snapping me out of it. I'd better go give Cheerilee her hat back.
210003 No problem. See you at home later?
210005 Sounds good! Bye! [chuckles] Who else has a present for 'Spikey-wikey'? [hisses]
210003 Wow, what a rough night's sleep, Spike. I had the weirdest drea–
210005 [snoring]
210003 I can't believe you! Where'd you get all this– [gasps]
210000 [clatter]
210005 [yawns/hisses] What happened?
210005 What's happening to me, Twilight?!
210003 I don't know! Think back to last night. Did something happen? Spike? What did you do after I saw you?
210005 I went to talk... to...
210003 Spike!
210005 Huh?
210003 You went to talk to who?
210005 Oh, um... I don't remember. Hey, can I have that globe? You're not using it, right?
210003 Huh?
210000 [crash]
210005 What about this book?
210003 Spike, I'm worried about you. You're usually not so... grabby!
210005 My arms aren't usually [voice drops] this long either. What's happening to me?
210003 [slaps]
21012a Well now, what seems to be the problem?
210003 This is Spike. [slaps] And something's wrong with him. [slaps] He used to be half this size! And he keeps trying to take things that aren't [slaps] his!
21012a All right then, let's just have a look see, shall we? Widdle guy not feewing too good? Who's a brave widdle boy, huh? Who's a brave one?
210000 [rushing fire]
210003 So? What do you think, Doctor?
21012a Well, I think I know what the problem is. He's a dragon!
210003 That's not the problem. He's always been a dragon.
21012a Oh. Well, that would explain it. Listen, I don't know anything about dragons, I know about baby ponies. Maybe you should try a vet.
210003 [sighs] Okay. Thank you, doctor.
21012b Hm, well, I'm flummoxed. Y'bring me a dog, I've got it diagnosed in seconds. Snake even faster, but... to be honest, I've never seen a real live dragon before.
210005 [snorts]
21012b Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Sit.
210005 [pants]
210003 Thanks anyway. C'mon, Spike.
210000 [squee, squeaks]
210000 [watch ticking]
210000 [slap]
210047 Ooh, he is starting to mature. Of this fact I am quite sure.
210003 Mature? So he's just... growing up? But that doesn't explain why he keeps grabbing things.
210047 A dragon's heart is prone to greed, a steady diet to make growth speed. Then, the resulting bigger size only makes their hunger rise. If this trait should go unchecked, if Spike continues to collect, more growth will certainly occur – he is going to turn into a monster.
210003 [gasps] You mean the more things a dragon collects, the bigger and greedier he gets? But how do we stop him before he's completely out of control?
210047 If his monstrous ways you wish to impede, you must prevent him from practicing greed.
210003 [laughs nervously]
21000a Get away from her, you brute!
210005 Spike want!
210065 You're not getting my scooter!
210005 Spike want!
210003 Hey, Spike! Check out this amazing broom!
210005 Spike want! [hisses] [roaring]
210003 [sing-song voice] C'mon, big boy! Look at this incredible broom!
210005 Spike want!
210000 [crashing]
210003 Fight all you want, I'm not letting you out! Oh, Spike, I just re-shelved this room!
210000 [door closes]
210000 [crash]
210003 [groans] What now?
210008 Now who in Ponyville would steal my apples? For that matter, who would steal my leaves?
210003 Applejack, help! Spike's running wild and I need you to lasso him!
210008 [laughs] Oh, that's a good one, Twilight. Sweet little Spike, running wild. Ha, what a laugh.
210005 [stomping]
210008 Twilight, get my rope.
210005 [roars]
21001c Help!
21000c Huh? [laughs] Don't tell me! You-you tied yourselves up?
210008 Get us out of here right now!
21000e [screams]
210008 [gasps] What was that?
21000c Sounded like Fluttershy to me!
210003 Fluttershy? Fluttershy?!
21000e I'm up here!
210003 What happened?
21000e I was helping my squirrel friends with a dance step, and all of a sudden, a giant, r-rampaging d-d-d-dragon stormed through!
210003 That was Spike!
21000e Spike? But why would Spike steal my chicken coop? He just pulled it out of the ground and filled it with a bunch of apples and stuff!
210007 [screams]
21000c That sounded like Pinkie Pie!
210003 C'mon, girls!
210007 Back! Get back!
210005 [hisses]
210007 [grunting]
210000 [pie splats]
210003 Pinkie Pie! Stop giving him cake!
210007 I'm not giving him cake, I'm assaulting him with cake!
210005 [grunts]
210007 How dare you take the cake!
210005 [roars]
210000 [crash]
210005 [stomping]
210003 He's completely out of control! Who knows where he'll go next!
21000d [hums] Hm, perhaps some more ruffle. [screams]
210000 [air raid siren]
210000 [ponies screaming]
210005 [roars]
21000d [screams]
210005 [roars]
210000 [splash]
210000 [ponies screaming]
21000d Put me down, you brute!
210005 [roars]
21000d How rude.
21000e Don't worry Rarity, we'll save you!
21000c Put her down, right now!
21000e I-If you wouldn't mind, that is...
21000c I mean it, dragon boy!
21000e We'll be ever so grateful if you'd be so kind as to possibly consider...
21000c Drop her, scaly!
21000d Hey! I'm– not some– sort of common– fly swatter!
21012c [screaming]
210000 [splash]
21000d Girls! My cape!
210005 [roars]
21000c Look! The Wonderbolts!
210005 [growls]
21000d [screams]
210005 [begins to roar]
21000d Oh, be quiet. You've got nothing to be proud of. You steal everypony's things, terrorize the town, and use me as a weapon against my own friends! Which, as horrible as it is, I can almost understand because you're a dragon and all. But this! [rips off dress] This is a crime against fashion! Oh no. You are not getting this gemstone! This was given to me by my dear friend Spikey-wikey, the kindest, sweetest, most generous dragon ever. And it is too precious to me to give to a greedy old beast like you!
210005 [grunts]
21012d Here, Rarity, you take it. It would mean even more to see you happy than to eat it myself.
21012e I... I don't know what to say. This is just so generous. [kisses]
21000d Oh, what now? I suppose you'll be eating me or something? Spike?! You're the rampaging dragon?!
21012f [screaming]
210007 Somepony do something!
21000c On it!
210000 [wind rushing]
210005 Rarity? I need to tell you something! Just in case we don't make it! I've always sort of had a crush–
21000e [gasps] We did it! I can't believe we did it!
210000 [crash]
21000c All in a day's work.
21000d Spike, I just have to tell you how absolutely proud I am of you.
210005 Proud of me?
21000d Yes. It was you who stopped... w-well, you, from destroying Ponyville. You are my hero, Spikey-wikey! [kisses]
210005 Dear Princess Celestia,
210005 Today I learned a great lesson about friendship. Well, you might think that it would feel good to get lots and lots of stuff, but it doesn't feel nearly as good as giving something special to somepony you really care about. But I learned that it truly is better to give than to receive, and that kindness and generosity are what lead to true friendship. And that's more valuable than anything in the world. Well... almost anything.
210000 [kiss]
210000 [music]
210000 [credits]
211000 [train whistle]
211003 We're getting closer!
21100c I can hardly wait!
21100e I'm so excited, I— I feel like shouting! [softly] Woo-hoo!
211008 Hooo-wee! Canterlot, here we come!
21100d Oh, I do hope I look festive enough!
211007 There it is! Canterlot!
211012 Oooh...
211003 Oh, isn't Canterlot wonderful this time of year?
21100c Yeah, I wish it was Hearth's Warming Eve every day.
211008 There's so much to look at! I feel like my durned eyes are gonna pop right out of my head!
211003 I have an idea, let's play 'I spy with my little eye' as we walk! I'll go first. I spy... an eight-foot candy cane.
21100c I spy a snowpony!
211007 I spy somepony eating a gingerbread house...
211000 [cash register ringing]
211007 [munching] ...and it's me!
211012 [laughs]
211000 [theme song]
211000 [ponies chattering]
211000 [orchestra warming up]
211003 I can't believe that Princess Celestia chose us to put on the most important play of the season! Do you guys know what an honor this is? For all of us?
21100e Oh, I wish she hadn't honored me quite so much... I can't go onstage! I don't want everypony looking at me!
21100d Fluttershy, darling, there's nothing to feel nervous about.
21100e No?
21100d Of course not. All across Equestria, ponies are preparing their own pageants for Hearth's Warming Eve in their own towns. It's tradition.
21100e So you're saying they'll be too busy to come to our play?
21100d Well, no. We're in the Canterlot pageant, the biggest, most important production in all of Equestria. A lot of ponies will come to watch us.
21100e A lot?
21100d Hundreds.
21100e Hundreds?
21100d [gasps] Maybe even thousands!
21100e [yelps]
211000 [wind rushing]
21100d Oh, my hair! Applejack? Be a dear and shut those windows, will you?
21100c Aaah! Rain-bow-Dash! Rain-bow-Dash! Aaaah! Thank you, thank you!
211008 It's a reenactment of the founding of Equestria. It's not the 'Rainbow Dash Show'.
21100c Well it should be the 'Rainbow Dash Show'! I'm the star!
211003 Fluttershy, you've got to come out of there!
211005 Curtain in two minutes!
211007 Twilight, let me handle this.
21100d My hair!
211003 PINKIE!
211007 [teeth chattering]
21100c [growls]
211008 The Hearth's Warming Eve pageant is about harmony and friendship.
211024 Shut the window!
211005 [sighs]
211000 [music]
211005 [with a faux British accent] Once upon a time, long before the peaceful rule of Celestia, and before ponies discovered our beautiful land of Equestria, ponies did not know harmony. It was a strange and dark time. A time when ponies were torn apart... by hatred!
211038 [gasp]
211005 [normal voice] I know. Can you believe it? [accent] During this frightful age, each of the three tribes – the Pegasi, the unicorns, and the Earth ponies – cared not for what befell the other tribes, but only for their own welfare. In those troubled times, as now, the Pegasi were the stewards of the weather. But they demanded something in return - food that could only be grown by the Earth ponies.
211038 [whispering]
211005 The unicorns demanded the same, in return for magically bringing forth day and night. And so, mistrust between the tribes festered until, one fateful day, it came to a boil. And what prompted the ponies to clash? 'Twas a mysterious blizzard that overtook the land and toppled the tribes' precarious peace.
211005 The normally industrious Earth ponies were unable to farm their land.
211000 [wind blowing]
211005 The Earth ponies were freezing. The home of the Pegasi fared no better. The Pegasi were hungry. And the unicorns were freezing and hungry. Even the unicorns' magic was powerless against the storm. Each tribe blamed the others for their suffering, and the angrier everypony grew, the worse the blizzard became. And so it was decided that a grand summit would be held to figure out a way to cope with the blizzard.
211000 [ponies chatting]
211005 Each tribe sent their leaders.
211000 [fanfare]
211005 Daughter of the unicorn king, Princess Platinum.
211000 [fanfare]
211005 Ruler of the Pegasi, Commander Hurricane. And lastly...
211000 [fanfare with kazoos]
211005 ...leader of the Earth ponies, Chancellor Puddinghead. Perhaps the three tribes could finally settle their differences and agree on a way to get through this disaster.
211130 [arguing]
21100c All I wanna know is why the Earth ponies are hogging all the food!
211131 [shouting]
211007 Us?! We're not hogging all the food, you are! Oh, wait, you're right. It's us. Well, it's only 'cause you mean old Pegasusususes are making it snow like crazy!
21100c For the hundredth time, it's not us! We're not making it snow! It must be the unicorns! They're doing it with their freaky magic!
21100d [gasps] How dare you! Unlike you Pegasi ruffians, we unicorns would never stoop to such a thing! H-m-ph!
211132 Hmph!
211007 Well, if you non-Earths aren't gonna stop using your weirdo powers to freeze us all, then I'm just plum out of ideas.
21100c What a shocker. An Earth pony with no ideas.
21100d Commander Hurricane, please cease with the insults!
21100c You're not the boss of me, your royal snootiness!
21100d I beg your pardon?! I am a princess! I won't be spoken to that way!
21100c Well, I'm leaving first!
211007 No, I'm first!
211130 [arguing]
211005 And the blizzard raged on.
211000 [windigos whinnying]
211005 So the summit of the tribes did not turn out as well as hoped, and the three leaders returned home to lick their wounds... and basically complain.
21100c Atten-tion! Well? Aren't you curious about how it went?
21100e Oh! Commander Hurricane, sir! How did it go, sir?
21100c Horribly! Those other tribe leaders are so disrespectful! Don't they realize that we are a mighty tribe of warriors, and should not be crossed? We have got to break ranks with those weak foals!
211000 [splat]
21100d [shivering] Clover the Clever! I need you!
211003 Yes, your Majesty. Did the other pony tribes see reason as I predicted?
21100d Those other tribes are impossible! I, for one, can no longer bear to be anywhere near those lowly creatures. The unicorns are noble and majestic. We will no longer consort with the likes of them!
211000 [splash]
211000 [thud]
211008 Wouldn't it have been easier to use the door, Chancellor?
211007 Maybe for you, Smart Cookie. But I am a chancellor. I was elected because I know how to think outside the box. Which means [slightly echoes] I can also think inside the chimney. Can you think inside a chimney?
211008 Uh...
211007 I didn't think so.
211008 Ugh.
211007 Ohmygosh. Hold on to your hooves! I am just about to be brilliant!
211008 [under her breath] That'd be a first.
211007 I have decided that the Earth ponies are gonna go it alone!
211008 Aw, so you mean the other tribes didn't come around? Shoot... I really thought we could get through to 'em if we–
211007 Don't worry about them. We're the ones with all the food, right?
211008 Actually, we're all out.
211007 Fine, then we'll have to go somewhere new where we can grow some new food. And with me as our fearless leader, what could go wrong?
211000 [crump]
211008 [under her breath] Where should I start?
211007 The point is...
211130 We must find a new land!
21100c C'mon, Private Pansy, let's get a move on! Hup-one, hup-two!
211000 [lightning cracks]
21100e [yelps]
21100c Get a hold of yourself, Private! We cannot let anything distract us from the mission at hand. To find, and if necessary, to conquer a new land!
21100e Conquer, sir?
21100c You never know where enemies might be lurking.
21100e I don't see any enemies, Commander. Just... snow.
21100c A-ha! What's that?! [fighting noises]
21100e [yelps]
21100c Okay. This is getting old.
21100d Oh, this is simply taking forever. My hooves are killing me! How long have we been walking for?
211003 About five minutes, your highness.
21100d Oh, I never imagined finding a new land would be so hard. But it'll all be worth it, don't you agree?
211003 I actually think that the three tribes could've tried harder.
21100d Stoooooop!
211003 What's wrong?
21100d That is what's wrong!
211000 [water rushing]
211003 Your Highness, it's just a stream. We can cross it easily.
21100d I refuse to get my gown wet. I have no intention of arriving at my new land looking like a bedraggled Earth pony, or worse yet a rough-and-tumble Pegasus. I, for one, have no intention of stooping down to their level. On the other hand, I have no trouble watching you stoop down.
211003 [groans]
21100d And do watch the gown, darling. It's worth more than all of the books in your library.
211007 Yes, yes. This is definitely the right direction.
211008 It feels like we're going in circles.
211007 But that's impossible. Are you suggesting that I'm reading the map wrong?
211008 Absolutely not, your chancellorness. It's just that there are holes in the map, and–
211007 Of course! How else could I see where I was going?
211008 Yeah, uh–
211007 Or talk? I need to be able to talk! I mean, how would we survive if I just suddenly shut up?
211008 Heaven forbid that should happen, your chancellorship. Heh. It's just that... the map is also upside down.
211007 I got a newsflash for you, Cookie. The Earth is round. There is no up or down.
211008 You're right! It's such a relief to me that you're in charge of this map...
211007 Relief? You don't need relief! If anypony needs relief around here, it's me! I'm a chancellor! I'm a bigshot! You're just my, um... my, uh...
211008 Secretary.
211007 Whatever. [spits] You take the map while I enjoy some relief.
211008 Yes, Chancellor Puddinghead.
211005 [accent] And so, each leader encountered obstacles along the way, but eventually, they all arrived in a new and wondrous land. Nopony had ever seen paradise before.
21100c This is the new land we've been searching for!
21100e What a view... I can see my future house from here.
21100c I proclaim this new land to be... Pegasopolis!
21100d I've never seen such jewels! This ruby is dazzling. This whole land is dazzling. I'm double dazzled! [squeals] In the name of the unicorns, I hereby dub this land Unicornia!
211007 The air! The trees! The dirt! This dirt is the dirtiest dirt in the whole dirt world!
211008 And fertile, too. Perfect for growing food.
211007 In the name of the Earth ponies, I think I'm gonna call this new place... uh... Dirtville!
211008 How about "Earth"?
211007 Earth! Congratulations to me for thinking of it.
211130 We found our new home!
21100c I planted my flag first!
21100d Did not!
21100c Did too!
211007 I planted mine earlier than first.
21100d All of you riffraff are trespassing in Unicornia!
21100c The name is Pegasopolis!
211007 Earth!
21100c Pegasopolis!
21100d Unicornia!
21100c I say we fight for the land. May the best pony win!
211000 [wind blows]
21100d That's barbaric. Clover the Clever, throw that brute into the dungeon!
211003 What dungeon? Look, perhaps if we all calmed down...
211008 I agree. Let's all calm down.
21100e I vote for calm.
21100c I'll have you court-martialed for insubordination, Private! We settle this on the battlefield!
211000 [whack]
21100d [laughs]
211000 [whack]
21100c [laughs]
21100d Who dares throw a snowball at royalty?!
211007 Wait a minute, where'd all this snow come from anyway?
21100c Oh no. Not again.
211000 [wind blowing]
211000 [windigos roaring]
211005 [accent] And so the paradise that the ponies had found was soon lost, buried beneath a thick blanket of snow and hard feelings. Instead of beautiful, it was blizzardy. Instead of wonderful, it was wintry! Instead of spectacular, it was snow-tacular! Instead of–
211023 We get it! Move on!
211005 [laughs nervously] [clears throat] [accent] Everypony was forced to seek shelter. They searched high and low, but the only shelter for miles was a cold and desolate cave. And, of course, the three tribes had to share it, and nopony was too happy about that.
21100d Please, Commander Hothead.
21100c It's Commander Hurricane.
21100d [clears throat] Please, Commander, could you just stand back and give me my royal space?
21100c You mean like this, your highness?
21100d Indeed not! You see this invisible line?
21100c Private, outline our territory for everypony to see. See this real, non-invisible line? No unicorns or Earth ponies are allowed to cross it! This is the sovereign territory of Pegasopolis!
21100d Clover the Clever?
211007 Uh... Smart Cookie!
211008 I know, I know.
21100c What are you doing? Don't go around the rock, go over it! I'm not giving up an inch of territory to the enemy!
21100d That rock is clearly on the Unicornia side of the cave, and it belongs to us! [under her breath] Who knows? There could be jewels inside.
21100c [grunts] I claim this rock for Pegasopolis!
21100d Unhand that rock this instant, you scoundrel!
211007 Oh, look, you found my rock. I've been looking for it everywhere.
21100c Hey! You invaded our territory!
211007 Finders keepers, losers weepers!
21100c That's the last straw!
21100d Give me my rock!
211130 [arguing]
211000 [wind blowing]
211003 Look, everypony! The entrance!
211000 [ice cracking]
21100c Great. Now there's no way out! We're trapped!
21100d You two deserve this horrible fate. You've done nothing but argue and fight with each other!
21100c You've been fighting too, your Highness.
211007 Yeah! Worse! I haven't been fighting nearly as much as you!
211000 [ice cracking]
21100d How ridiculous! A unicorn never stoops to fighting!
21100c That's just 'cause you wimpy unicorns know you'd never win! Earth ponies are numbskulls!
21100d Pegasi are brutes!
211007 Unicorns are snobs!
211133 [gasp] [sigh]
211000 [windigo roaring]
211133 [screams]
21100e W-W-What is that... thing?
211003 They must be... windigos!
211134 Windigos?
211003 My mentor Star Swirl the Bearded taught me about them. They're winter spirits that feed off fighting and hatred. The more hate the spirit feels, the colder things become!
211008 Then... this is our fault. We three tribes... we brought this blizzard to our home by fightin' and not trustin' each other. Now it's destroyin' this land, too.
211003 And now our bodies will become as cold as our hearts... all because we were foolish enough to hate.
21100e Well, I don't hate you... I actually hate Commander Hurricane a lot more than I hate you guys.
21101c [giggling]
211000 [windigo snorts]
21100e Actually, I don't really hate her, I just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really dislike her.
21101c [laughing]
211008 Well, I don't hate you guys either.
211003 Nor do I.
211000 [windigos whinnying]
211008 No matter what our differences, we're all ponies.
211000 [ice cracking]
211000 [ice shatters]
211000 [windigos whinnying]
21100e What was that?
211008 I didn't know unicorns could do that.
211003 I didn't either. Nothing like this has ever happened before. But I know it couldn't have been just me. It came from all three of us, joined together, in friendship.
211005 [accent] All through the night, the three ponies kept the fire of friendship alive by telling stories to one another and by singing songs, which of course became the winter carols that we all still sing today. Eventually, the warmth of the fire and singing and laughing reached the leaders, and their bodies began to thaw. [normal voice] And it even began to melt their hearts.
211000 [rumbling]
211005 [accent] The three leaders agreed to share the beautiful land, and live in harmony ever afterwards. And together, they named their new land...
211012 Equestria!
211038 [cheering]
211000 [Choir]
211000 The fire of friendship lives in our hearts
211000 As long as it burns, we cannot drift apart
211000 Though quarrels arise, their numbers are few
211000 Laughter and singing will see us through (will see us through)
211000 We are a circle of pony friends
211000 A circle of friends we'll be to the very end
211038 [cheering]
211003 We should be so honored that Princess Celestia chose us! She must really think we exemplify what good friends are!
211000 [wind blowing]
21100d Applejack, I thought you closed all the windows.
211008 Don't blame me. Rainbow Dash should've flown up there and shut it. After all, she's got wings.
21100c Why do I always have to do all the high up chores? Why can't Twilight use her magic for a change!
211012 [arguing]
211000 [windigo roars]
21100c Y'know what? I got it.

212000 [timberwolves howling]
212026 Eeyup.
212009 The zap apples are comin'! The zap apples are comin'!
212135 Yay, the zap apples are comin'!
212009 That's what I said.
212000 [theme song]
212009 Hey, silly goose! Quit your gawkin' and move your caboose!
212026 Eeyup.
212008 [grunts]
21200a Ready, Granny!
212009 Ready for what?
21200a For makin' zap apple jam!
212009 Darn tootin'! It's time for some good old-fashioned zap apple jammin'!
21200a Yes, ma'am. I can't wait, ma'am!
212009 [pause] Wait for what?
21200a To make zap apple jam with you!
212009 O'course. Now I been doin' this ever since I was a little pony, so be warned, pickle pear. There's a whole mess o' steps in this process and you gots to get each one of them just right, or no zap apple jam. Take this.
21200a Uh, is this one of your gazillion secret herbal ingredients for the zap apple jam?
212009 That there's a broom. Now get sweepin', pipsqueak! Now while you sweep, I'll get to, uh... something there... umm... oh, ponyfeathers. Bet I'd forget my mane if it wasn't attached to my head.
212000 [wind blowing]
212026 [sniffs]
212000 [electricity crackling]
212008 There's the zap apple leaves, right on schedule!
212009 A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L-M-N-O-P...
21205c [laughs]
212009 Well, howdy-doo there, Filthy Rich!
212136 Hello, Mrs Smith. Did I hear right that there's a zap apple harvest coming in a few days?
212009 Four days, to be exact.
212136 Excellent news, and as usual, I get your first hundred jars?
212009 'Course, Filthy.
212136 Uh, I prefer Rich.
212009 Oh, and how is your pappy doin'?
21205c Oh, you poor, poor thing, having to make all that zap apple jam with Granny Smith.
21200a Actually, I been looking forward to making zap apple jam for years!
21205c I'm not talking about the jam. I'm talking about Granny Smith! You must be sooo embarrassed.
212009 [muffled] Soup's on!
21200a Uh, what do ya mean?
21205c You know, with all her silly ways, how she forgets things, and makes you wear these ridiculous costumes?
21200a Granny said that the water needs—
21205c Thank goodness you're here on the farm and not in town where everypony could see you. [hushed] Don't worry. Your secret is safe with me.
21200a "Silly ways"?
212000 [gong crashing]
212009 Uh, thank you kindly, Filthy!
212009 Shake a leg there, slowpoke! We got a gaggle's worth of goods to gather before the harvest. Come on! [singing to the tune of "Skip to My Lou"] Gonna make zap apple jam, hoop-dee-hoo! Gatherin' my goodies now, hoop-dee-hee! Singin' and dancin', diddley-hoo, flippity-floo, my darlin! [voice cracks] They don't make 'em like they used to. [chomp]
212022 Hey! You bite it, you buy it!
212000 [bees buzzing]
212009 [muffled] Whoo! Why, hello, Bea, Beatrice, Beecher! Ooh, you've all been busy little bees, haven't you? [buzzes]
21200a Granny, isn't there a less... silly way to get the honey? [gasps]
212009 Oh, isn't this just precious?
21200a Please stop!
212009 And it is perfect for makin' our zap apple jam!
21200a Shh! Stop it, Granny!
212060 [laughing]
21200a Granny, please! Those ponies over there are watchin' me!
212009 What? Are those fillies your friends? Hello, Half-pint's friends!
21205f Hiii, Granny Smith! Hiii, Half-pint!
212060 [laughing]
212009 What dolls. Why, when I was little, ponies didn't come that purdy.
21200a Are we done shopping, Granny? 'Cause I'd like to get back to the farm, fast.
212009 All done, smellybelly. [singing] I got my honey, gooey-goo! Got my honey, gooey-ooh! Got my honey, iddley-hoo!
2120ed [snoring under]
212136 And, by capturing the wholesale market, purchasing in bulk, and slashing all prices, we undermined every other gift market in town. And that's how Rich's Barnyard Bargains became the cornerstone of retail in Ponyville.
21205c [clapping]
21205b Well, thank you, Mr Filthy— I mean, Mr Rich. What a wonderful day of sharing! And thank you for being a part of Family Appreciation Day! Now, uh, let's see who will be bringing in a family member for next Monday's Family Appreciation Day. Um... oh! Apple Bloom!
21200a But Miss Cheerilee. Monday is zap apple harvest day, and Applejack and Big McIntosh will be too busy to come and speak.
21205b Well, is there anypony else in your family that could—
21205c Miss Cheerilee. Apple Bloom's Granny Smith isn't working harvest. She could come.
21200a Oh! But, uh, no, that wouldn't—
21205b That's a splendid idea, Diamond Tiara! Apple Bloom, you shall bring in Granny Smith on Monday.
212000 [bell rings]
21205b Have a great weekend, everypony!
21200a Granny Smith? Come Monday, I'll be the laughin' stock of Ponyville!
212008 I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I already told you that we just can't take a break from harvest to come to your school. You know what'll happen.
21200a I know... after the fifth day, the zap apples disappear...
212000 [wind blows]
212000 [crows cawing]
212009 Look! The third sign! Right on time! Hot diggity!
212000 [electricity crackling and popping]
21200b Wow!
212009 Alright, you lazy daisies, move your caboose!
212008 I'm sorry, Apple Bloom, but don't you fret. Granny Smith's got no shortage of entertainin' stories to tell.
21200a I know. That's what I'm worried about.
21200a I'll be embarrassed, shamed, disgraced, mortified, humiliate—
212065 What are you, a dictionary?
212066 Snap out of it. We're here to help you!
212065 After all, we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders. We'll figure out a way to postpone your presentation.
21200a But how? Ugh! All this worry is makin' me sick!
212000 [stomach rumbles]
212066 Sick?
212065 That's it! C'mon!
212009 Ten-hut! Now listen here, troops! Now, I don't want any whinin' or cryin' or crackin' under pressure! Do I make myself clear?!
212000 [jar cracking]
212009 Court-martialed!
212000 [clang]
212065 Stay still, Apple Bloom! You have to look sick!
212000 [kettle boiling]
21200a Aaah! [muffled] Hey, this is hot!
212009 What in the hayseed is going on in there, silly billy?
212065 Oh, Granny Smith! We were just about to come get you!
212066 Apple Bloom's sick! Looks like she might have to stay home all week!
212009 [mumbles] Ooh! Perfect as a Piccadilly pear!
21200a Now what?
21200a It's already almost sundown! Tomorrow is Sunday, and I only have one more day to figure something out!
212066 Hey! Look!
21200a That's the fourth sign!
212000 [electricity crackling]
21200a The zap apples have appeared!
212066 And that gives me an idea!
212000 [bush rustling]
212066 We can't move Family Appreciation Day, so let's move harvest day instead!
21200a They don't look... quite ripe.
212065 Harvesting apples early never hurt an apple.
21200a I don't know... zap apple trees aren't like normal apple trees. They're magic.
212000 [electricity crackling]
212066 How different can they be?
212000 [thud]
212000 [electricity crackling]
21200a Well if we can't buck 'em, let's just pick 'em!
212080 [sounds of exertion]
212000 [splat]
21200a Any other bright ideas?
212000 [knocking]
21205b Granny Smith, it's Miss Cheerilee! Apple Bloom said you wanted to speak with me?... Hello? Granny Smi—
21200a [mimicking Granny Smith] Well hello there! Howdydoo!
21205b Hi... uh... Granny Smith... is, ugh, everything okay?
21200a [mimicking Granny Smith] Of course it is! Why wouldn't it be?
212009 [snores, continues under]
21200a [mimicking Granny Smith] Oh, er, excuse me. Uh, pickles always give me the hiccups! I need to tell you that I can't make the presentation on Monday after all!
21205b Oh no, is that so?
21200a [mimicking Granny Smith] No doubts about it! I gotta shear the flowers and water the sheep! I mean, I have to water the flowers and shear the sheep!
21205b Oh, well, that's too bad. We can reschedule.
212000 [thud]
212009 E— whut— hai— where am I? Well, howdy, Miss Cheerilee! You window shopping?
21205b Uh... no? You asked me to come here to tell me that you wouldn't be making it to Family Appreciation Day?
212009 Fiddlesticks! I wouldn't miss it for all the tea in Canterlot!
21205b But— didn't you just say...?
212009 See you Monday!
21200a [muffled] [sighs] I can't believe she woke up from her nap. [normal] She never wakes up from her nap! [muffled] I wish I could just run off and hide!
212066 Well, you can't run off... but maybe somepony else can!
212000 [wind blowing, lightning cracking]
212000 [electricity crackling]
212009 Yee-haw!
212008 The zap apple harvest has begun!
212000 [thud]
212009 And tomorrow we will be makin' up some zap apple jam!
212065 [in deeper voice] Miss Granny Smith? Telegram.
212009 Well, bust my buttons. Uncle Apple Strudel wants me to pay him a visit.
21200a And you can just make the 8AM train. I already packed you a bag!
212009 Well, that was considerate.
21200a [slaps]
212009 But don't you worry, flibbertigibbet! I'll be back in time to make that jam!
21200a [sighs] That train ride takes all day. I'm safe. Hah.
21205b For today's Family Appreciation Day, we are pleased to welcome Granny Smith. Um... Apple Bloom? Is Granny Smith here?
21200a Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Cheerilee, but she got called out of town on account of a family emergency—
212009 Well, howdy, my little ponies!
212009 Howdy, y'all! I'm as happy as a pig in a fresh mudpile to be here!
21200a Whuh— what are you doing here? Did you miss the train?
212009 Er, no, it came. And Uncle Apple Strudel was on it.
212137 Ooooooh, noogie-noogie-noggie! [laughs madly]
21205c I can't wait to hear Granny Smith's presentation. [hushed] If she can remember any of it.
212060 [giggling]
212009 Long ago, when I was a little pony, things were very different here in Ponyville, 'cause there was no Ponyville!
212009 [voiceover] That's right, my little ponies. Me and my family were pilgrim pony folk, back when I was a little filly. Oh, we ventured far and wide, collecting new seeds and sellin' the old. But my pa was the finest seed collector in all of Equestria. Then, one day, the Smith family found themselves in the most brilliant, most grand, most magnificent of all cities. A place called... Canterlot. Well, I bet your hooves to hindquarters I had never seen anything like it before nor since. And as if the beauty of that city wasn't enough, suddenly, she appeared. Princess Celestia, the most regal of all ponies. When lo and behold, she stopped to look at my pa's seed collection. Then Princess Celestia saw that we were plumb-tuckered and hankerin' to find our forever home. And bein' a royal Princess and all, she knew exactly the place for us to lay down our stakes. My pa gave the Princess a mighty thanks. We quickly found that land near the Everfree Forest, and we built our first home. Next, we planted our first orchards. But an orchard don't grow overnight, and we were getting mighty short on food. Now mind you, we were cautioned about the forest, and we knew that it was not fit to enter.
212000 [timberwolf howling]
212009 [voiceover] But I knew there was critters livin' there. There must be somethin' to eat. It was dark and musty, and I won't lie, it was scary. But every inch was covered in plant life, and before I knew it, wasn't I standin' in front of the most incredible apple trees! I had never seen anything that bore this kind of colorful fruit! Oh I started picking apples quick as a whip!
212000 [timberwolves howling and growling]
212009 [voiceover] I turned, and there before me stood the timberwolves! I've never run so fast in my life. I did the only thing I could think of.
212000 [pot banging]
212009 [voiceover] My pa and I planted those special apple seeds, and before our eyes they grew like wildfire. Why, we had full grown trees faster than you could say 'lickety split'. Then each year, I paid close attention to the signs of the zap apples' special harvesting times—how the weather affects the Everfree Forest, how the timberwolves howl when the zap apples first start growing, and how they zapped away if you didn't pick 'em all in one day! And the fruits of our labor were the best fruit we ever tasted. Soon enough I was mixing up batches of zap apple jam. Just like harvestin' the zap apples had its special rules, so did makin' zap apple jam. I learned that you gotta be extra friendly with the bees, otherwise their honey won't taste rightly sweet to mix in with the zap apples. Who'd'a thought that glass jars needed talkin' to? Or that zap apples like pink polka dots? But magic is as magic does. Just funny that way. Then ponies started comin' to our farm from far and wide just to get a taste of my zap apple jam. Some of them decided to stay, like Stinkin' Rich, Diamond Tiara's great grandfather. Matter of fact, the first thing he ever sold was my zap apple jam.
212000 [train whistle blowing]
212009 [voiceover] And before we knew it, we had ourselves a nice little town, bustling with all kinds of ponies. And that is how Ponyville was founded.
21205f [clapping]
2120f3 [clapping]
212009 Oh, thank you kindly, little ponies. Oh, now now, let's settle down.
212065 So if it weren't for you and the zap apples, Ponyville wouldn't even exist?!
212009 Darn tootin', little filly!
21200a If it weren't for my Granny Smith, your daddy wouldn't have Barnyard Bargains.
212138 ["It's true", general agreement]
21205c But—
212009 [licks]
21205c But she's just a... kooky old lady!
2120f3 [gasp]
21200a She is not a kooky old lady! She is the most amazing pony in all of Ponyville!
212065 I think this is the best zap apple jam I've tasted yet!
212066 Must be 'cause you had something to do with it, Apple Bloom.
212009 You betcha. Apple Bloom is one humdinger of a zap apple jammer!
21200a I am?
212008 So I take it Family Appreciation Day went well?
21200a Did it? My Granny Smith is super special! I just forgot that for a little while.
212009 Aw, don't fret. I forget things all the time. Now, I'll getcha... er... somethin'. Aw.
212008 Who wants to help Granny sing to the water?
2120f3 We do, we do!
212139 A, B, C, D, E, F, G... [continues]
212136 Diamond Tiara?
21205c But dad!

213012 [chattering excitedly]
213008 Can you believe the new baby is finally here?
213003 Cup Cake and Carrot Cake must be so proud!
21300d I wonder if it's a filly or a colt?
213007 I wanna see the new baby pony! I wanna see! Which one is it?!
21302b Meet our son, Pound Cake.
21313a [yawns]
213012 Awwww.
21302b ...and our daughter, Pumpkin Cake.
21313b [yawns]
213012 Huh?
213007 Two new foals for me to play with? [gasps] That's two, two, two times the fun! This is the greatest day ever! We need to celebrate your birthday, babies, 'cause you were just born today! Woo-hoo!
21302c Shhh. The babies are trying to sleep.
213007 But I was just–
21302c Shhh.
213007 But–
21302c Shhh!
213007 [quieter] Happy happy birthday to you and you today–
213000 [thud]
213008 Now how in thunderation is one of them twins a Pegasus and the other one a unicorn?
21302b Easy. My great-great-great-great-grandfather was a unicorn, and Cup Cake's great-aunt's second cousin twice removed was a Pegasus. That makes sense, right?
21300c Aw, yeah! Heh, just you wait! Once little Pound Cake there gets his wings going, he'll be all over the place.
213003 And be careful around Pumpkin Cake.
21300d Baby unicorns get strange magic surges that come and go.
213007 Quick! Make a wish and blow out your candles! Which is easy, 'cause there are zero candles! You are zero years old, after all!
21302c Shhh!
213000 [theme song]
21313c [happy gurgling]
213007 [Pinkie Pie]
213007 Happy month-i-versary to you and you today!
213000 [very quickly] I-can't-believe-you're-already-a-month-old. Time-sure-flies-doesn't-it-wow. Seems-like-only yesterday-you-were-born.
213000 But now you're a month old today, hey!
21313c [blowing party kazoos] [excited giggling]
213007 Are you ready for your favoritest game in the whole wide world? Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Here I am!
21313c [laughing]
213007 Here I am! Here I am! Here I am! [blows raspberry]
21302a Everything okay in there? Who needs a diaper change?
213007 Don't worry, they're fine! [sniffs] Oogh, I mean...
21302b Oh, I got it.
213000 [clang]
21313c [giggling]
21302b Is anypony hungry?
213007 Ah, no thanks. I just had a big breakfast.
21302a I'm on it.
21313c [sucking]
213000 [watch ticking]
21313c [sighs] [groans]
213007 Oh, oh, you're making funny faces! I have one! Bleghhh!
21302b [chuckles] No, y'see, Pinkie, the babies need to be burped.
21313c [belches]
213007 All set now? Everything good? Okay, who wants to play again?
21313c [excited giggling]
21302a Uh uh uh, Pound Cake, no pounding things.
21302b Uh uh uh uh, we don't chew on things, Pumpkin Cake.
213007 Except food.
21302a [gasps] Food! Great cinnamon sticks, I completely forgot.
213007 No, you just fed them bottles, remember?
21302a Not the babies' food!
21302b Gh! The food for the enormously big catering order we have to deliver today!
21302a Oh, with the new twins, we've been so distracted!
21302b Gh, quick, honeybun, we need to find a babysitter to watch the foals while we take care of this.
213007 I could do it! I wanna do it! Oh, the babies love playing with me, I'll do it!
21302a I wonder who would be available on such short notice.
213007 Me! Me! Pick me!
21300e Oh, I would love to babysit! But I can't today, sorry. I promised Angel we'd go on a picnic. You understand, don't you? Y-you're not mad at me, are you? Please don't be mad at me!
213007 I'll do it! Pick me!
213003 I have to finish this report for the Princess summarizing all my other reports to the Princess.
213007 I wanna babysit! Pick me!
213000 [thwack!]
213000 [apples thudding]
213008 Babysit? Now? When there's a swarm o' hungry caterpillars headin' this way? I gotta get all these apples picked before they get swarmed on!
213007 Ooh, ooh, I wanna do it!
21300c I got tickets to the Wonderbolts airshow this afternoon. Gotta dash!
213007 Ask me! Mememememememememememememe!
21300d Moi? Babysit? N- Oh nonononononononono! I'm flattered that you would think about me though.
21302b [groans] [unenthusiastically] Pinkie Pie, how would you like to babysit for us?
213007 [gasps] I dunno. I'll have to check my schedule.
213000 [doors bang]
21313b [giggles]
21302b Now, Pinkie, are you sure you really understand the responsibility of watching over two babies?
213007 I can be responsible. Why, responsibility is my middle name. Pinkie Responsibility Pie.
21302a But this time you need to take care of them, not just play with them. You have to be responsible.
213007 Yes, I know. I will. I am.
213000 [ding]
21302a Oh, here you are, dearie. All your responsibilities are on this list.
213007 Whoa! That's a lot of responsi– Consider it done.
21302b [to Mrs Cake] We'll frost it when we get there! C'mon, sugarplum, tick-tick!
21302a Take good care of our two precious little ginger snaps!
213007 No problemo, Mr and Mrs Cake. Everything is under control.
21313c [crying]
213007 Uh-oh.
21313c [crying]
213007 Oh, don't cry, little friends! Look, look! Where's Pinkie Pie...? Where's Pinkie Pie?
21313c [crying]
213007 Oh no... I'm right here, see?
21313c [crying]
213007 [warbling noises]
21313c [crying]
213007 Oh, think think think... Aha!
213007 Hey guys, watch this!
213000 [applause]
213007 Hey, you're a wonderful crowd here tonight! Where y'all from? Wow, that's great. Y'know, I used to have an ant farm, but I had to get rid of it because... I couldn't find tractors that small!
213000 [ba-dum tish]
213007 Get it? Tractors that small? [pause] The other day, I spilled spot remover on my dog... and now I can't find him!
213000 [ba-dum tish]
21313c [crying]
213007 Gee, tough crowd. [to herself] Tell me about it. Fine, I wasn't gonna pull off a show stopper, but you're a lovely audience and I think you deserve it!
213007 First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
213007 First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
21313c [crying]
213007 [Pinkie Pie]
213007 First you jiggle your tail! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then you wriggle your snout! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then you wiggle your rump! Oink oink oink!
213007 Then shout it out! Oink oink oink!
213000 [ploof]
21313c [giggling]
213007 There, see? Nothing to this babysitting business! Ugh!
213007 Snack time. That's easy enough. Okie-dokie! Eat up! Like this! Num-num-num, num-num-num-num! Ahh!
21313b Nom-
213007 No, Pumpkin Cake, we eat food, not tablecloths.
21313b [crying]
213000 [splat]
21313c [crying]
213007 Huh, huh? Uh, hey, guys, look at me!
213000 [ploof]
213007 Achoo!
21313c [giggling]
213007 Yeah. I think I can see where this is going. [snorts]
213000 [water running]
21313c [giggling]
213007 Towels are not food, Pumpkin Cake!
21313c [giggling]
213007 Drop it... Drop it... Drop it!?
21313c [muffled giggling] [giggling] [crying]
213007 Ooh, look, guys! Bubbles! [blows]
213000 [bubble pops]
21313c [crying]
213007 Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't cry! Look, look, uh, floating things! Ooh, aaah, eeh!
21313c [crying]
213000 [water spraying]
213000 [crunch]
213007 Uh, don't make me do it, guys! You know what happens when you mix flour and water, don't you?
21313c [crying]
213000 [ploof]
213000 [splatting sounds]
21313c [giggling]
213007 [sniffs] [gasps] [holding nose] Smells like somepony needs me to changy-wangy their diaper-wiper right now-a-wow! [normal] Easy... easy...
21313c [giggling]
213007 [sighs]
21313b [giggles]
213007 [growls]
213000 [fight sounds; Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake giggling throughout]
213007 Wait- no- stay there- just- for a second- stand still, I've almost-
21313c [giggling]
213007 Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
213000 [bell rings]
213007 Oh! Thank goodness they're home!
213003 Hi! I finished up the work I had to do, so I thought I'd stop by and see if you needed any help. Whoa!
213007 Thank you, thank you, thank you for coming! I can't begin to tell you what my day has been like! I mean, these babies just won't listen to reason, and don't even get me started on their taste in stand-up comedy.
213000 [ba-dum tish]
213003 It's okay, Pinkie. I figured you would need some help. That's why I stopped by.
213007 Ex-cuse me?
213003 Babies take a lot of work, and some ponies are just not cut out to handle the responsibility.
213007 Is that so? Well, thanks for stopping by, Twilight. Sorry, I don't have time to visit. I'm very very busy with my responsibilities here.
213003 I'm happy to help! It's no trouble–
213000 [door slams]
213007 Well, of all the– She thinks I can't handle things on my own! Maybe because I haven't handled things on my own. Well, I can handle things on my own!
21313a [happy burbling]
213000 [toy squeaking]
21313b [giggling and numing]
213007 Pound Cake. [growls] This is a crib. It is only to be used for napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey Western fort. It is not a trampoline, so stop your jumping right now, mister!
21313b [giggling]
213007 And you, young filly. We do not put anything in our mouth that we cannot safely and properly digest, so stop slobbering on that toy this instant!
213000 [toy squeaks]
213007 Now, we've all had a very exhausting afternoon, and it's time for all good little foals to take their nap. So, fall asleep!
21313c [snoring]
213007 [sighs] [kisses twice] Sleep tight.
213000 [toy squeaks]
213007 Now that's what I call handling things. [gasps]
213007 Oh, nononono. Not good, not good, not good! Pound? Pumpkin? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are!
213000 [toy squeaks]
21313b [squeaks toy]
213007 Whoa! You be a good little girl now, Pumpkin-wumpkin, and stay in your crib for your pal Pinkie-winkie!
21313b [squeaks toy repeatedly]
213007 Pound Cake? [clicks] Here, Pound Cake!
213000 [wind blowing]
21313a [echoed giggles]
213007 Uh, Pound Cake? Uh...
21313b [squeaks toy]
21313a [echoed giggles]
21313b [squeaks toy; sound gets lower and more sinister]
213000 [Psycho chords play]
21313a [giggles]
213007 [squeals] You can fly?!
21313a [giggles]
213007 Oh... get down here... this instant... young... colt! [gasps for breath] I'm responsible for you!
213000 [suction cup noises]
21313b [giggles] Nom nom nom.
213007 No no no, Pumpkin.
21313b Nom nom.
213007 No no.
21313b Nom.
213007 No. Hmph! I am the responsible one, and I said no.
21313a Wheeee!
213007 That goes for you too, Pound Cake!
213000 [thud]
213007 Gotcha! I think? [yelping]
213000 [thudding on stairs]
213000 [splats]
213007 Mm, razzleberry. I'm- not- letting- go! I'm- re-spon-si-ble!
213000 [thudding on stairs]
213000 [elastic stretching]
21313c [giggling]
213007 Oh, not you too! There! Now who's the responsible one?
21313b [jubilant giggling]
213007 [yelps] [sobbing]
213000 [ploof]
213007 [giggles] Y'know, you're right. That is funny.
21313a [snoring]
21313b [sleepy mumbling]
213007 Dear Princess Celestia,
213007 I've always had fun playing with little kids, and I thought babysitting meant just more playtime, right? Wrong! Being a caregiver is way more responsibility than just being a playmate. And today, I learned that sometimes our desire for responsibility can outrun our actual ability to handle it.
213000 [bell rings]
21302b Pinkie Pie! We're back!
21302a How did everything go? [gasps]
21302b Are we in the right place?
213007 Shhh!
21313a [snoring]
21313b [sleepy mumbling]
21302a P-Pinkie. This is just... just...
21302b Amazing is what it is. We had no idea how responsible you really are. Would you be interested in becoming our go-to babysitter on a permanent basis?
213007 [gasps] Hm- Ah- lemme check my schedule! I should be available a week from... never!
21313c [sighs]
21313a Pinkie...
21313b Pie...
213007 [happily gasps] I have some free time next Tuesday.
213000 [music]
213000 [credits]
214000 [galloping]
214000 [tap on wood]
21400a Whoo-- Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Applejack, you're sure to knock everypony's hat off at the Equestria Rodeo competition!
214008 Aw shucks, Apple Bloom. I sure hope so.
21400a Hope so? I know so! After all, you're the ten-time rodeo champeen of Ponyville! Why, you've got more blue ribbons than anypony in Ponyville ever! And I can't wait for my big sis to win every blue ribbon in Equestria and bring home the title of Equestria Rodeo champeen!
214000 [theme song]
21400c Huh? Now, careful, Derpy! Don't want to do any more damage than you've already done.
214000 [crash]
21413d I just don't know what went wrong.
214000 [lightning zaps]
21400c Yeah. It's a mystery.
21413d Nice work, Rainbow Dash.
214000 [thud]
214000 [wood splintering]
21400c [yelps]
21413d You okay, Rainbow Dash? Anything I can do to help?
21400c No! Nothing! In the name of Celestia, just sit there and do nothing!
214000 [wood splintering]
214000 [crash]
21413d Oops. My bad.
2140ec Applejack! Applejack! Applejack! Applejack! [continues chanting]
214010 Everypony, can I get your attention? Attention please!
2140ec [stops chanting]
214010 Yes, we are all here to send Applejack to compete in this year's Equestria Rodeo competition in Canterlot.
2140ec [cheering and applause]
214010 And I want to thank Applejack in advance for generously offering up her prize money to fix town hall.
21413d Yeah, Applejack! Whoo-hoo!
214000 [thud]
2140ec [cheering and stomping]
214007 Speech! Speech!
214008 Oh, shucks. I'm not much for speeches.
214007 Alright then, no speech!
214008 Buuut! This here is the nicest send off anypony could ask for. Y'all have been cheering me on in every rodeo since I was a little little pony. So it seems only fittin' to use my winnings to fix up town hall. I promise to make Ponyville proud.
2140ec [cheering]
214000 [bell ringing]
214009 I want you to show all them highfalutin rodeo ponies what a real rodeo pony's like!
214008 You betcha, Granny Smith.
214010 And bring back all that money!
214008 You betcha, Mayor.
214007 And have fun. And don't be nervous. Or if you are, use that nervous energy to do even better than you already would! And eat peanuts and popcorn and taffy. Taffy gives lots of nervous energy! [munching]
214003 Just do your best, Applejack.
214008 I'll do better than my best!
21413e The train to Canterlot is about to leave! All aboard who's coming aboard!
214008 Guess that means me.
21400c Seeya in a week!
21400a With lots of new blue ribbons!
214010 And lots of money!
214008 Darn tootin'! See y'all in a week, with a big bag full of blue ribbons!
21413f [Bye, etc.]
214007 And drink sarsaparilla! What? It gives you extra sass.
21400e Oh, I hope Applejack is surprised by this surprise party!
21400c Well, that is the point.
21400e I know, but I hope she isn't so surprised she's startled, because while being surprised can be nice, being startled can be... very startling.
214007 Surprise!
214000 [party whistle blows]
214000 [thud]
21400e [gasps] Oh, Pinkie, you startled me.
214007 Sorry! I was just practicing my "surprise!" for when we surprise Applejack with this super cool party for becoming rodeo champeen of Equestria! Surprise!
214000 [party whistle blows]
214000 [thud]
214003 Quiet, Pinkie, I think Applejack's coming!
214007 Don't worry, Twilight. Got my lips all limbered up! [various mouth noises]
214000 [door opens]
21400f Surprise!
214026 [blows kazoo]
214007 Surprise! Shoot!
214140 Wow, this is the best surprise ever! How did you know it was my birthday?
214000 [doors slam twice]
21400a Who's it from, Twilight? What's it say?
214003 It's from Applejack. "Family and friends, not coming back to Ponyville."
21400f [gasp]
214003 "...Don't worry, will send money soon." That's all there is.
21400f [gasp]
21400a Applejack's... not comin' back?
21400c What do you mean Applejack's not coming back?! She loves Ponyville!
214009 And she loves Sweet Apple Acres!
21400a And she loves her family!
21400d [gasps] Something just dreadful must have happened to Applejack to make her not return!
21400e Maybe she's hurt, or sad, or scared!
21400c So, what are we waiting for? Let's go find her!
214003 Don't worry. We'll search all of Equestria if we have to. We'll bring her back.
21400a Y'all are the best.
214009 Thank you, girls! [to Big McIntosh] Our little bushel just lost one apple.
214026 [sniffles]
214000 [train whistle blows]
214000 [ball deflates]
214000 [hawk cries]
214007 [panicked sounds under]
21400c I hope this lead doesn't turn out to be a dead end. I don't wanna go home empty-hooved after promising we'd find her.
21400e I don't know how we'll break it to the Apple family.
214003 I don't know how we'll break it to Ponyville!
214007 I don't know how I'll make it to the next stop!
214003 This is Dodge Junction, girls. Applejack is supposed to have come here after the rodeo ended. Let's fan out and try to find her.
214007 Ooh, pickles! [knocking] Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurry! Hurry it up in there!
214000 [toilet flushes]
214008 Huh, some ponies. Sheesh.
214007 Applejack! I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her!
21400d Oh, Applejack, thank heavens!
21400e We're so glad you're safe!
214007 I found her, I found her, I found her, I found her! Be right back.
214000 [door shuts]
214008 Uh, hey, everypony. What's up?
21400c Why didn't you come back to Ponyville?!
21400d Yes, why are you here?
214000 [toilet flushes]
21400e Are you okay?
214007 Do you have any snacks?
214003 Tell us what happened, Applejack!
214141 Applejack? Are these some of your Ponyville friends?
214003 Yes, ma'am.
21400d And you are?
214141 Why, I'm Cherry Jubilee, boss of Cherry Hill Ranch. Hasn't Applejack told ya? I saw her compete at the Equestria Rodeo. Never saw anypony win so many ribbons in all my life.
214008 Aw shucks, Miss Jubilee. You don't have to go into all that.
214141 Oh, she's so modest. Anyway, I can always use a pony with quick hooves and a strong back. So, when I heard Applejack was looking for a change of scenery, I snapped her up as quick as I could and brought her to Dodge Junction. Well, I'll let you catch up with your friends. See you back at the ranch.
21400c "Change of scenery"? What's that supposed to mean?
214008 S'no big deal, guys. I thought cherries would be a nice change from apples, so I took the job and came here. That's it. End of story.
214007 That's it? Well, that's a terrible story!
214008 Sorry, but that's all there is to tell. Thanks for checkin' on me, but y'all can go home now. Tell my family hi, and that I'm doing a-okay.
21400c Excuse me, AJ, but we didn't travel all over Equestria searching for you to come home without you!
214008 Well, I didn't ask you to come lookin' for me! There is nothin' to tell and I am not going back to Ponyville!
214003 I don't care what she says. Applejack's not telling us something.
21400c Twilight's right. We gotta get her to spill the beans.
214007 What?! She had beans? Ugh, I told her I was snacky!
214141 You ready to put your back into it, Applejack?
214008 Sure am, Miss Jubilee.
214141 Terr-ific. Come on in, girls!
214008 What are you all doing here?
214003 We're your cherry sorters. Shall we get started?
214008 Fine.
214141 Haha, red cherries go in one bin, and yellow cherries go in the other. Simple as cherry pie. Uh, just one teensy thing to remember – have fun!
214008 What are you five up to?
21400d Well, uh, you made working on a cherry orchard sound... so delightful.
214008 Uh-huh. Well, just remember - no talking about Ponyville.
21400c Fine! Why don't you quit talking and get walking?
214003 So, AJ, how was Canterlot? Not talking about Ponyville, talking about Canterlot, totally different town.
214008 Canterlot was fine.
214003 Was the rodeo fun?
214008 Yes.
214003 Did you meet some nice ponies there?
214008 Some.
21400c Really? Did you see Wild Bull Hickok? What about Calamity Mane?
214008 Yes, I saw 'em both.
21400d And how did you meet Miss Jubilee?
214008 Um, well, Miss Jubilee had a cherry stand at the rodeo. Real good treats.
21400e Um, excuse me?
214008 Cherry winks, cherry cheesecake, cherry tarts. We struck up a conversation, being orchard folk and all.
214003 So you told her about Sweet Apple Acres?
214008 Yes.
21400c Did you tell her why you weren't going back?
214008 No, 'cuz it was none of her business!
21400e Ooh... Can you please slow down?
21400c Is it because I made it rain on you that one time?
214008 No!
21400e Help!
214003 Is it because you were insulted when I gave you that book on organized orchards?
214008 NO!
21400d Is it because you were insulted when I insulted your hair?
214008 No, no, NO! I'm not telling you why, so just–
21400e STOP!
214000 [screech]
214000 [splat]
214015 [gasp]
214003 Well, girls, we seem to be striking out.
21400c That's 'cause we're playing too nice.
21400d Yes. Desperate times do call for desperate measures.
21400c It's time to call in the big guns.
214007 Hey, Applejack. Need some help?
214008 You promise not to ask me any questions?
214007 I promise. Have you ever had a cherrychanga? Ooh! Sorry, that was a question.
214008 That kind of question is fine, Pinkie. No, I-I never had a cherrychanga.
214007 Well, no wonder, because I made it up myself! A cherrychanga is mashed up cherries in a tortilla that's deep fried. Cherrychanga. Great name, huh? Oh, but maybe I should call it a chimicherry. Ooh, that's good too. Which do you think sounds better? Cherrychanga or chimicherry? Or what if I combine them? Chimicherrychanga! What sounds the funniest? I like funny words! One of my favorite funny words is 'kumquat'! I didn't make that one up. I would work in a kumquat orchard just so I could say 'kumquat' all day! Kumquat, kumquat, kumquat! And 'pickle barrel'! Isn't that just the funnest thing to say? Pickle barrel, pickle barrel, pickle barrel! Say it with me! Pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, pickle barrel, kumquat, chimicherrychanga!
214008 No! Make it stop, make it stop!
214007 [continues chant, muffled by Rainbow Dash]
21400c The only way to make it stop is for you to spill the beans!
214008 Never!
214007 Speaking of beans, did you ever realize how many words rhyme with 'beans'? Lean, mean, spleen, unclean, bean... [continues under]
214008 Alright, alright! I'll tell everypony what's goin' on! Just please stop talkin'! But... can it wait 'til tomorrow at breakfast? I'm plum tuckered out.
21400c Tomorrow, huh? I don't know...
214007 Do you Pinkie promise?
214008 [sighs] I will tell you the whole truth at breakfast. Pinkie promise.
214000 [rooster crows]
214003 I'm glad we're finally gonna get some answers from Applejack.
21400c Yeah, maybe.
214007 Don't worry, Rainbow. She's gotta 'fess up after making a Pinkie promise.
214000 [knocking]
214007 Good morning, Applejack. You ready for br– [gasps] Nopony breaks a Pinkie promise!
214007 Applejack! [slightly distorted] You Pinkie promised!
214008 [yelps]
214007 Applejack, come back here!
214008 Giddy up, fellas, I gotta get the heck out of Dodge!
214142 [neighs]
214007 She's gonna get away!
214003 Oh no, she won't! Look, girls!
214007 Follow that stagecoach! Oh, we have you now!
214000 [screeching]
214143 [sniffs]
214008 Whoa! What the hay?
21400c Pull over!
214008 Hey! Cut that out! Whoa! [to coach ponies] I'll pay you double to outrun them.
214003 We'll pay you triple to slow down!
214008 I'll pay you quadruple to leave them in the dust!
214000 [horses neighing]
214024 [coughing]
21400d That was rude!
214007 Get them! Get them!
21400c Come on, Fluttershy!
214008 Hyah! C'mon, y'all! Go, go!
214007 Applejack, you broke your Pinkie promise! Apologize!
214008 Pinkie, I did not break my promise!
214007 Wha?
214008 If y'all reckon back, I told you that I would tell you everything at breakfast. But I didn't come for breakfast. I couldn't come to that breakfast, not if it meant telling y'all what happened.
214007 Well, I... I...
214008 I'm sorry, Pinkie, but I can't tell y'all the truth. I just can't!
214007 Well I heard a "sorry" in there, so that'll have to do for now. I'll get a real apology later. Rarity, catch me.
21400d What? Pinkie– [screams]
214000 [crunch]
214003 Rainbow, go back!
21400c No time! They knew what they were getting into!
21400d [coughs]
214000 [railway crossing bells]
214008 Yes. Hyah!
214000 [train whistle]
214000 [crunches]
214008 Yee-haw!
214142 [in unison] Lady, you're trouble.
214008 Ha, try and catch me now. Oh, nuts.
21400e [panting]
21400c Not so fast!
214000 [thump]
214008 Fine. Now you know.
214003 Know what?
214008 Well, just look!
214003 I am. You won an amazing number of ribbons, just like Miss Jubilee said!
214008 Don't you get it? There's every color of ribbon down there. Every color... but... blue. I came in fourth, third, even second, but I didn't win one first prize, and I certainly didn't win any prize money.
21400c But the telegram said you were gonna send money.
214008 That's why I came here. I wanted to earn some money. After that big old send off Ponyville gave me, I just didn't have the nerve to come home empty-hooved. I couldn't come home a failure.
214003 Applejack, you're not a failure.
21400c And we're your friends! We don't care if you came in fiftieth place! You're still number one in our books.
214008 So... you're not upset or disappointed?
214144 Nn-nn.
214008 But what about the mayor? I don't think I can face her and tell her I didn't get that money to fix the broken roof.
21400e Applejack, we can always find a way to fix that hole in the roof. But if you don't come back, we'll never be able to fix the hole in our hearts.
21400c [sniffles] Darn it! Now you got me acting all sappy!
214008 Dear Princess Celestia,
214008 It's a tad easier to be proud when you come in first than it is when you finish further back. But there's no reason to hide when you don't do as well as you'd hoped. You can't run away from your problems. Better to run to your friends and family.
214007 What do you think, Rarity? Chimicherry or cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? Chimicherry, cherrychanga? [continues under]
21400d When I get back, you're gonna get it, Rainbow Dash! [grumbles]
214007 [continues repeating question to fadeout]

214000 [credits]
215000 [knocking]
21500e [yawns] Who could that be? It's still dark.
215000 [crash]
21500c C'mon, Fluttershy! Cider season's about to start!
21500e [squee] [shrieks] Oh, where are we? What's the rush?
21500c The rush? Don't you remember what happened last year? Or the year before that? Or pretty much any cider season ever?
21500e Um, well, uh—
21500c Pinkie Pie. She always ends up ahead of us in line, and then they always run out of cider!
21500e I guess I—
21500c Well, not this year! This year I'm gonna get there before sunrise, so I can drink all the cider I want and laugh when she doesn't get any! It's the perfect plan. Y'know, I might even buy some cider and hold onto it for a while, drinking it drop by drop in front of her— [gasps]
21500e Gee, Rainbow Dash. It looks like a few other ponies had the same idea.
215000 [zipping noise]
21500e Oh, gosh, Pinkie. I love your new style.
21500c Who are all these ponies?!
215007 Isn't this great? I couldn't sleep last night 'cause I was so excited about cider season, and I had this brilliant idea to come down here and camp out, so I told a few others about it, and they all thought it was a great idea too, and now it's just a big old cider party! Woo-hoo! Oh, gosh, that's a lot of ponies. Hope they don't run out before you get any.
21500c [growls]
215000 [theme song]
215003 Isn't this exciting, Spike? Opening day of cider season!
215005 Yeah! That means it's only thirty more days 'til sapphire season!
215008 [through megaphone] Attention, everypony! Cider season is now officially open!
21500f [excited chattering]
215000 [bits clinking]
215000 [tap pressing repeatedly]
21500c [growls]
215000 [tap fizzling]
215008 Heh. Sorry, everypony! That's it for today!
21500f Awww.
21500c Surprise, surprise. You ran out again!
215059 Yeah, you always run out!
21500e For the record, I don't mind—
21500c Why can't you make enough cider for all of us? Or at least for me!
21500f ["Yeah", general complaining]
215008 Hold on, everypony. We've done our best to improve supply this year-
215059 You always say that!
215008 And it's always true. But Apple family cider is made with love and integrity, and only the highest quality apples in Equestria. Sorry, but that recipe takes time.
21500f [more complaining]
215008 If y'all just be patient, we'll have plenty more tomorrow.
215007 She's right, y'know! You can't rush perfection! And this year's batch was perfection!
21500e Uh, Pinkie Pie—
215007 I'll never forget the cider I just drank! It was a moment in time that will never exist again. [sighs]
21500c [growls]
215000 [honk]
215000 [motorized noises]
215008 What in Equestria is that?
215000 [bang]
215146 [Flim]
215146 Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine, it's the same in every town
215146 Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be found
215146 Maybe they're not aware that there's really no need for this teary despair
215145 [Flam]
215145 That the key that they need to solve this sad cider shortage you and I will share
21500f [excited chattering]

215146 No pony else in this whole place will give you such a chance to be where you need to be
215146 And that's a new world, with tons of cider
215146 Fresh squeezed and ready for drinking
215145 [Flam]
215145 More cider than you could drink in all your days of thinking
21500c I doubt that.

215146 [Flim]
215146 And I suppose by now you're wondering, where is this promised cider?
215145 [Flam]

2150ec Cider, cider, cider, cider... [continues until Granny Smith interrupts]
215146 Watch closely, my friends!
215145 [Flam]
215145 The fun begins!
215146 Now, here's where the magic happens. Right here in this heaving, roiling, cider-press-boiling guts of the very machine, those apples plucked fresh are right now as we speak being turned into grade-A, top-notch, five-star, blow-your-horseshoes-off, one-of-a-kind cider!
215145 [Flam]
215145 Feel free to take a sneak peek!
215009 [Granny Smith]
215009 Now wait, you fellers, hold it!
215009 You went and over-sold it!
215009 I guarantee that what you have there won't compare
215009 For the very most important ingredient
215009 Can't be added or done expedient
215009 And it's quality, friends, Apple Acres' quality and care!
215146 [Flim]
215146 Well, Granny, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up
215146 You see that we are very picky when it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup
215145 [Flam]
215145 Yes, sir, yes, ma'am, this great machine lets just the very best
215145 So whaddaya say then, Apples?
215145 Care to step into the modern world
215145 And put the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to the test?
2150ec [Crowd]
2150ec Cider, cider, cider, cider... [continues until Flim and Flam begin singing]
215146 What do you think, folks? Do you see what the Apples can't? I see it clear as day! I know she does! So does he! C'mon, Ponyville, you know what I'm talking about!
215000 [Flim and Flam]

215000 We're the world famous Flim Flam Brothers
215000 Traveling salesponies nonpareil!
215000 [Flim and Flam]
215000 Yeah!
21500a You got a deal!
2150ec [excited chattering]
215009 Not so fast! No way no how that machine matches up with the care we put in our cider!
21500a But if it really does work, we could make everypony in town happy!
215008 I just don't know, y'all. We've always made cider the same way.
215026 Eeyup. Huh?
215146 We'll sweeten the deal. You supply the apples...
215145 ...We supply the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.
215147 Then we split those sweet sweet profits...
215146 ...Seventy-five...
215145 ...Twenty-five.
21500a Deal—
215008 Hold on. Who gets the seventy five?
215146 Why, us, naturally.
215145 And, we'll throw in the magic to power the machine for free.
215008 Cider sales keep our business afloat through the winter. We'd lose Sweet Apple Acres if we agreed to this.
215147 So? What'll it be?
215026 No deal.
215146 Hmph. Very well. If you refuse our generous offer to be partners, then we'll just have to be competitors.
215008 You wouldn't dare.
215146 Oh no?
215145 Don't you worry, everypony! There'll be plenty of cider for all of you!
215146 [quietly] Once we drive Sweet Apple Acres out of business.
21500b [gasps]
21500a What?
215000 [clinking of bits]
215000 [tap clunking]
215003 Still worried about Flim and Flam?
215005 Granny Smith says they were just blowing hot air.
215008 I'm not so sure. They sounded mighty serious when they threatened to run us out of business.
21500a That's it! Last cup!
21500c Oh, for Pete's sake!
2150ec [sighs of disappointment]
21500a C'mon back tomorrow, everypony!
2150ec [complaining]
215000 [Cider Squeezy 6000 clunking]
215000 [crunch]
215146 What seems to be the problem here?
215145 Oh my, oh my, out of cider again?
215146 What have we here? Who'd like a cup?
2150ec [cries of excitement]
215145 Don't worry, everypony, we've got the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to make more in an instant!
215000 [crunch]
215008 You can't sell that cider! That's made from Apple family apples!
21500c Is this some kind of cruel joke?
215146 Don't worry, everypony, there are plenty of apples in Equestria. We'll find some others and make more cider than all of Ponyville can drink!
2150ec [gasps]
21500a We'll make more cider than you could ever imagine!
2150ec [gasps]
215009 Now, it ain't about the speed, young'un, it's about quality.
2150ec [disappointed sighs]
21500c Who cares how good the cider is if I never get to drink any?
215146 Oh, look at these poor, dissatisfied ponies.
21500a Ponyville is Sweet Apple Cider country!
215008 Our cider speaks for itself!
215146 Let's put it to the test!
21500a Anywhere, anytime!
2150ec [shocked muttering]
215009 Well, that's enough now.
215145 With our machine, we can make enough cider in one hour to satisfy this entire town!
21500a We'll do it in 45 minutes!
2150ec [Wow, really? etc.]
215009 Easy, Apple Bloom, easy.
215146 What's the matter, Granny Smith? Chicken?
215009 What did you call me, sonny?
215146 If you're so confident in your cider, then what's the problem?
215009 Tomorrow mornin', right here!
215145 But I'm afraid we haven't any... [spits] ...apples.
215009 You can use our south field! It'll be worth it to teach y'all a thing or two about cider making!
215146 Excellent; we have a bet. Whoever produces the most barrels in one hour wins the exclusive right to sell cider in Ponyville.
215009 And after we beat ya, I don't never want to see you bambahoozlers around here again!
2150ec [chattering]
215145 Until tomorrow.
215000 [Cider Squeezy 6000 driving off]
215003 Don't worry, Applejack, I know you'll win tomorrow!
215008 We'd better, 'cause if we don't, we're gonna lose our farm.
215009 [sniffing]
215008 [sounds of exertion]
215003 Applejack? Are you sure this is such a good idea?
215008 Me 'n' the family are... one hundred percent confident... in our cider making capabilities.
21500a And besides, nopony calls Granny a chicken.
215010 [through megaphone] Attention, everypony!
215003 Well, good luck.
215008 Thanks, Twilight. We'll need it.
215010 [through megaphone] The teams have one hour to produce as much cider as they can, after which the barrels will be counted and the winner will be named the sole cider provider for all of Ponyville!
2150ec [shocked gasp]
215010 Are both teams ready?
215009 [snorts]
215008 Ready!
215147 Ready!
215010 Then let's... go!
215000 [crackling electricity and vacuum sounds]
215009 Ugh, bad 'un. Good 'un! Bad 'un...
215008 Great job, y'all! We've already filled an entire barrel!
21500a I'll bet you those guys don't even have—
215148 [gasps]
21500a What?!
215000 [machine noises from Cider Squeezy 6000]
215008 [gulps]
215000 [dings and buzzes]
215000 [apples thudding]
215008 C'mon, Apple Bloom, focus! We gotta forget those guys if we're gonna have a chance of winnin'!
21500a Sorry, sis! Better keep up, Granny, we're fallin' behind!
215009 Egh... [sniffs] Good 'un... Ugh, bad 'un...
215008 Rest when it's over, Big McIntosh! Ride! Ride!
21500d This is just dreadful. Even at top speed the Apples are only making one barrel to the twins' three!
215003 Um, Miss Mayor! Are honorary family members allowed to help in the competition?
215010 Well, I'm not sure... Flim, Flam, would you object to honorary family members helping?
215146 Are you kidding?
215145 We don't care if the whole kingdom of Canterlot helps. It's a lost cause.
215010 Hm, I guess it's okay. Applejack? What do you think?
215008 I think I'd love to have the rest of my family helpin' out.
215024 All right!
215003 Okay, everypony, we're not gonna let those smooth talkers take our friend's farm.
215025 Yeah!
215003 Fluttershy, help Applejack with the trees.
21500e Got it.
215003 Pinkie Pie, you're on apple catching detail.
215007 Yessir, ma'am, sir!
215003 Rarity, you've got a discerning eye. Help Granny Smith at the quality control station.
21500d Of course.
215003 Rainbow Dash, do you think you can help Big McIntosh press?
21500c In my sleep!
215003 Alright, everypony, let's save Sweet Apple Acres!
215025 All right!
215000 [clattering sounds]
215007 Over there, Apple Bloom! Don't miss them!
21500a Right behind you, Pinkie Pie!
215009 Good 'un, bad 'un, bad 'un, good 'un...
21500d Lovely, horrid, horrid, lovely...
215003 Based on these figures, we're making five barrels for every three of theirs!
2150ec [cheering]
215008 Keep it up, everypony! We're back in this!
215146 [spits] Come on, brother, we've gotta pick up the pace!
215145 Right, uh, double the power!
215000 [electric sounds]
215146 We've gotta try something else!
215145 I've got it, brother of mine.
215000 [Cider Squeezy 6000 dinging]
215146 Well done, Flam! We're at top productivity!
2150ec [cheering]
215003 C'mon, Rainbow Dash, keep grinding!
21500c We don't have time for quality control if we wanna win this thing!
215009 [yelps] Get back, you! One bad apple spoils the bunch!
21500c Applejack, help me!
215008 There's no point in winnin' if we cheat!
215003 We'll just have to work harder! C'mon, everypony!
21500c All right then, double time!
215010 Time's up!
215149 [groans]
2150ec [cheering]
215010 [mumbling]
215003 I'm proud of you, Applejack.
215008 Thanks. [pants]
215003 Integrity like that will always be... rewarded.
215010 Flim and Flam win!
2150ec [shocked gasp, "What?", etc.]
21500a Wh, wh—
215008 We... lost?
215146 Daww, too bad, Apples.
215145 Guess you'll just have to find a new line of work that doesn't match your names quite so... perfectly.
215146 Now should we tear down all these tacky old buildings and put up new ones, brother?
215145 I don't see why not, brother. After all, this isn't Sweet Apple Acres anymore. How about 'Flim Flam Fields'?
21500c I ought to press you into jerk cider!
215008 No, Rainbow Dash. A deal's a deal.
215147 [laughing]
215008 Congratulations to y'all. The cider business in Ponyville... is yours. C'mon, Apples. Let's go pack up our things.
215146 Fear not, everypony, there's more than enough cider to go around.
215147 [laughing]
215008 Go ahead, everypony. Go on, y'all. It's okay.
215007 [crying]
215145 Drink up, Ponyville! Down the hatch!
21500f [spitting] [grunting]
2150a7 I can't get the taste off my tongue!
215027 Mine's got rocks in it!
21514a I wouldn't pay one cent for this dreck!
215145 You wouldn't pay even one cent?
2150ec No!
215147 [mumbling to each other]
215145 How about two cups for one cent?
2150ec No!
215147 [mumbling to each other] Two bits for a barrel?
2150ec NO!
215145 [nervous noises] It looks like we've encountered a slight... problem here in Ponyville.
215146 Nopony wants our product. Next town?
215145 Next town. Let's go, Flim!
215146 Let's go, Flam!
215000 [Cider Squeezy 6000 driving off]
215008 They're gone.
215003 That means Sweet Apple Acres is still in business!
215059 Plus we can have high quality Apple family cider!
21500a Because of this silly competition, we've made enough of our cider for the whole town!
2150ec [cheering]
215008 Dear Princess Celestia,
215008 I wanted to share my thoughts with you. [clears throat] I didn't learn anythin'! Ha! I was right all along! If you take your time to do things the right way, your work will speak for itself. Sure I could tell you I learned something about how my friends are always there to help me, and I can count on them no matter what, but truth is, I knew that already too.

216000 [whooshing noises]
216003 Hey, Rarity. Hey, Pinkie Pie. What are you looking at?
216007 Rainbow Dash! Isn't she the most daring devil? I mean, the most devilish darer? I mean—
21600d She's dazzling!
216007 Ooh, yeah, that's a good word. She's dazzling!
21614b [gasp]
216003 Oh no, oh no, oh no!
216007 Ai yi yi yi yi!
216000 [crunch]
21614b Oohh.
216007 So much for dazzling.
216000 [theme song]
216000 [heart monitor beeping]
216008 [muffled] Is she gonna be okay?
21600e [muffled] Oh, I'm so worried!
216007 [muffled] Is her face gonna stay that way?
21600c Awwww.
216003 How is she, doctor?
21614c She's going to be fine. Luckily she has friends like you who got her over here in a jiffy.
21600c Huh, how long do I need to lie here? I've got things I need to do!
21614c Well, that all depends on your recovery, but I'd say a few days minimum.
21600c You guys have gotta get me out of here! I'm gonna climb the walls!
216007 Ooh, just like a spider! [to Doctor Horse] Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?
21614c Nnnno, nor did it give her amazing healing powers. She needs to stay in bed for a few days.
21600c Few days? Might as well be a few months, or a few years!
21600e It's not so bad, Rainbow Dash.
216008 I bet the chow in here is hoof-lickin' good.
21600d And the hospital gowns, they...match the curtains!
216007 And look! You have a roommate!
216000 [wheels squeaking]
21600c What's this? 'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Stone'.
216003 This is the first story in the series. I own all of them. [squee]
21600c No thanks. I so don't read. I'm a world-class athlete. Reading's for eggheads like you, Twilight. Heh, no offense, but I am not reading. It's undeniably, unquestionably, uncool.
21611a [laughing]
216008 Is she serious? Who doesn't like to read a bang-up tale from time to time?
21600d Why, a good book is almost as magnificent as silk pajamas on a Sunday morning, heh!
216003 Reading is for everypony, Rainbow Dash!
216007 Yeah! I love reading, and my head isn't even close to the shape of an egg! It's more the shape of an apple, or maybe an orange, but a big orange! More like a grapefruit really...
21614d All right, my little ponies. Rainbow Dash needs her rest. You'll have to come back tomorrow.
216003 I think you'd like Daring. She's a lot like you. Adventurous, fierce, and undeniably, unquestionably, unstoppable.
216000 [door closes]
216000 [clock ticking]
216000 [ball bouncing]
216000 [glass clinking, sloshing, etc.]
216000 [light clicking]
21600c ...to get to the other side! Get it? Never mind...
216000 [clock ticking]
21600c [growls in frustration] [sighs]
216000 [Dash's head banging on bed]
21600c [sighs] [unenthusiastically] "As Daring Do trekked through the tropical jungle, the wet heat sapped her energy and slowed her every step. If only she could escape this oppressive atmosphere and fly up into the cool blue sky. But her crash landing in the jungle had injured her wing and she was grounded for a few days. Few days... it might as well be a few months, or a few years!" Huh. I'm right there with you, sister.
21600c [voiceover] "The mosquitoes buzzed loudly. The macaws cried from the high trees. Yet all of these distracting noises were not enough to cover the sound of the predators following her every step."
216000 [various big cats growling and roaring]
216000 [kitten mewing]
21600c [voiceover] "Safely landing on the other side, Daring finally allowed herself a moment to breathe. She turned around to find herself face to face with the long lost temple that she had sought tirelessly for over sixty days and nights!"
21600c I hate to admit it to myself, and would really hate to admit it to my friends, but... I love this story! I, I... I love reading! ...I'm an egghead.
21600c [voiceover] "The smell of decay and danger hit Daring Do as she peered into the dimly-lit entrance of the ancient temple."
216000 [beetles scuttling]
216000 [clunk]
216000 [various noises: metal hitting stone, fire whooshing, alligators snapping, shing!, etc.]
216000 [thud]
21614e Phew!
216000 [clunk]
21614e [exasperated sigh]
216000 [cacophony of noises; pots clanging, monkeys screeching, party horns blowing, etc.]
216000 [knocking]
216084 Hi, Rainbow Dash!
21600c Uh, hey, guys...
21600e We thought we'd come and cheer you up!
216003 We brought your favorite board game!
21600e We know how much you like to win!
216003 You go first, Rainbow Dash!
21600c [short nervous laugh] No no, you first.
216003 Alright, uh... cloud three.
21600c Aw, shucks, you... rained on my cumulus, heh. Go again!
21600e Um... sky five?
21600c Whoa, you found my seagull.
216000 [seagull crying]
216003 Uh... cloud two?
21600c You zapped my weather pony! Uh-huh, you stung my bumblebee. Oh, my thunderbolt. Aw, and that's my last cloud. You found it. Guess you guys win, I lose. [nickers]
21600e But Rainbow Dash, you, you didn't even get a turn.
21600c You win some, you lose some.
216003 But you don't lose some. I don't think you've ever lost a game of—
21600c [yawns] Thanks for coming!
216003 But yesterday you were desperate for things to do!
21600c Do? Who said anything about Daring Do? I told you I'm not interested in reading. [yawns] It's nap time for me! [mocks snoring]
21600e Glad we could... cheer you up?
21600c [yawns]
216003 Alright then.
216000 [door closes]
21600c "Daring Do stood at the entrance to the central temple chamber."
21600c [voiceover] "At last, she was face-to-face with the legendary sapphire statue!"
216000 [stone clinking]
216000 [arrows firing]
21614e Hmm, there must be a pattern here. What do all these animals have in common? Ah-ha! These animals are all predators... except... rats! Phew!
216000 [stone grinding]
216000 [rumbling]
216000 [lava bubbling]
216000 [thud]
21614f Hello, Rainbow Dash!
216000 [heart monitor beeping]
21600d How's our patient doing today?
216008 Ugh, we need to get some fresh air in here. You're lookin' sweatier than a pig wrangler on a summer's day.
21600c Uh, well, guys, thanks for visiting, but—
216150 Okay, now, dinner time for Rainbow Dash.
21600c Oh, just in time. I am sooo hungry.
21600d Oh, well, don't mind us, Rainbow Dash.
216008 Yeah, just go ahead and eat up.
21600c [loud chewing sounds]
21600d Uh, on second thought—
216007 Uh, we'll see you tomorrow, Rainbow Dash, aheh...
216000 [door closes]
21600c [spits] "'You thought you could evade me and capture the relic for yourself, but you are sadly mistaken, Miss Do.'"
216151 And now, you shall meet your doom! [blows whistle]
216000 [various big cat sounds plus kitten mewling]
216151 [laughs manically]
21600c Whoa! Who is this dude?
21614e [pants] You won't get away with this, Ahuizotl!
216151 But I already have.
216000 [clanking]
21614e [exasperated sigh] Not again...
216000 [snakes hissing]
21614e Quicksand! [sounds of exertion]
21614c [echoing] Rainbow Dash?
21614c [muffled] Rainbow Dash? [normal] Rainbow Da-ash!
21600c H— oh, good evening—
21614c Morning.
21600c —morning. Doc.
21614c Have you been up all night?
21600c Uh, of course not. [blows]
21614c Well, I'll be quick. Congratulations, Rainbow Dash, we're checking you out of the hospital.
21600c What? Later today? [teeth chattering]
21614c No. Right now!
21600c Right now?! 'Right now' right now?
21614c 'Right now' right now.
216000 [struggling sounds]
21600c But I don't feel better!
21614c Now take it easy, Rainbow Dash. Remember to stay off that wing for a week.
216000 [door opening and closing]
21600c How will I ever find out what happens to Daring Do?!
21600c Is Ahuizotl going to get away with the statuette? What's gonna happen to Daring?! Ah-ha! Twilight has a copy of the book! Uh, but I can't ask her after I called her an egghead and all...
216000 [thud]
21600c Ugh, this is making me sick all over again!
21600c Owww... [grunts in pain unrealistically] Oh, the pain... the pain!
21614c Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here, a-anything wrong?
21600c Well, uh, my wing! It's still hurtin', Doc. Oh, ouch! Right there.
21614c I was touching your good wing.
21600c Uh, right. Well, I think that one's hurting now too.
21614c [chuckles] I think I know what the trouble is. A severe case of lazy-itis.
21600c B-But, you got me all wrong, Doc! I'm not being lazy!
21614c You're fine, Rainbow Dash. Give it some time and you'll be right back in the swing of things.
21614d Good day, Rainbow Dash.
216150 Take care!
21600c What am I gonna do? I'll never get to sleep without knowing what happens to Daring Do! ...Which may not be such a bad thing...
216000 [owl hoots]
21600c [squee]
216000 [heart monitor beeping]
21614e Feels like the harder I struggle, [grunts] the tighter the ropes get!
216152 Help! Burglar, burglar!
216153 Someone's trying to steal my slippers!
21600c I'm not trying to steal your slippers, I'm trying to steal this book!
216000 [thud]
21614d Stop, thief!
216000 [crunch]
216000 [alarm buzzing]
216000 [barking, continues throughout]
216007 Hey, nopony invited me!
21600d Huh! Hasn't anypony heard of beauty sleep?
21614c Rainbow Dash, what in the world is going on? Why are you stealing slippers?
216154 [barking]
216155 Hey, get back to the hospital!
216008 What's all the ruckus?
216007 Mmm, I'd say it's more of a fracas than a ruckus.
216003 What's going on, Rainbow Dash?
21600c [sighs] I'm an egghead.
21600d Pardon?
21600c See, I was trying to get back into the hospital to finish the last chapter of—
216003 —'Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue'!
21600c You got me.
216003 Wow, I knew the book was good, but I didn't know it could drive a pony to petty theft!
21600c Good? Try awesomely amazing. That book is undeniably, unquestionably, un-put-down-able! But then I had to put it down; I was sent home before I could finish it.
216003 Well, I'm glad that's all this is about.
216008 There's no reason to go around causin' a ruckus—
216007 Fracas!
216008 ...causin' a fracas just because you like to read.
216003 Like I said, I have every book in the series, and you can borrow them all, any time you like!
21600c Oh, thanks, Twilight. I'm sorry I made such a big deal about all of this. I thought reading was just for smart ponies like you.
216003 Rainbow Dash, just because you're athletic doesn't mean you aren't smart!
216005 Yeah, just look at me! [kisses]
216003 Reading is something everypony can enjoy, if they just give it a try.
21600c Yeah, I get it. I shouldn't knock something until I've tried it.
216003 That's a great lesson, and it would make a great letter to the Princess.
21600c [to Spike] Didja get all that?
216005 Yeah?
21600c Great! You write the letter, I've gotta finish this book! [bites]
21614e [sounds of exertion]
216000 [cranking]
21614e [takes deep breaths] Another day, another dungeon!
216151 [laughs evilly] With Daring Do out of the way, the world will suffer mightily at my hands. I am victorious! [laughs]
21614e I'll take that!
216151 Huh? Wha—? Noooooooo!
21614e Better luck next time, Ahuizotl!
216151 Curse you, Daring Do! [cries]
21600c [voiceover] "And so, with Ahuizotl defeated, and the sapphire statue secured..."
21600c "...The world was safe and sound once again, thanks to Daring Do!" [sighs in admiration] 'Daring Do and the Griffon's Goblet'. Awesome!
216000 [music]
216000 [credits]
217000 [indistinct chatter]
217000 [school bell ringing]
21700a Hmm... I just don't feel like it's quite finished.
217066 I know what you mean. If it's for Miss Cheerilee, it needs to be perfect. Hearts and Hooves Day only comes once a year, after all.
217065 I say we add a little more ribbon!
217066 Mm-hmm, yeah, yeah. And just a tiny bit more lace.
21700a A few more hoof-prints.
217065 Glitter! It could definitely use just a little more glitter!
21700a Now that'll show Miss Cheerilee how much we care about her. Just have to get it to the Hearts and Hooves party at school.
217065 I think we're gonna need a bigger envelope.
217000 [theme song]
217000 [background chatter]
21705b It's lovely. And so... big!
21700a We just wanted to let you know that we think you're the best teacher in the whole wide world! And we think you're super! And that we love you so so much! And we want you to have the best Hearts and Hooves Day—
2170ef Ever!
21705b Thank you so much, girls. I love it. I really do.
217066 I'm sure it's nothing compared to the gifts you've gotten from your... very special somepony.
21705b Oh, I don't have a very special somepony at the moment.
21700a Really?
217066 How could somepony as amazing as you not have a very special somepony on Hearts and Hooves Day?
21705b It's alright, Sweetie Belle. I have lots of good friends and wonderful students who care about me very much. I'm gonna have an absolutely terrific Hearts and Hooves Day. Alright, everypony, who's ready to play "Pin the Heart on the Pony"?
217000 [excited responses]
21700a If anypony deserves a very special somepony, it's her.
217066 [gasp]
21700a Uh, you all right?
217066 I'm more than all right. I've just come up with the best idea ever. We're gonna find Miss Cheerilee a very special somepony.
21700a That is the best idea ever.
217066 [singsong voice] Told you!
21700a So what are we waiting for? Hearts and Hooves Day is almost over! Let's get out there and find somepony special for Cheerilee already.
217066 Yeah!
217065 Let's do it!
217066 Now it can't be just anypony. Miss Cheerilee is one of the best mares in Ponyville. She deserves to have one of the best stallions as her very special somepony.
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 Cheerilee is sweet and kind
217066 She's the best teacher we could hope for
217066 The perfect stallion you and I must find
217066 One to really make her heart so-o-oar
217066 But...
217066 This one's too young, this one's too old
217066 He clearly has a terrible cold
217156 Achoo!
21700a [Apple Bloom]
21700a This guy's too silly
21700a He's way too uptight
217157 I say!
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 Well nothing's wrong with this one
217066 He seems alright
217065 His girlfriend sure thinks so.
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 How 'bout this one?
21700a [Apple Bloom]
21700a He's much too flashy
217065 [Scootaloo]
217065 He might do
217000 [Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle]
217000 If he weren't so splashy
21700a [Apple Bloom]
21700a Too short
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 Too tall
21700a [Apple Bloom]
21700a Too clean
217065 [Scootaloo]
217065 Too smelly
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 Too strangely obsessed with tubs of jelly
217080 [sigh]
21700a [Apple Bloom]
21700a I don't think that we're mistaken
21700a It seems all the good ones are taken
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 I really feel that at this rate
217066 We'll never find the perfect date
217080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
217080 Don't wanna quit and give up hope
217065 Doing anything special for Hearts and Hooves Day?
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 Oh please, oh please oh please say...
217026 Nope.
217080 [gasp]
217066 [Sweetie Belle]
217066 We did it girls, we've found the one
217066 Who will send our teacher's heart aflutter
21700a Wait a minute. Lemme get this straight. Are you talkin' 'bout my brother?
217065 Sweetie Belle is right. Big McIntosh is the perfect match for Miss Cheerilee. He's really nice, super hard-working.
21700a Hmm... but he's also pretty shy. He's never gonna ask Miss Cheerilee to be his very special somepony.
217066 Maybe he doesn't have to.
21700a Huh?
217066 If we can get Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee in a really romantic setting, I bet she'll ask him.
217065 Sounds like a plan to me.
21700a So? What are we waitin' for? Let's get out there and create the perfect date!
2170ef Yay!
217066 Flowers. Don't forget the flowers.
21700a Oops. I'm on it!
217065 [gasp] They're coming! This is gonna be perfect. Miss Cheerilee is gonna have the best Hearts and Hooves Day ever.
217066 With her new very special somepony.
2170ef [giggling]
21705b Hi, girls.
2170ef Hi, Miss Cheerilee.
21705b So you three said you needed help identifying a tree you found here near the gazebo? ...That's an apple tree.
21700a Is it?
2170ef [giggling]
21700a Oh, sorry, big brother. We went and fixed up the gazebo all on our own. See?
217065 As long as you're here, why not have a bite to eat from this romantic-looking picnic? Oh gosh, seems like there's only room for two.
21700a I guess we'll just be goin' then.
217000 [gramophone playing]
217065 You really think this'll work?
217066 Of course it will work. They're perfect for each other.
21705b Beautiful day we're having.
217026 Eeyup.
21705b Any big plans for tonight?
217026 Nnnope.
21700a Oh, come on, Miss Cheerilee, ask him to be your very special somepony.
217066 [gasp] Ohmigosh, look.
21705b Big Mac...
217026 Eeyup?
21705b You have something stuck in your teeth.
217000 [record scratch]
217066 Aw, come on!
217000 [record plays erratically]
21705b Well this has been... strange.
217026 Eeyup.
21705b I need to get going, but it's always great running into a good friend.
217026 Yup.
21700a [sigh] Do you think it just wasn't romantic enough?
217065 Maybe it was too romantic.
217066 [sigh] Either way, we failed.
21700a [sigh] There's gotta be somethin' else we could— UGH!
217003 Oh my goodness, I didn't even see you there. I'm so so sorry.
21700a Aw, it's okay, Twilight. It was an accident.
217003 I've just been reading the most fascinating book about Hearts and Hooves Day. Did you know that this holiday got its start because of a love potion?
217066 Did you say... a love potion?
217003 That's right. It even has the recipe.
217066 I... don't suppose we could borrow that book for a little while, do ya?
217003 Of course you can. I have another book here that I think you'll—
217066 [giggling] Take a tuft of cloud;
217065 [chomp]
217000 [splash]
217066 A bright rainbow's glow;
217000 [vacuum noise]
217000 [vacuum noise]
217066 Stir with a Pegasus feather—
217000 [plink]
217065 Hey!
217066 Fast, not slow.
21700a Serve to two ponies who aren't in the know.
21700a I feel kind of bad trickin' my brother and Miss Cheerilee this way.
217066 What's the problem? We all agreed these two are perfect for one another.
217065 Yeah, they just need a little nudge.
217066 And what could make them happier than being together, right?
21700a Right!
217065 Oh, oh, here they come.
21700a Hiya, Miss Cheerilee.
21705b Hello again, girls. Hello, Big Mac. Would you three like to tell us why it was so very important that we meet you here—
217066 Punch!
21705b Excuse me?
217066 Punch! We made punch. We were gonna set up a stand and try to sell it but, heh, we needed somepony to taste-test it first.
21700a Yup.
217066 We thought you two would be perfect together. To test it. Together. So, uh, we'll just leave you two alone. Together, to test it. [giggling]
21705b I'm very sorry about this. I mentioned to the girls that I don't have a very special somepony, and I believe they're putting us in these awkward situations because they've decided it should be you.
217158 [chuckling]
21705b I suppose we should just humor them for a moment. This punch does look delicious.
217026 Eeyup.
217066 I think they're gonna drink it.
21705b To good friends!
217000 [glasses clink]
217065 They're drinking it. They're drinking it!
217158 [hiccup]
217065 They're looking into each other's eyes.
2170ef [giggling] They're about to be in for a big surprise!
21705b Big Mac?
217026 Yup?
21705b Will you be my very special somepony?
217026 Eeyup.
217066 YES!
2170ef [singsong voice] He's her special somepony! She's his special somepony!
21705b He's my special somepony.
217026 Eeeeeyup.
2170ef Aww!
21705b He's my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
217026 You're my shmoopy-doopy sweetie-weetie pony pie.
21700a Did he just say—
21705b You're my cutie-patootie lovie-dovie honey-bunny.
217026 You're my heartie-smartie smoochie-woochie baby-waby.
21700a Big Mac! Hey! Hello! What's going on?
217066 Miss Cheerilee, are you alright?
21705b I have a special somepony. A kissy-wissy snuggy-wuggy sugar bear.
217066 I think we may have given them too big of a nudge.
217026 You're my cuddly-wuddly boopsie-woopsie pumpkin pie.
217105 Eugh!!
217065 Ya think?
21700a What have we done?! My brother's actin' like a grade-A goofball!
217066 Maybe we added too much rainbow.
217065 Or maybe not enough cloud.
217066 Or maybe... uh-oh.
21700a Whaddaya mean, "uh-oh?!"
217066 We might not have given Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee a love potion. We may have given them a love poison.
21707f What?!
217066 Apparently, some prince a long time ago whipped up this recipe and gave it to this princess he liked. He meant it to be a love potion, but things didn't turn out so well.
21700a How "not so well" did things turn out?
217066 Well, there's something here about a dragon, the kingdom falling, chaos reigning... Okay, apparently it was all because the prince and princess were so lost in each other's eyes that they couldn't perform their royal duties.
21700a Great! We've not only turned Big Mac and Miss Cheerilee into a couple of nonsense-spoutin' nincompoops, we may have put all of Ponyville in jeopardy!
217065 Come on, Apple Bloom. Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac don't have any royal duties.
21700a But they still got responsibilities. If we don't fix this... Oh no, Miss Cheerilee won't be able to teach. Big Mac won't be able to harvest any apples, and before you know it... Ponyville will be overrun with uneducated little ponies starvin' for apples. Oh, it'll be chaos! It'll be chaos!
217066 There's an antidote!
21700a Well, why didn't you say so? Didn't you see me gettin' all panicked back there?
217066 If we can keep Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac from looking into each other's eyes for one full hour, the love curse will be broken.
217065 Only an hour? Pfh, we can pull that off in a second.
21705b You take the first sip, snuggle-wuggles.
217026 No, you take it, schnoodle-dumplin'.
21705b No, you, shnooky-lumps.
217026 No, you, pookie-pie.
21702a I'm all for romance, but this has been going on for hours. What's happened to these two?
217066 [nervous chuckle] Who knows?
21702a Well, these lovebirds will probably be planning a wedding soon. I can always use the catering business.
217066 A wedding! That's it! Miss Cheerilee and Big Mac should get married!
21700a How is gettin' hitched gonna keep them apart?
217066 They aren't really gonna get married. They're just gonna get ready to get married.
21705b [chuckle] No, you, biscuit-wiscuit bear!
217026 Nope, you, huggy-wuggy snuggy bunny!
217066 Hi, Miss Cheerilee, how are you?
21705b I have a very special somepony.
217000 [clank]
217026 I have a very special somepony.
21700a Yeah, we noticed.
217000 [squeaking]
217066 Gosh, you two are so in love, the next thing you know, you'll be getting married.
217000 [smack]
217158 Married?!
217066 That's right. Maaarriiied.
217158 Married...
21700a [gagging] Ugh!
217000 [squeaking]
21700a 'Course, if you're gonna get married, you wanna pick out a really nice diamond for your—ugh!—shmoopy-doopy, uh, pookie-pie.
217026 Diamond!
21705b Shmoopy!
217065 Don't you think you should start looking for your wedding dress? You'll wanna look your best for your... [straining] honey-bunny snuggle-baby.
217000 [spring]
21705b Oh! Dress!
217000 [crash]
217066 Now we just need to keep them apart. I'll keep Miss Cheerilee occupied. You two do the same with Big Mac.
21700a No problem.
217000 [clock ticking]
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
217066 Meet you back at the clubhouse in an hour when this whole mess is over.
217066 This one looks nice. Better try it on though.
217000 [furniture clattering]
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
217066 Ten minutes down, fifty minutes to go.
217000 [flapping]
21700a No.
217000 [flapping]
21700a No.
217000 [flapping]
21700a Not that one either.
217000 [flapping]
21700a No.
217000 [flapping]
21700a Too... shiny. No. You know, somethin' less... shiny.
217159 Mmm.
21700a Miss Cheerilee deserves the best. [to Scootaloo] How much time is left? I'm runnin' out of ways to make diamonds sound bad.
217065 We still have twenty five minutes.
21700a [sigh] [anxious] Where's my brother?
217159 He made his purchase and departed out the back. Said something about needing to see his... shmoopy-shmoo.
217065 Ugh.
21700a [gagging]
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
21700a Okay, I'll see what I can do to slow him down. You go on to Carousel Boutique and warn Sweetie Belle.
217000 [wheels creaking]
21700a Huh—
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
21700a [gasp]
217065 [gasping]
217066 What's wrong? Where's Apple Bloom? Where's Big Mac?
217065 On [gasp] his [grunt] way. Gotta [grunt] keep him [gasp] out of boutique.
21700a Huh?
217000 [creaking]
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
217065 Move away!
21700a He'll get to her! He's too strong!
217066 Let him go!
217026 Shmoopy-doo— Whoa!
217065 [sigh] I sure am glad you found those shovels.
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
21700a One more minute and the spell will be broken!
217026 Shmoopy-doo!
21705b Sweetums?!
217000 [crash]
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
217000 [crash]
217026 Shmoopy-doo!
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
217000 [clock ticking]
217000 [crash]
21700a Aaaa—
217000 [smack]
217000 [clock-tower bell chimes]
21700a Oh, please be normal, please be normal.
21705b Am I wearing a wedding veil?
217026 Eeyup.
21705b Are you sitting on a feather bed in a hole in the ground?
217026 Eeyup.
21705b Girls! Can you explain why I look like I'm getting married at the bottom of a pit?
217066 We may have given you the teeny-tiniest bit of love potion... that may have turned out to actually be a love poison, and you may have gone just a teeny-tiniest bit nutty.
21700a But we only did it because we thought you and Big Mac would be really happy if you could be each others very special someponies on Hearts and Hooves Day.
217065 Our hearts and hooves were in the right place.
21705b We appreciate that you care about us and want us to be happy but—
21700a But no matter how good our intentions might have been, we shoulda never meddled in your relationship.
217065 Nopony can force two ponies to be together.
217066 It's up to everypony to choose that very special somepony for themselves.
2170ef We're sorry.
21705b And you can think about how sorry you are while you're doing all of Big Mac's chores at Sweet Apple Acres. Does that seem like a fair punishment to you?
217026 Eeyup.
2170ef [sigh]
21700a Hey there, Miss Cheerilee! What are you doin' here?
21705b Since you three are doing all of his chores, Big Mac and I thought we'd have a picnic at the gazebo. Ready, sugar bear?
217026 Eeyup, pumpkin pie.
2170ef [gasp] NOOOOO!!!

218029 Oh ya, Pinkie, don'tcha know?
218007 Well, Mrs Cake just baked a fresh batch of your favorite oatmeal.
218029 Mooo, sounds delightful!
218007 Oh, Rose, your Calla lilies look even better than last year! I bet you'll take first prize at the flower show again.
21802f Thanks, Pinkie! Would you like one?
218007 Absolutely! [chomps] Looking fit as a fiddle, Mr Waddle, and you're wearing my favorite tie!
21815a Aw, shucks, Miss Pinkie, you flatterer you.
218007 Well, happy birthday, Cheerilee.
21805b Thank you, Pinkie.

218007 And maybe you feel sad
218007 But Pinkie will be there to show you that it isn't that bad
218007 There's one thing that makes me happy and makes my whole life worthwhile
218007 And that's when I talk to my friends and get them to smile
218007 I really am so happy
218007 Your smile fills me with glee
218007 I give a smile I get a smile
218007 And that's so special to me
218007 'Cause I love to see you beam, beam, beam
218007 Yes I do
218007 Tell me what more can I say to make you see
218007 That I do

218007 Come on and smile
218007 Come on and smile
218007 I've never seen you before.
21815c Kid, you're smarter than you look.
218007 Thanks! I'm Pinkie Pie. What's your name? "Property of C.D.D." I'm guessing that last "D" is for "Donkey".
21815c Quick as a whip, kid.
218007 Now, how 'bout that "C"? Hmm... Calvin? Calhoun? Caleb? Carl? Carmine? Carlo? Charlie? Chester? Chico? Claudio? Cletus? Clifford? Coraline? Cornelius? Cortez? Crank? Christopher–?
21815c Cranky! It's Cranky, alright?!
218007 And your middle name?
21815c [mumbles] Doodle.
218007 I'm sorry?
21815c [quickly] Doodle.
218007 One more time...!
21815c [sighs] Doodle.
218007 [gasps] So you're a Cranky Doodle Donkey?
218007 [Pinkie Pie]
218007 You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey guy.
218007 A Cranky Doodle Donkey.
218007 I never met you but you're my new friend
218007 and I'm your best friend Pinkie Pie!
218007 C'mon now, Doodle, give a smile!
21815c Nopony calls me Doodle!
218007 What just happened? Meet somepony new, check. Introduce myself, check. Sing random song outta nowhere, check. Become instant best friends... uncheck. I don't get it. How can somepony not become instant best friends with me? Was it something I said? Was it something I sang? This is no time for the blame game, Pinkie! There's somepony new in town, and you need to win him over! 'Try everything you can to make Cranky smile and be your friend'... Check!
218007 Alright, Pinkie. If you're gonna win Cranky's friendship, you're gonna have to bring your A game! Let's do this. Howdy-doody, Cranky Doodle! So, uh, are you moving to Ponyville, Cranky?
21815c What gave you the hint there, kid? The cart full of stuff, maybe?
218007 Well, I'd be happy to show you around. It's the least a new friend can do.
21815c Listen, kid, I traveled around Equestria my entire life. I've made many friends. I don't need any more.
218007 Gosh! I could never have too many friends!
21815c Well, why don't you go and make some more?
218007 But I don't need to go when I can stay and make friends... with you.
21815c Look, kid, y–
218007 Oh, Cranky, you can call me Pinkie. All of my friends do.
21815c Look, kid, I came to Ponyville for some peace and quiet and privacy, to be alone with my memories. All I want is to get to my new home and unpack my stuff.
218007 Ooh, what does this bauble do?
21815c Don't touch that!
218007 Ooooooh, what's this?
21815c Please, don't!
218007 Oooh, look at these!
218000 [windchimes chime]
218007 Eeeheeeheee!
21815c Pinkie! Keep your hooves off my wagon!
218007 Okay, Cranky. [gasps] [quickly] I promised not to touch your wagon, so I brought one of my own! I use it to welcome folks!
21815c Who'd'a guessed?
218007 Maybe we can be wagon buddies! Well, you've gotta at least let me give you the special welcome that comes with it... [whimper]
21815c [groans] Let's get this over with.
218007 That's the spirit!
218007 [Pinkie Pie]
218007 Welcome welcome welcome
218007 A fine welcome to you
218007 Welcome welcome welcome
218007 I say how do you do?
218007 Welcome welcome welcome
218007 I say hip hip hurray
218007 Welcome welcome welcome
218007 To Ponyville today
218007 Wait for it...!
218000 [ding]
218000 [party kazoos blow]
21815c Noooo!
218000 [splat]
218007 Oh, silly me! I must've put the confetti in the oven and the cake in the confetti cannons! Again! [giggles] [chomps] Mmm, still delicious! Try some, Cranky, it's sure to make you smile.
21815c Oh, where is it, where is it?
218007 Where's what? [yelps] Spider! Big hairy spider!
21815c Stop, stop, stop!
218007 Oh. Was that your wig?
21815c [growls]
218007 I can fix this, I can fix this! [through megaphone] Hey, everypony! Does anypony have a toupee?!
21800f [Huh?, Toupee?, etc.]
218007 This donkey is really, really, bald!
21800f [laughing]
218007 [through megaphone] What's so funny? This is serious business, everypony! Cranky needs a new wig to cover his hairless head!
21815c I have had enough!
218007 Oh, you're losing him, Pinkie. Wait, Cranky! Please, let me make it up to you!
21815c No!
218007 Please! Oh, please please please... [fades out]
218007 Ladies, this is a spa emergency. Cranky needs help, STAT.
21815c [groans]
218007 Hi, Cranky! I have a gift for you!
21815c The spa treatment was gift enough.
218007 It's not going to explode or anything. Promise. Just open it! It's a new toupee! I had my friend Rarity make it. She calls it the "dreamboat special".
21815c This is wonderful. Thanks, kid.
218007 He's starting to warm up, but still no smile. Hmmm.
218007 Hey! Whatcha doing there, ol' buddy ol' pal?
21815c What's it look like?
218007 Looks like a yard sale. I'll give you two bits for this!
218000 [snow globe jingles]
21815c I'm not selling, kid. I'm unpacking.
218007 Well, why didn't you say so?
21815c I thought I had.
218007 This is so pretty! Where'd you get it?
21815c Manehattan. Now put it down, gently.
218007 Really? What were you doin' there?
21815c Trying to find a friend.
218007 Oooh, I'm always trying to find friends, and today I found you. See how good I am at it?
21815c This was a special friend.
218007 Like me?
21815c No, you're extra special, kid.
218007 [to herself] Yes! I'm in! [to Cranky] Woow, where in Equestria did you get this, Cranky?
21815c Fillydelphia.
218007 It's awfully pretty.
21815c Yes, she was.
218007 Huh?
21815c I mean, it was– I mean, it is. Yes, it's pretty. Now put it down!
218007 I wonder where Cranky got this. Huh. Will you look at that? Hey, Cranky! Can I ask you about–
218000 [crunch]
218000 [crash]
218007 Oh no!
21815c What did you say-ayayayayay! What have you done?!
218007 There! Uh, all better?
21815c No, not all better, all soggy!
218007 I'm sorry, Cranky!
21815c Oh, you're sorry! Well, then, everything is fine!
218007 ...It is?
21815c No! It isn't! Listen to me, kid, I will never be your friend!
218007 Never, or never-ever?
21815c Never, ever, ever, ever, ever!
218000 [door slams]
218007 That's four 'evers'. That's like... forever!
218007 I just can't believe it. Cranky said he would never forever be my friend. It was horrible.
218003 I know this is hard for you, Pinkie, seeing that you're friends with everypony, but you just have to accept that Cranky is gonna be an exception. He just... doesn't want to be bothered.
21800c Yeah, he doesn't want to be bothered by your over-the-top super-hyper antics.
218003 Rainbow!
218007 No, no, it's okay, Twilight. I get what you're saying. What you're both saying. And I guess... I can leave Cranky alone. ...Right after he accepts my apology!
218007 Cranky!
21815c No! No! Leave me alone!
218007 Wait! I understand that you don't want me as a friend!
21815c No, I don't!
218007 So I just wanted to say 'I'm sorry'!
21815c Fine! You said it!
218007 But do you accept my apology?
21815c No!
218007 Oh, Cranky! Please accept my apology! Please!
21815c No!
218007 But I'm really, really, really...
21815c [gasps]
218007 ...really, really...
21815c [sighs] Ah!
218007 ...really, really, really...
218007 [muffled] ...really, really, really...
218007 ...really, really, really...
218007 ...really, really, really, really...
218007 ...really, really, really, really... [many quick "really"s] ...sorry!
218000 [hammering, locks clinking]
218000 [knocking]
218007 Cranky, please, please accept my apology!
218000 [slam]
218007 I'd do anything to make it up to you!
21815c But there's nothing you can do! You ruined my book! You destroyed all I have to remember her by!
218007 Her? Her who? The special friend?
21815c Go away, Pinkie! [sighs]
218000 [knocks]
218007 [muffled] Cranky? It's me again. I understand that you don't wanna be my friend or accept my apology... Before I leave you alone forever, I have something to at least try to make up for ruining your book.
21815c No, I don't want it, kid! Anything you would give me is sure to lead to some sort of disaster!
21815b [muffled] Goodness, you really are cranky.
218000 [locks and chains jangling]
21815c It can't be... Is it really you?
21815b It can, and it is.
21815c Matilda! But how?
21815b Pinkie.
21815c But... I never told you about her!
218007 You didn't have to. I put two and two and two together and it added up to Matilda.
21815c What?
218007 Well, when you were talking about your souvenirs, you said something about trying to find a special friend! And y'know, I wasn't just born yesterday. Nuh-uh! My birthday isn't for another seventy five days!
21815c Huh?
218007 And then, in your scrapbook, there was a flower, an old ticket, and a menu from the Grand Galloping Gala! And I knew I recognized all these things.
21815c But how could you have ever seen them before?
21815b Because I also have them in my scrapbook.
218007 And I'd seen them in Matilda's book!
21815c Oh, Matilda. The night we met at the Gala was the most magical night of my life.
21815c [voiceover] I couldn't wait to see you again. But when I came to your room the next day, you were gone.
21815b [voiceover] Didn't you get my note?
21815c [voiceover] No, I never got it. Ever since that day I've gone from town to town to town, searching all over Equestria for you...
21815c ...Until finally I gave up. I came to Ponyville to retire from my search.
21815b I was living in Ponyville the whole time. I always hoped that some day you would come and find me... Doodle.
218007 Uh. Matilda? Nopony calls him Doodle.
21815c Nopony... but Matilda. Mmm.
21815b Oh, Doodle, I'm so happy to see you. [kisses]
21815c [braying]
218007 So does this mean that you accept my apology?
21815c Yes, Pinkie, I accept your apology, and I am honored to call you my friend.
218007 [firework explosion] Woo-hoo! This is just fantastic! Ooh, now we can hang out together and chat and sing songs and [gasps] party! Oh, I have to throw you guys a big party! It'll be called the 'Welcome to Ponyville/I Found My Lost Love/I'm BFF's with Pinkie Pie' Party! ...Or maybe something less over-the-top and not so super-hyper.
21815c Pinkie, we're eternally grateful to you. But... Matilda and I just want to spend some time together in peace and quiet.
218007 Oh. Um, but we're still friends?
21815c Pinkie, you went way, way, way out of your way to make me happy. Of course we're friends.
218007 Great!
218007 Dear Princess Celestia,
218007 There are many different kinds of friends, and many ways to express friendship. Some friends like to run and laugh and play together. But others just like to be left alone, and that's fine too. But the best thing about friendship is being able to make your friends smile.
218007 [Pinkie Pie]
218007 He had a Cranky Doodle sweetheart
218007 She's his cranky doodle joy
218007 I helped the Cranky Doodle boy, yeah!
218007 I helped the Cranky Doodle boy!
21815d Pinkie!
218007 Whoops, privacy. Sorry.
218000 [Yankee Doodle Dandy plays over credits]
219000 [bell rings]
21900e Lunch time! Who's hungry?
219000 [animals chittering]
21900e Plenty for everypony. Slow down, sweetie. [giggles]
219040 [thumps on ground]
21900e Here you go, Angel bunny.
219040 [continues thumping]
21900e Okay, Mister Picky-pants, you win. Carrots, lettuce and apples, yum-yum-yum!
219000 [crash]
21900e What? But... Well then, what will you eat? I'm not sure I can even make that. Well... I don't want you to starve... Oh, are you sure I can't tempt you with a nice crisp piece of—
219000 [smack]
21900e [sighs] I'll make your special recipe.
219000 [theme song]
21900e Hmm, let's see. Asparagus. Excuse me, um, I think you just stepped in front of me? Excuse me, I think you made a mistake? You see I was actually here first and—
219078 Sorry, didn't notice you there.
21900e I know.
21915e [chuckles]
21900e Oh, pardon me, sir—
21915e Yes, what?
21900e I think you just cut in front of me.
21915e A cut of celery? But— this is the asparagus stand!
21900e I said [into ear trumpet] I think you just cut in front of me.
21915e Ohoh, no need, dearie. I'm already in front!
21900e I noticed.
21915f [fades in] ...And I was like, 'Oh, wow.'
21900e Hey!
21915f Would you mind moving back? You're in my personal space.
21900e But—
219160 Seriously, do you need your asparagus so badly? Get a life.
21900e Oh, okay. There's no rush.
21900d Fluttershy, you mustn't let them treat you that way.
21900e Oh, it's-it's really no big deal...
219007 It's bigger than big. It's double big. You are a pony with a problem.
21900e What problem? Oh, go right ahead, Pinkie Pie. You first.
219007 Right there! That's the problem.
21900d You've got to stop being such a doormat.
21900e A doormat?
21900d A pushover, darling. You've got to stand up for yourself, promise us.
21900e Oh, okay. I promise. Oh! Good!
219000 [bit clinking]
21900e Oh, that's okay, I don't mind.
21900d Watch and learn. Hold it right there, Mister small and handsome.
219161 Uh, who, me?
21900d Oh, of course you. Nopony ever called you handsome before?
219161 Uhh, that'd be a big no.
21900d Oh, well, they should! How about flexing some of your muscles for me? [gasps] Oh, my heavens! Do you think a strong, handsome stallion such as yourself could give my friend the last asparagus?
219000 [bit clinking]
219161 [mumbles] Nuhh.
21900d See, that's not so hard, is it?
21900e Um... I guess not.
21900d Alright then! What else is on your list?
21900e Let's see... I also need tomatoes.
219000 [bit clinking]
21900e Here you go.
219162 [clears throat] That'll be two bits. Not one.
21900e Oh, but last week, it was only one bit.
219162 That was then, this is now.
21900e Oh, okay. I don't wanna argue about it.
219007 What do you think you're doing?
219162 Mindin' my own business, maybe you should try it.
219007 Two bits for tomatoes is outrageous. One bit is the right price.
219162 I say it's two bits.
219007 One bit.
219162 Two bits!
219007 One bit!
219162 Two bits!
219007 One bit!
219162 Two bits!
219007 Two bits!
219162 One bit!
219007 Two bits!
219162 One bit!
219007 I insist it's two bits or nothing!
219162 One bit and that's my final offer!
219007 Have it your way, one bit it is!
21901e [giggles]
219007 See? Asserting yourself can be fun!
21900e I guess you're right!
21900d So, Fluttershy, do you feel like giving it a try?
21900e Um... okay. [to self] I need that cherry. [to Crafty Crate] Boy, am I glad you have one cherry left. You see, I'm making this special meal for my bunny Angel. He's a very picky eater, and the recipe calls for a cherry on top.
219000 [bit clinking]
21900e Here you go.
219112 So, you say you need this cherry 'very badly'.
21900e Oh, yes, I'm desperate for it!
219112 Then it'll be ten bits!
21900e Ten?! Oh, hey, mister handsome, I know you wanna do the right thing because you're handsome and strong, and big, handsome, strong guys are always nice to everypony, right?
219112 Ten bits for the cherry.
21900e Ten bits for one cherry's outrageous! I insist on paying you... eleven bits!
219112 Eleven bits?
21900e Umm...I mean, nine bits!
219112 Er, now wait a minute.
21900e Okay, twelve bits, but that's my final offer!
219112 I think you're confused.
21900e It's twelve bits, take it or leave it.
219112 Okay, I'll take it!
219007 Don't give him your money! One cherry is not worth twelve bits!
21900e But... I was only doing what you did.
21900d It was a valiant effort, but you should refuse to give him your business and just walk away.
21900e But... I can't let Angel starve! He won't eat it unless I make it just right! I need that cherry no matter what it costs!
219112 In that case, twenty bits!
21900e Twenty?! Oh, but, I don't have that much!
219112 Then why're you wasting my time?
219098 I'll give you two bits for that cherry!
219112 Sold! Eh, tough break, kid. Next time, don't be such a doormat.
219163 [bleats]
21900e Ta-da! Here you go, Angel. Sorry there's no cherry on top, but the rest of it is exactly what you wanted. Angel? [yelp] [groan] Look at me... I really am a doormat. "The incredible Iron Will turns doormats into dynamos. Assertiveness seminar today, hedge maze center." As Celestia is my witness, I'm never gonna be a pushover again!
219000 [ponies chattering]
21900e Oh! Ah! Uh... excuse me! [squeaks]
219000 [kick]
219000 [thump]
219000 [music starts]
219163 [bleats]
219164 [bleats]
219000 [fireworks explode]
219000 [ponies cheering]
219165 [kissing] Welcome, friends! My name is Iron Will, and today is the first day of your new life! I wanna hear you stomp if you're tired of being a pushover!
219000 [ponies stomping and cheering]
219165 Stomp if you're tired of being a doormat!
219000 [ponies stomping and cheering]
219165 Stomp if you wanna pay nothing for this seminar!
219000 [ponies stomping and cheering, expressing confusion, then laughing]
219165 [snort] That's no joke, friends. Iron Will is so confident that you will be one hundred percent satisfied with Iron Will's assertiveness techniques, that if you are not one hundred percent satisfied, you. Pay. Nothing. But I pity the fool who doubts Iron Will's methods! You don't doubt me, do you?
219079 Uh-uh, no sir...
21900f [general agreement]
219165 That, my friends, is your first lesson. "Don't be shy; look 'em in the eye."
219000 [ponies chattering]
219165 Now, to demonstrate that Iron Will's techniques will work for anypony, I'm gonna need a volunteer.
219164 [bleats]
219163 [bleats]
219165 You in the back row!
21900e Who, me?
219165 Yes, you! Iron Will wants you onstage!
21900e [gulps] Uh, well...
219165 Now!
21900e [whispering] Okay.
219165 Whoaa! He's blocking your path. What are you gonna do about it?
21900e Um, politely walk around him?
219165 No.
21900e Gingerly tip-toe around him?
219165 No!
21900e Go back home and try again tomorrow?
219165 No! "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
21900e Oh! Sorry.
219165 Don't be sorry! Be assertive! "Never apologize when you can criticize." [clears throat] Why don't you watch where you're going!? Now, you try.
21900e Uh... next time, get out of the way before... I bump into you, 'cause... I totally won't be sorry when I do!
219000 [cha-ching]
219165 You see, my friends? If my techniques can work for this shy, little pony, then they can work for anypony!
219000 [crowd cheers]
21900e Okay, I feel good. I feel ready to "attack the day", as Iron Will says.
219000 [water spraying]
2190d7 [humming]
21900e Excuse me, Mr Greenhooves, but I-I think you might be over-watering my petunias...
2190d7 [chuckles]
21900e ...again.
2190d7 Let the professional handle it. [humming]
21900e "Treat me like a pushover, and you'll get the once over."
2190d7 Hm? Hmm... [coughs and sputters] Well, perhaps that is enough water.
21900e Thank you. [excited giggle] I can't believe it worked!
2190a7 Showpony business is tough.
219027 Go ahead, try one of your jokes out on me. I laugh at everything.
2190a7 Okay, okay, okay. A donkey and a mule are stuck on a desert island...
21900e [clears throat] Excuse me? Would you mind moving your carts so I can pass?
2190a7 Yeah yeah, in a minute, I just wanna finish up this story. And so the donkey says to the mule—
21900e A-hemmmm, can you move? You're blocking my path.
2190a7 Yeah yeah, in a minute! So the donkey says to the mule... [fades under] (Why don't we build a boat to get off this island? [laughs])
21900e "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
2190a7 ...and the mule says—
219000 [splat]
2190a7 Ugh! Easy does it, lady. We're moving, okay?
21900e Good!
219007 Who's next please? And what can I get for you today?
21900e What do you think you're doing?! Didn't you see me?
219023 Uh, I guess maybe.
21900e 'Maybe'? "Maybes are for babies!" [growling] Now go to the back of the line where you belong!
219000 [ponies gasp]
219007 Heyyy, look at you!
21900d Oh, your attitude is so feisty, it's fabulous.
219007 Looks like that monster's workshop really paid off!
21900e Iron Will's not a monster. He's a minotaur, and a true inspiration. His techniques really work.
21900d Well, they've certainly made a difference in the way you carry yourself. You truly are a whole new Fluttershy.
21900e Yes I am. And new Fluttershy feels pretty stoked about new Fluttershy.
219007 Well, old Pinkie Pie feels really proud of new Fluttershy. Proud as pink punch. Want some? [giggles]
21900e "You laugh at me, I wrath at you!"
219000 [crash]
21900e Bye, girls. What a day. Taxi! Oh no you don't. "Cut in line, I'll take what's mine!"
219000 [fight sounds]
219166 Aieeeeee! Ow...
21900e Nopony pushes new Fluttershy around! Nopony!
219007 Old Pinkie Pie is not so sure new Fluttershy is such a good idea after all.
21900d Old Rarity agrees.
21900e You got this, new Fluttershy! This day is yours! And nopony's gonna take it away from you! Am I right?! Right! What?! He's delivered the wrong mail, again!
219167 Oh—
21900e And new Fluttershy does not want the wrong mail delivered to her cottage.
219167 Ohh, did I mix 'em up again? Sorry about that.
21900e "You apologize, I penalize!"
219000 [crash]
219167 Oh!
219000 [stamp]
21900e [bites]
219110 Excuse me, do you know how to get to the Ponyville tower?
21900e [muffled] Sure, you just— [gasps]
219110 Oh, that's a shame.
21900e [growls] "You make me lose, I blow my fuse!"
219110 Hey!
219000 [bell ringing]
21900d Fluttershy! What are you doing?! That's no way to behave!
21900e Didn't you see what he did to new Fluttershy? And he thought new Fluttershy was a pushover!
21900d No, sweetie, he didn't. We saw the whole thing. We think that you've taken your assertiveness training a little too far.
21900e What?! You just want new Fluttershy to be a doormat like old Fluttershy! But old Fluttershy is gone!
219007 New Fluttershy? Old Fluttershy!?
21900d What happened to nice Fluttershy? We want that Fluttershy back.
21900e No, you want wimp Fluttershy. You want pushover Fluttershy. You want do-anything-to-her-and-she-won't-complain Fluttershy!
219007 Nyaaaaah! Too many Fluttershys to keep track of! Make it stop!
21900e Things getting too complicated for your simple little brain, Pinkie Pie?
21900d Now, stop right there! Let's not let things descend into petty insults!
21900e Why not? I thought 'petty' was what you're all about, Rarity. With your 'petty' concerns about fashion.
21900d [gasps]
219007 Hey, leave her alone! Fashion is her passion!
21900e Oh, and what are you passionate about? Birthday cake? Party hats? I can't believe that the two most frivolous ponies in Ponyville are trying to tell new Fluttershy how to live her life when they are throwing their own lives away on pointless pursuits that nopony else gives a flying feather about!
219007 [starts crying] Looks like nasty Fluttershy is here to stay!
21900d [starts crying] I cannot believe what that monster Iron Will has done to you!
21901e [crying]
21900e Iron Will's not a monster, he's a minotaur! [growls] [whimper] I'm the monster.
219000 [wind blows]
219000 [wolf howls]
21900d [knocks, clears throat] Fluttershy, are you in there?
219007 It's Pinkie Pie and Rarity!
21900e [muffled] Go away! Go away before nasty Fluttershy strikes again!
21900d Oh, sweetie, we all said things that we regret.
219007 We did?
21900d Shh.
21900e [muffled] Pinkie's right. I'm the only one to blame. [normal] But don't worry, I'm never coming out of my house again. Everypony will be a lot safer with me and my mean mouth locked away.
21900d [muffled] Sweetie, [normal] Pinkie Pie doesn't blame you, nor do I. You just received some bad advice from that Iron Will character.
219007 Yeah! He's the one that made you act super-duper nasty. What I mean is, there are other ways to assert yourself besides yelling at everypony.
21900d Yes! [muffled] You can stand up for yourself without being unpleasant about it.
21900e I-I'm not sure I can. I'm too far gone. Whenever I try to assert myself, I become a monster.
219000 [lightning strikes]
21900d Oh, sweetie, you're not a monster.
219007 No, but he is.
219165 Iron Will's my name, training ponies is my game.
219000 [pause]
21900d What a darling little catchphrase.
219165 Your friend Fluttershy loved Iron Will's catchphrases. Word on the street is that she doesn't take no guff from nopony! So, Iron Will is here to collect Iron Will's fee.
219007 Fluttershy is in no shape to deal with that creep!
21900d [gasps] I'm sure a big, brave, powerful, and rich monster— I mean, minotaur like you doesn't need that money right away. You can afford to come back later.
219165 Are you kidding? Fluttershy is overdue as it is. Iron Will collects now.
219000 [thud]
21900d Do something!
219000 [wood crunching]
219007 We're not even sure Fluttershy is home right now. Uh, she might be off frolicking with some woodland creatures. Uh, why don't you give us some time to track her down for ya?
219165 Iron Will does have some grocery shopping to do. Iron Will will come back this afternoon.
219007 But that's only half a day. We need one full day at least.
219165 Iron Will will delay for half a day and no longer!
219007 A full day!
219165 Half day!
219007 Full day!
219165 Half day!
219007 Half day!
219165 Full day!
219007 We need half a day and no more!
219165 Well, you'll get a full day and no less!
219007 Okie-dokie. See you tomorrow.
219165 Wait, what?
21900e [sneezes]
219165 Huh, sounds like the search won't be necessary. Iron Will collects now.
219007 But we had an agreement! You gotta come back tomorrow!
219165 "When somepony tries to block, show them that you rock!"
219007 [screams]
219000 [splash]
219007 [spits]
219164 [munching]
219000 [crunch]
219165 Your payment is overdue, Fluttershy! [knocks]
219000 [door opens]
219165 [snorts] You were nothing but a doormat, and Iron Will turned you into a lean, mean, assertive machine! Now, pay Iron Will what you owe Iron Will!
21900e Um, no.
219164 [munching]
219163 [bleats]
219165 What did you say?
21900e No.
219165 Ohhh, I'd hate to be you right now, because Iron Will is gonna rain down a world of hurt unless Iron Will gets his money pronto! [snorts]
21900e As I recall, during your workshop you promised one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed, or you pay nothing. Well, I'm not satisfied.
219165 What do you mean you're not satisfied?! Everypony has always been satisfied!
21900e Well, I guess I'm the first then. But since I'm not satisfied, I refuse to pay. It's as simple as that.
219000 [goats bleating]
219165 Ohh, are you... sure you're not just a little bit satisfied? B-because maybe... we could cut a deal. I-I mean we're both reasonable creatures, aren't we?
21900e I'm sorry, but no means no.
219165 No means no, huh? Nopony's ever said that to me before. Huh... I gotta remember that one. That's a good catchphrase for my next workshop.
219000 [goat bleating]
219007 You were amazing, Fluttershy! You totally stood up to that monster!
21900d In fact, you didn't change at all! You were the same old Fluttershy that we've always loved!
219007 The one we missed!
21900e Don't worry, old Fluttershy's back for good. I'm sorry I took the whole assertiveness thing too far. Friends?
21901e Friends.
219168 [laughing]
21900e Dear Princess Celestia,
21900e Sometimes it can be hard for a shy pony like me to stand up for myself, and when I first tried it, I didn't like the pony I became. But I've learned that standing up for yourself isn't the same as changing who you are. Now I know how to put my hoof down without being unpleasant or mean.
219000 [music]
219000 [credits]
220005 [sighs] I made it for you, Rarity. Why, yes, it is an ice cream house. Chocolate fudge shingles... rocky road garage...
220000 [hoof-steps echoing]
220005 Huh? Twilight?
220003 Oh. Hi, Spike.
220005 It's the middle of the night! Why are you pacing like this?
220003 Frankly, I don't know how you can sleep at a time like this!
220005 Three A.M.?
220003 It's awful, it's horrible, it's tragic!
220005 Eh... I don't understand. What's wrong?
220003 Here. Now do you see what's wrong?
220005 We forgot to celebrate Arbor Day?
220003 No, the problem is I just finished planning my schedule for the month, but I forgot to leave time to plan for next month! Don't you see? There's no time in my schedule to put together another schedule! I could move my meeting with the Ponyville Hay Board to the following Tuesday, but then I have to reschedule my lunch with Pinkie Pie, and you know what a nightmare she is with scheduling. This is an absolute disaster. My whole year could be thrown off!
220005 And I woke up from an ice cream dream for this...
220000 [theme song]
220000 [rooster crows]
220003 Oh, my gosh, I think I did it! If I can find a way to read "The Art of Invisibility Spells" and "Thornhoof's Brief History of Canterlot" at the same time, that could leave me a half-hour scheduling window! Huh?
220000 [magic crackling, wind blowing]
220003 What's going on? [yelps]
220169 Twilight, you've got to listen to me!
220003 Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
220169 Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!
220003 You're from the future?!
220169 That's right, now listen–
220003 What happened to you? The future must be awful.
220169 Please! I don't have much time!
220003 Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
220169 Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
220003 I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?
220169 The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not–
220003 Really? Where? I've never seen them.
220169 They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to–
220003 Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions– [muffled voice]
220169 I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't–
220000 [magic crackling]
220003 Future Twilight? Oh no! What was she trying to warn me about? Her clothes, her mane, that scar... Oh, what a mess she is! ...I mean, I am... or I will be... [gasps] She must want me to prevent whatever horrible thing happens in the future! [gasps]
220007 C'mon, Fluttershy! The party can't start until the party supplies get there!
22000e [grunts] Happy to... help... but... can I carry... the balloons next time?
220000 [crash]
22000e Oh!
220003 Listen, everypony! I've got something really important to say!
22000f [laughing]
220003 This is no laughing matter! We have a crisis on our hooves!
22000f [gasping]
220003 I've just been visited by myself from the future!
22000f [laughing]
220003 This isn't a joke! My future self tried to warn me about a horrible disaster that's going to occur sometime before next Tuesday morning!
220008 What kind of disaster?
220003 I don't know! I got sucked back into the future before I could explain!
220007 Run for your liiiiiiiife!
22000d What ever should we do, Twilight? How do we stop the disaster if we don't know what it is?
220003 We'll just have to work together to make sure we're safe. Rainbow Dash, you and the other Pegasi spread out over Equestria, and look for any kind of problem that could lead to a disaster, and I mean anything.
22000c You got it!
220003 Everypony else–
220007 [screaming] Anypony else wanna panic with me? No? [resumes screaming]
220003 Everypony else, time to disaster-proof Equestria!
220000 [cement squelching]
220000 [screw squeaking]
220026 Eeyup.
220000 [splash]
220003 Done, and done, and done. Applejack, what about the Everfree Forest?
220008 The perimeter's clear.
220003 Great.
22000c And my team gave the all clear from Fillydelphia to Las Pegasus.
220003 Excellent. Well, we've done everything on the list, but still... Future Twilight looked like she'd been through a horrible ordeal. I just have this nagging feeling we should be looking for something bigger than loose bolts and leaky pipes.
220000 [Cerberus roaring]
220007 Okay, everypony, follow my lead. [screams]
22000f [screaming]
220005 What is that thing?!
220003 That's Cerberus! He's supposed to be guarding the gates of Tartarus. But if he's here, then all the ancient evil creatures that have been imprisoned there could escape and destroy Equestria!
220005 Destroy Equestria?!
220003 Yeah! Isn't it great? Hey, Cerberus! You look like you could use some obedience training! Magic obedience training!
220000 [Cerberus roaring]
220003 Huh?
22000e Who's the cute widdle three-headed dog?
220003 Wow, I knew you were good with animals, but this is amazing!
22000e Aww, he's just a big furry guy who got out of his yard, that's all. Right, Cerberus? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
220007 [screaming]
220003 Pinkie.
220007 [stops screaming] Yes, Twilight?
220003 Do you have a ball I can borrow?
220007 I have balls stashed all over Ponyville, in case of ball emergency.
220003 [sing-song voice] Hey, Cerberus! Look what I have!
220000 [Cerberus panting]
220003 I'll be back as soon as I've returned him to the gates of Tartarus. Once he's back at home, there'll be no disaster.
220000 [rooster crowing]
220005 [yawns] I wish Twilight would go on epic adventures more often. Best night's sleep I've had in weeks.
220000 [door opening and closing]
220005 Hey, Twilight. How'd it go with Cerberus?
220003 Great. I got him back before any of the evil creatures could escape.
220005 Hurrh... hu– [belches]
220003 [yelps] Oh no!
220005 What's the big deal, it's just a 'lost dog' flyer. I guess the Princess hasn't heard we found Cerberus yet.
220003 It's not that, it's this!
220005 A paper cut? Come on, Twilight, you really need to toughen up. Just clean it out and you'll be fine.
220003 The cut's in the exact same spot as the scar on future Twilight's cheek! We haven't changed the future at all! The disaster is still coming!
220003 If the disaster wasn't caused by Cerberus getting loose, then what could it possibly be?
220005 [laughs] I dunno, but maybe you ought to give the pacing a rest. You've worn a groove into the floor!
220003 I don't have time for another one of your lectures, Spike! This is serious!
220005 My lectures?
220003 I did everything I could think of to change the future. But it didn't work. So maybe it's not what I do... Maybe it's what I don't do!
220005 Huh?
220003 If I stand right here and don't move a muscle until next Tuesday, I can't possibly do whatever it is that future Twilight wanted to warn me not to do!
220005 Really? So... no matter what happens, you're not gonna move a muscle, huh? Then maybe you won't mind if I... eat an entire tub of ice cream!
220000 [ice cream splatting]
220005 Mmm! [muffled] So good! [eating noisily]
220003 [growls] [through gritted teeth] Spike, stop! Think of the stomach ache!
220005 [chuckles] Stomach ache, huh? That's future Spike's problem.
220000 [knocking]
22000c Hey, Twilight, another Pegasus just got back from Baltimare with an all-clear and– [laughs] What's going on? Aren't you gonna stop him?
220005 She sure isn't! In fact, she's not gonna move 'til next Tuesday! She thinks it'll prevent the disaster from happening!
22000c [laughs] Oh, this is too rich. [gasps] Hey, Twilight! There's a mouse right behind you!
22016a [laughing]
220005 Wait, wait, wait, let me try! Whoa-oa– [belches]
220000 [whoomph]
22000c Oh no!
220003 What happened?
220005 I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to! It was a total accident!
220003 Show me.
22000c Uhhh... I'm not so sure that's a–
220003 Show me! Oh no! This is the same mane cut as future Twilight!
22000c Y'know... it really doesn't look too bad...
220003 I don't care how it looks! It's just another sign that the future hasn't changed! Not doing anything didn't work either! Oh, I wish there was a way to know what was going to happen so I could stop it!
220005 You wanna see the future? I might know somepony who can help!
220003 What's this?
220005 It's Madame Pinkie's place.
220003 Madame Pinkie?
220007 [spookily] Come... Enter the chamber of Madame Pinkie Pie... For the answers you seek, let us consult the mystical orb of fate's destiny... [normal] Do you like my mystical orb of fate's destiny? I just got it. Cool, huh?
220003 Yeah, uh... best one I've seen.
220007 [spookily] Look deep into the crystal ball... for soon it will reveal all! Ah, yes, I see something... It is a vision of the future... I see... you, Twilight. You will get a really cool birthday present next year...
220003 Yes, and?
220007 That's it.
220003 Are you sure?
220007 Yep. Cool birthday present.
220003 Pinkie, I need your Pinkie Sense to tell me what the impending disaster is that future Twilight was trying to warn me about!
220007 Oh, my fortunetelling has nothing to do with my Pinkie Sense, silly. It's only good for vague and immediate events.
220000 [crack]
220007 Like that, see? Where did that even come from?
220007 Lalalalalalala, lalalala... Gosh, I haven't seen Twilight since the flowerpot incident. Hope she still isn't mad. Uhhhh...
220000 [papers rustling]
220003 Off by point zero two from yesterday. Carry the fifteen... Negative azimuth on the fourteenth moon...
220005 Hey Pinkie.
220007 Twilight's really serious about finding out about that cool birthday present, isn't she?
220005 Who cares? As long as I can keep eating ice cream. Sorry, future Spike.
220007 [to Twilight] Are... you okay?
220003 Ah, Pinkie, I'm glad you're here. Can you help me recalibrate the apertures on the nine-and-quarter catadioptric telescopes?
220007 Sure!
220003 So I was thinking, after I came to see Madame Pinkie and the flowerpot landed on my head—see the bandage? Just like the bandage from the future...
220007 Nice!
220003 I had an epiphany after that flowerpot. Doing things didn't work, not doing things didn't work, and I couldn't predict the future either, so I only had one other choice - monitor everything.
220007 Makes sense to me!
220003 That way no matter what happens in the future, I'll be ready! I thought I saw something last night in the Horsehead Nebula, but after staring at it for three straight hours, I realized—I was wrong!
220007 Three hours? But when did you sleep?
220003 Oh, I didn't sleep. I haven't slept since future Twilight was here. There are only three days left until next Tuesday, I can sleep all I want after that!
220005 You've been awake too long, Twilight.
220007 Yeah. Tuesday's not three days from now, Tuesday's tomorrow!
220003 [gasps] Pinkie, did you finish recalibrating the apertures on the nine-and-quarter-inch catadioptric telescopes?
220007 I have no idea!
220003 Ah! My eye!
220007 Don't worry, Twilight, I have eye patches stashed all over Ponyville, in case of eye patch emergency. There! Now you look like a pirate! A sleepy pirate, with a really weird mane cut.
220003 The eye patch...! Another sign! Nearly all the signs have come true! I haven't done a thing to prevent the catastrophe! If Tuesday's tomorrow, and the disaster happens by Tuesday morning, then there's only one solution. I'll just have to... stop time!
220000 [train chugging]
220003 [hushed] Okay, the Canterlot archives are right over there. Let's move!
220005 Uhh... I don't think we need to sneak around, Twilight. It's not illegal to walk around Canterlot.
220003 [hushed] Guard! C'mon, you guys! [exhales] That was close.
220005 I dunno why we have to wear these things, either.
220007 Aren't we wearing them for fun?
220003 [hushed] No, there's nothing fun about this!
220007 Oh... Are you sure?
220003 [hushed] Focus, guys! The only way to prevent this disaster is to stop time! Time spells are kept in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing, the most secure section of the archives. That's why we're sneaking around!
220007 Awesome! That sounds fun!
220003 [hushed] No, it's not fun!
220007 Aww.
220000 [rustling]
220000 [ripping sound]
220007 I still don't understand how sneaking into the archives is gonna help her find out about her birthday present.
220003 [hushed] The coast is clear. Now slowly lift me into the window so we can– AH!
220005 [sighs] Let's get this over with.
220000 [splat]
220003 [hushed] Okay, if my calculations are correct, the Star Swirl the Bearded wing should be right... here.
220005 Uh, Twilight?
220003 [hushed] What is it, Spike?
220005 Isn't this where we came in?
220007 Cool! Can we climb in the window again? That was super fun!
220003 I don't understand. It's supposed to be right here... How are we supposed to find it now?
220007 Maybe we should ask somepony in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing?
220000 [orchestral twang]
220000 [angelic choir]
220003 Huh. How'd I miss that? Look at all those priceless magic scrolls. There are more than I ever imagined!
220007 Twilight, the guard!
220003 [gasps] What do we do, what do we do?!
2200ac Hey, Twilight, haven't seen you in a while. Let me open that for ya.
220000 [gate squeaking]
220003 [chuckles nervously] Thanks!
220003 Oh no!
220000 [splat]
220005 Oof!
220007 Oh!
220003 Look! I look just like future Twilight... The last sign has come true!
220007 And that's bad, right?
220003 Come on! It's almost Tuesday morning! The disaster could happen at any moment!
220005 But how do we find the time-stopping spell? There must be a million scrolls here!
220003 I. Don't. Know!
220000 [birds singing]
220005 Twilight, it's over! It's officially Tuesday morning.
220003 Nnngh, no! Tuesday morning, the disaster! Incoming!
220005 I dunno, Twilight. I don't see any disasters. Looks like a pretty nice day.
220019 Good morning, Twilight. Love the new hairstyle. Well, happy Tuesday!
220003 Why isn't anypony surprised to see me sneaking around in here?! Is it possible there never was a disaster? That I've just been making myself frantic over nothing?!
220005 I don't get it. If future Twilight wasn't warning you about a disaster, then what was she trying to tell you?
220003 [giggles] I don't know. But I do know one thing. I look ridiculous.
220049 [laughing]
220005 Yeah, you do!
220003 And it's all because I couldn't stop worrying and let the future handle itself! Well, not anymore. From now on, I'm gonna solve problems as they come and stop worrying about every little thing.
220005 That's great! Does that mean there won't be any more late night pacing?
220003 No more late night pacing. If only I had learned this lesson a week ago, we wouldn't have had to go through all this.
220007 Twilight, Twilight, I found something! It doesn't stop time, but it lets you go back in time. It says you can go back once, and it only lasts for a few moments. Does that help?
220003 Pinkie, you're a genius!
220007 Woo-hoo!
220003 Now I can go back and tell past Twilight that she doesn't need to go berserk with worry about a disaster that's never gonna come!
220000 [magic crackling]
220003 Twilight, you've got to listen to me!
22016b Who are you? I mean, you're me, but I'm me too. How can there be two me's? It's not scientifically possible. You are not scientifically possible!
220003 Twilight, please! I have a very important message for you from the future!
22016b You're from the future?!
220003 That's right, now listen–
22016b What happened to you? The future must be awful.
220003 Please! I don't have much time!
22016b Is there some sort of epic pony war in the distant future or something?
220003 Actually, I'm from next Tuesday morning, but that's not important right now!
22016b I can't believe time travel is really possible! How did you, I mean, I figure it out?
220003 The time spells are in the Canterlot archives. But that's not–
22016b Really? Where? I've never seen them.
220003 They're in the Star Swirl the Bearded wing. Now, you have to listen to–
22016b Is time travel fun, or does it hurt? I have so many questions– [muffled voice]
220003 I have something extremely important to tell you about the future, and I only have a few seconds, so you've got to listen! Whatever you do, don't–
220000 [magic crackling]
220003 –waste your time... worrying... about... Ugh! I can't believe I just did that!
220007 Did you tell her about the cool birthday present?
220003 Remember last week when future Twilight came to warn me about something? That was me trying to warn myself not to worry so much! Now I'm gonna spend the next week freaking out about a disaster that doesn't even exist! Ugh...
220007 Ah, don't worry about it. It's past Twilight's problem now.
220003 [giggles] Huh, I guess you're right, Pinkie.
220005 [stomach growls] Ohhh... my stomach... I, I think it's all that ice cream... I thought the stomach ache would be future Spike's problem... but now I am future Spike. Ohh...
220054 [giggling]
220003 Come on, future Spike. Let's get you home.
220000 [music]
220000 [credits]
221000 [digging sounds]
221003 C'mon, Fluttershy, it'll be fun!
22100e There's nothing fun about dragons! Scary, yes! Fun, no!
221003 But Fluttershy, the great dragon migration happens only once in a generation! Do you really wanna pass up a chance like that?
22100e Now that you put it that way, yes!
221003 Aw, Fluttershy, we just don't want you to miss out.
22100e Miss out on what? Dragons? Big, scaly, fire-breathing dragons?
221003 Well... yeah!
22100e Thanks, but... no thanks!
22100c Look, Fluttershy, I watched that boring butterfly migration with you, so now it's your turn to watch the dragon migration with me! You owe me!
22100e I... said... no!
22100c Yeaagh! Ugh!
221003 [gasps]
22100e [high-pitched growling] [whimpers]
22100c Okay, I guess I'll let you off the hook this time.
221000 [theme song]
221003 [hushed] I don't see any dragons.
221008 [hushed] Me neither.
221007 Me neither neither.
22100c Shoot! You don't think we missed them, do you?
221003 [hushed] No, I don't think so. We're just a little early, and I'm glad we are. This way, we can watch every moment of the migration without bringing any unwanted attention to ourselves!
22100d Yoo-hoo! Well?
221000 [squeaking]
221000 [party horns]
22100d What do you think? Am I the toast of the trench or what?
221008 [hushed] You'll be toast alright, when the dragons see you parading around in that getup.
221003 [hushed] You look very nice, Rarity, but could you maybe look nice down here in the trench with us?
22100d Nice is an understatement. I look fabulous! Who says camouflage has to be drab?
221007 [hushed] Ahoy, maties! Dragons ho!
221012 Oooh... ahhhh!
221003 Wow, amazing!
22100c Pfft, pretty lame move. Is that all they've got?
221000 [dragon roaring]
221008 [hushed] What do ya think of that 'move', Rainbow Dash? Still think they're lame?
22100c [hushed] Uh, not so much. The word 'fierce' comes to mind.
22100d [hushed] And 'formidable'.
221007 [hushed] And 'super-duper scary'!
221005 Yeah. Us dragons are definitely a force to be reckoned with.
22100c [laughs] Yeah, right, Spike. That's one of the scariest aprons I've ever seen!
22116c [laughing]
221005 What's wrong with wearing an apron? You won't be laughing when you spill blueberries all over your scales— feathers. That's one tough stain!
22100c One tough stain against one lame dragon. [laughs]
22100d You leave him alone, Rainbow Dash! Spike's style is unique. He doesn't have to look like other dragons.
221003 Or act like them.
22100d My little Spikey-wikey is perfect the way he is.
221005 I don't act like other dragons?
221007 Oh, not even close!
221008 But why would you want to, Spike?
22100d Yes. You've got something those dreadfully fierce dragons can only dream of.
221005 What's that?
22100d The cutest widdle chubby cheeks! Ooooo!
221005 Cute?! Dragons aren't supposed to be cute! Right?
22100d Oh, sweetie, you are turning the most delightful shade of red. It is most becoming.
221005 Rrrgh!
22100d Oh, isn't he adorable when he waddles off in anger?
221005 Waddle?! Rrrrrggggh!
221005 What am I? Where am I from? Who am I supposed to be?
221003 Uuugh! I don't know! For the last time, Spike, you were given to me as an egg. I don't know who found you or where they found you.
221005 Seriously? That's all you know?
221003 I'm sorry, Spike.
221005 That doesn't tell me anything about who I am! I need answers! I feel like I'm... I'm looking at a complete stranger. Oh!
221003 Oh, Spike. Why don't we do some late-night research? See what we can find out.
221005 Really? You'd do that?
221003 Of course! I'm sure we can find something.
221003 Nothing. Nothing in this one either!
221005 Nothing at all about dragons? This is getting ridiculous!
221003 I know! It's hard to believe, but ponies know next to nothing about dragons. Apparently they're too rare and too scary to try to talk to or study!
221005 I wonder if dragons cry...
221003 Aw, Spike.
221005 It's okay, Twilight. I'm gonna discover who I am if it's the last thing I do!
22100d Yoo-hoo!
22100c Hey, guys!
221005 Waugh!
22100d Good morning!
22100c Ya wanna join us for breakfast?
221003 That sounds great. I'm famished.
221005 Count me out. I've gotta get an early start!
22100d An early start?
221005 Yes! I'm going on a quest of self-discovery! I need to learn what it means to be a dragon! And the only way I'm gonna do that is to join the dragon migration!
221050 What?!
22100c Spike, that's nonsense talk! I know that you're a dragon, but those dragons mean business! They're big, and tough, and scary...
221005 And I'm small, and meek... and I like to wear aprons. See? This is exactly why I need to spend time with them.
22100c All I'm saying is that you could get hurt.
22100d Darling, this time I really do have to agree with Rainbow Dash. I don't want those big, ugly, nasty dragons to hurt one little scale on your cutesy-wutesy head!
221005 I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind.
22100d Oh, uh, quick, do something! Stop him before it's too late!
221005 Ngh! Hey! Give it back!
221003 Hold it!
221005 Whoa!
22100c Aaagh!
221005 Really?
22100c Don't tell me you think he should go?
221003 Yes, Spike. I couldn't answer your questions. My books couldn't either. I understand why you want to look elsewhere. I truly believe you need to go on this quest. And we have no right to stop you.
22100d I suppose not.
22100c I still say you're nutty, but hey, I've done lots of nutty things.
22116d We know.
22100c [under her breath] Rrgh.
221003 Well then, I guess this is goodbye, Spike. We can't wait to hear about it when you return.
22100c Yeah, we hope your trip–
221003 Quest.
22100c –your quest answers some of your pesky "Who am I?" questions.
221005 Thanks, everypony. I know it will.
22100d Goodbye, Spikey-wikey!
22100c Go get 'em, big guy!
221003 We have faith in you!
22100d [through her grin] We're following him, right?
221003 [through her grin] Of course.
221000 [wind blowing]
221000 [rain pouring]
221000 [dragon roaring]
221000 [teacup clinking]
221005 Ugh!
221005 Nngh...
221000 [dragons roaring]
221005 [gulps]
221000 [distant shouting]
221005 Alright, teenage dragons! Now that's more my speed. And size.
221003 [sounds of exertion]
22100c I'm telling you, we'll never pass for a real dragon!
22100d Oh, pish-posh! This costume is fabulous, one of my finer creations.
221003 Shh! [hushed] We'll never pass if they hear three voices coming out of one dragon! Now come on, let's go!
221000 [dragons cheering]
221005 Um, excuse me? Uh, hi. I'm Spike.
22116e You sure your name is Spike and not Shrimp?!
221000 [dragons laughing]
221005 No, it's Spike! I'm not, I mean, I'm sure about that...
22116f You look more like a Peewee to me.
221000 [dragons laughing]
221170 Hey guys, c'mon, seriously. Leave him alone or he might fly away. That is, uh, if he had any wings! [laughs]
221000 [dragons laughing]
22116f You fly in on your mommy's back during the migration?
221005 Not exactly...
22116e No, no, can't you see baby Spike just hatched? I bet he still sucks his claw at night!
221005 No, I haven't sucked my claw in months!
221000 [dragons laughing]
221170 Well, if you weren't just hatched, how come we haven't seen you around before?
221005 Oh, well, y'see, I live in Ponyville and–
221170 Hahaha! Ponyville? That explains it! I knew there was something vaguely pony-ish about you! If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were part pony!
221005 Who, me? I'm not part pony! I'm all dragon, see? Raar!
221170 Or maybe you're a pony in a dragon costume.
221000 [dragons laughing]
22116e A pony in a dragon costume...! [laughs]
221003 [deep voice] Aheh... yeah... hilarious.
221005 Nnh, I am a real dragon!
221170 Oh, yeah? Prove it.
221005 Well... how?
221170 By acting like one! Who's up for a little belching contest?
221000 [dragons cheering]
221171 [belches]
22116e [belches]
22116f [belches]
221000 [dragons cheering]
22116f [coughs]
221170 You think you can beat that, Peewee?
221005 [gulps] [belches]
221172 Huh?
221170 From the desk of Princess Celestia. Dear Spike, please te– Ha! Get this, guys! Spike's pen-pals with a namby-pamby pony princess!
221000 [dragons laughing]
221003 [gasps] How can he just throw that away?! That letter could be something important!
22100c We can't worry about that now, Twilight. We're here to help Spike!
221003 I know, I know!
22100c [strained noise]
221003 There's no reason to disrespect Princess Celestia that way!
221170 Maybe tail wrestling is more your speed.
221005 Uh...
221172 Yeah!
221170 Ready... go!
221173 [sounds of exertion]
221170 The winner!
221000 [dragons cheering]
221005 Good old tail wrestling...
22100d We can't let little Spikey-wikey wrestle one of them! He'll get clobbered!
221003 Let's go! [deep voice] I challenge Spike to a tail wrestle!
221170 Who's this weirdo?
22116e I think he's Crackle's cousin.
221176 BWAAGH!
221170 Oh, that would explain it. Ready? Go!
221005 [sounds of exertion]
221170 Spike's the winner!
221000 [dragons cheering]
221170 Nice going, little Spike! Maybe you are a dragon after all!
221005 Yeah! Maybe I am!
22100d Rainbow Dash, I can't believe your silly plan actually worked. Ow.
221005 Alright, who's next?
221170 Getting a little cocky, huh? I like that. So how about you wrestle... him! Go!
221005 Whooooooooa!
221170 So, Spike, you haven't exactly proven yourself as a dragon yet, have you?
221005 But... I get an A for effort?
221170 Huh, maybe. Let's see how you do in this next contest.
221005 Whaaaaa! Oof! Wha! Oah! Oof!
221000 [dragons laughing]
221170 King of the hoard!
221000 [dragons cheering]
221005 This is my chance.
22116e [chuckling]
22100c Not so fast!
221003 Oof!
221000 [pinching noise]
22116f and Garble - Whoa!
221005 King of the ho- whoa! Oof! Uh! Nuh! Oof!
221170 Looks like this is another fail for you, little Spike. Can't wait to watch you fail at lava cannonball, too.
221005 [gulps]
221170 Whoever makes the biggest lava splash is the ultimate dragon! Geronimo!
221000 [splash]
221005 Nuh!
221003 [hushed] Spike's on his own this time.
221000 [dragons cheering]
22116f Cannonball!
221005 Guh!
221170 What's wrong, Spike? You afraid the lava will hurt your soft pony hide?
221000 [dragons laughing]
221005 [gulps] [screams]
221000 [thwack]
221172 Oooh...
221005 Ugh... was I... that bad?
221170 No, dude, that was awesome! No pony could live through a belly flop like that! [chuckles] You're one tough little dragon.
221172 [general approval]
221175 [snorts]
221170 Spike, by belly flopping so hard, you have proven yourself worthy. I hereby dub you 'rookie dragon', and will now perform the initiation ritual. Rrrrgh. [chuckles] Now let's party dragon style!
221000 [dragons cheering]
221000 [dragon roars]
221005 Man, was that a great party.
221170 Great? Huh, maybe by Ponyville standards. Stick with us, Spike. We still got plenty to teach you about being a dragon.
221005 I'm not going anywhere. The way I feel right now, I could hang out with you guys forever.
221050 Forever?!
221170 [sighs]
22100d Spikey-wikey is going to stay with these awful dragons? Forever?
221003 Oh no, this is terrible!
22100c I should've stopped him back at the library when I had the chance!
221003 No, Rainbow Dash, this is all my fault! I encouraged him to go!
221170 Y'know, Spike, I think you just might be ready for a real dragon raid.
221000 [dragons cheering]
221170 There's a nest full of phoenix eggs nearby, and we're gonna swipe 'em!
22116f Aren't you totally psyched to go on this raid?
221005 Oh yeah, I'm excited. I mean, I'm psyched.
221170 Alright then. Let's fly!
221005 Uh, sorry, guys! I guess I'll meet you back here at the crater! After the whole raid thing's over? We'll totally hang then! Whoahoa!
22100c Oh no, they took Spike! We've gotta go after them!
22100d [screams]
221003 [yelps] Rainbow Dash, stop! We can't fly!
22100d And you're ruining my fabulous costume!
22100c I'm sorry, but we gotta help Spike!
221003 Well, we're just gonna have to hoof it!
221170 Alright, Spike. Since you're our rookie dragon, you get to lure the parents away from the nest.
221005 Heh... lucky me...
221170 Well go on, then!
221005 Hey, Mr and Mrs Phoenix! I was hoping I could have a word with you? Um, I'd, um, like to ask you some questions actually...
221170 [hushed] We haven't got all day, Spike!
221005 Hey, you bird brains! Come and get me!
221000 [phoenix caws]
221005 [yelps]
221170 What the...
221000 [phoenix chicks chirping]
22116e The eggs have hatched.
22116f What do we do now?
221170 We take the hatchlings, of course!
221000 [phoenix chicks screeching]
221000 [phoenix chicks blowing raspberries]
221170 Get 'em!
221005 [continues yelping]
221000 [phoenix chicks screeching]
221170 Ohh... get them!
221000 [phoenixes screeching]
221170 [chuckles] Nnnghh...
221172 Ugh!
221170 Nnngh, they got away! I hate that!
221000 [crash]
221172 Oof!
221005 Huh, what have we got here? What happened?
221170 They got away! Hey! You stole an egg?
221005 Uh...
221170 Well, I guess the raid wasn't a total waste after all.
22116f and Fume - [cheering]
221170 Nice going, Spike.
22116f Well, what are you waiting for, Spike? Smash it!
221005 Smash the egg?
22116f Yeah!
22116e Yeah, throw it on the ground as hard as you can!
221172 Yeah! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it! Smash it!
221005 No! It's just a defenseless egg, like I was! And I'm not gonna let you hurt it!
221170 What did you say?
221005 I said no.
221170 No one says no to me. [growls]
22100c Nopony's gonna lay a claw on him!
221003 That's right!
22100d Fighting's not really my thing, I'm more into fashion, but I'll rip you to pieces if you touch one scale on his cute little head!
221000 [dragons laughing]
221170 Ooh, scary, hehe! Spike, are these namby-pamby ponies your friends?
221005 Yes, they are. And they're better friends than you could ever be. Now, if you don't back off, you'll see what us ponies do when confronted by a huge group of jerky dragons.
221170 Oh, yeah? [snorts] What's that?
221005 Run away!
221170 [growls]
221003 Nyuh!
221000 [crash]
221177 [yelps]
221005 Phew, that was a close one. Thanks, you guys.
221003 Of course. What are friends for?
221005 You're more than friends. You're my family.
22100d [squeaks]
221005 Dear Princess Celestia,
221005 Seeing the great dragon migration made me wonder what it meant to be a dragon. But now I realize that who I am is not the same as what I am. I may have been born a dragon, but Equestria and my pony friends have taught me how to be kind, loyal, and true! I'm proud to call Ponyville my home, and to have my pony friends as my family.
221005 Yours truly,
221005 Spike
221000 [egg cracking]
221000 [phoenix chick chirping]
221005 Aww. [chuckles] Hey, welcome to the family, Peewee! Stick with me. I've got plenty to teach you about being a pony.
221000 [music]
221000 [credits]
22200c Calling all Pegasus ponies! Meeting tonight!
222178 [reading] "Mandatory meeting for all Ponyville Pegasi."
22200c Library, tonight. Be cool or be mule. No offense.
22202d None taken.
22200c All right, go on in, find a seat. [groan] You too, Fluttershy. Come on, let's go.
222000 [theme song]
222000 [projector motor noise]
222000 [music]
222179 Every living thing depends on the life-giving nourishment of rainwater, and it is up to Cloudsdale to provide rain-filled clouds to every corner of Equestria. But how, one pony might ask, does Cloudsdale gather all this extra water? Tornado power! That's right, Pegasi-driven tornado power. A team of Pegasi combine their wing power to create a jumbo tornado powerful enough to pull water out of the local reservoir and funnel it all the way up to Cloudsdale. Remember, Pegasi, your jumbo tornado must reach a minimum of eight hundred wing power to lift that water up to Cloudsdale. So, the next time you're wondering "Where does all that extra rainwater come from?", just remem–
222000 [music stops]
222131 [confused chatter]
222005 Uh... intermission?
22200c So, here's the scoop. Cloudsdale has chosen our own highland reservoir as a source of the rainwater they need for all of Equestria. And you know what that means. It means it's up to Ponyville's Pegasi to bring that water up to Cloudsdale.
222131 [excited chatter]
22200c Not only that, but Spitfire, captain of the Wonderbolts, will be here to oversee the water transfer and record our top tornado windspeed. Now last year, Fillydelphia broke the windspeed record with a top speed of nine hundred and ten wing power. But I think we can do better. I think we can get a top speed over a thousand!
222131 [excited chatter]
22200c ...if each and every pony trains, and trains hard to get their wing power numbers up.
22217a [coughing]
22200c That coughing better be from a popcorn kernel, Thunderlane. Nopony's getting sick on my watch. So, are we gonna train hard?
222131 Yeah!
22200c Are we gonna be strong?
222131 Yeah!
22200c Are we gonna be fast?
222131 Yeah!
22200c Record-smashing fast?
22217b YEAH!
22200c Who's with me?
222131 Woo-hoo! [cheering]
22200c Fluttershy!
22200c Stretch those glutes, Flitter! Nice flexibility, Cloud Chaser. A... little too much flexibility, Blossomforth. Uh, somepony give Blossomforth a hoof. Let's see some faster trotting, Thunderlane! Good pace, Silverspeed! [blows whistle] Keep it up! We're gonna need all the wing power we can get to break that record!
22217b YEAH! [snorts]
22200c Good work, everypony! [under her breath] Everypony except Fluttershy.
22200c [knocking] Fluttershy? I know you're in there! You're avoiding tornado duty and I want to know why! Fluttershy, open–
22200e Achoo. Hi, Rainbow Dash. [coughs]
22200c Fluttershy, what happened to you?
22200e Oh, I [sniffs] I think I have [coughs] the pony pox. I'm sorry. I really, really wanted to come to training day today [cough], but this pony pox has really knocked me for a loop. Achoo. [coughs]
22200c Oh, you poor thing. You know, there's only one cure for pony pox.
22200e I know, plenty of bed–
222000 [splash]
22200e [yelps]
22200c Cold water! Those pony pox are clearing right up.
22200e Oh, y'know, all of a sudden, I'm, I'm starting to feel better. [nervous laugh] I'll just get out of these robes and– ow! Oh, my wing, oh, ow, it's hurt. I guess I can't fly after all–
22200c [blows whistle]
22200e [yelps]
22200c Messed up wing, huh? Stop horsing around, Fluttershy. We've got a lot of training to do. Come on now, what's going on?
22200e Well, y'see, uh, well... oh, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it! I can't fly!
22200c What are you talking about? Just last week you went into that wicked nose dive to save that falling baby bird right before it hit the ground!
22200e But that was different, that was an emergency! This whole tornado thing, it's more like a performance, and you know how I hate performing in front of others. Don't you remember flight camp? I couldn't gallop hard or fly fast, not with everypony looking at me!
22200c It wasn't that bad.
22200e You're right, Rainbow Dash, it wasn't bad. It was horrible!
22217c [gasping] [yelps]
22200e [voiceover] The other foals used to tease me, a lot!
2220f3 [chanting] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly! [continues echoing]
22200e I just can't risk that sort of humiliation again.
22200c Suck it up, Fluttershy! This is no time for– I mean, confidence or no confidence, I'm gonna need every Pegasus to break the record, including you. I need every ounce of wing power I can get.
22200e Oh, I-I don't think so, Rainbow Dash...
22200c [sighs] Thanks anyway.
22200e Wait. I'll do it.
22200c You will?
22200e I will.
22200c You're game?
22200e I'm game.
22200c Alright!
222000 [squeaking]
22217d What exactly does this machine do?
222003 This is an anemometer. It measures your accelerative velocity and translates it into wing power, thus gauging your cumulative H2O anti-gravitational potential. Any other questions?
222178 Yeah. [to Spike] What exactly does this machine do?
222005 It tells you how fast you're flying and how strong your wings are.
222131 [Oooh. Ok, yeah.]
222000 [cough]
222003 Is that you again, Thunderlane? Please, we need to have a germ-free environment.
22217a It wasn't me, it was Blossomforth.
22200c Don't worry, Twilight. Thunderlane's just cooking up an excuse to spend tornado day in bed. Why don't you get over here and be our first test flyer, Thunderlane?
22217e [coughs]
222003 We have 9.3 wing power.
222131 Wow! That's fast!
22217b YEAH!
22200c Not bad, not bad. [joints cracking]
222003 16.5 wing power!
222131 [cheering]
22200c Now listen up! If each of you can get your numbers up to at least 10.0 wing power by the end of the week, we'll no doubt set a new tornado speed record. We'll be number one!
222131 [cheering]
22200c Impressive. Fluttershy, your turn. [blows whistle]
22200e [deep breath]
22217f [laughing]
2220f3 [echoing] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly...
222003 [hushed] Tell her!
22200c [hushed] No, you tell her!
222003 [hushed] No, you!
22200c Um... great job, Fluttershy! You measured, uh, uh, .5.
222005 .5? Isn't that like... less than one?
222000 [bonk]
222005 Ow!
2220f3 [echoing] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly! [repeats] [demonic laughter]
22200e [crying]
22200c Fluttershy, wait! So some punks poked a little fun at you and you got stage fright, big deal. You aren't gonna go quit just because of that, are you?
22200e [crying] Yes!
22200c But I need you!
22200e I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just [between sobs] don't have the courage right now...
22200e [squeaks] [crying]
222000 [squirrel chittering]
22200e [sniffles] Oh, thank you, but I'm afraid a couple of little acorns won't solve my big flying problem.
222000 [duck quacking]
22200e I tried, but you should've seen those ponies laughing at me...
222000 [birds chirping]
22200e I know it's important to have confidence in myself...
222000 [badger squeaking]
22200e Yes, yes, I do remember. The river was swelling...
222000 [badger squeaking]
22200e ...and you were scared...
222000 [badger squeaking]
22200e ...yes, I did tell you to never give up... and to believe in yourself. You're right, my friends. I shouldn't give up. I will get my confidence up and show everypony that I am a good flyer! A great flyer!
222000 [animals cheering]
222040 [blows whistle]
222000 [crash]
222000 [splash]
222040 [blows whistle]
222000 [sucking noise]
222000 [crash]
222000 [animal noises]
222003 That's wonderful, Flitter. Much better than yesterday.
22200c This is crazy awesome! We're gonna smash that record!
222000 [squirrel chittering]
222005 What did he say?
222003 Do I look like I speak squirrel?
222005 What's that?
22200e 2.3? 2.3?! That has to be some kind of mistake! I worked so hard!
222003 Fluttershy, that's a huge improvement!
22200c You did awesome, Fluttershy.
22200e No, I didn't. I thought I'd gotten over my nerves, but they still got the best of me! There's no way I'll fly with 10.0 wing power tomorrow!
22200c So you won't fly with 10.0 wing power. Every bit counts!
22200e How would you feel if everypony else was flying with 10.0 wing power and you were flying with 2.5?
222005 Actually, it was only 2.3, and– ow!
22200c Well, uh... I'd feel... um...
22200e Exactly! Humiliated! [between sobs] I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, I just can't do it!
222005 It's okay, Rainbow Dash, you've still got plenty of wing power for your tornado. You'll be able to lift tons of water up to Cloudsdale!
22200c [sighs] If only there was a way to lift Fluttershy out of the dumps.
222000 [ponies cheering]
22200c Are we ready to do this?
222131 Yeah! [cheering]
222005 Look!
22200c Lazy Thunderlane! Where is he?! He's been trying to get out of tornado duty the whole time with his fake coughing and all. Rumble, where's your lazy brother?
222180 He's got the feather flu. He's down at Ponyville Hospital.
222005 But he's not the only one.
222003 Let's see, with those eight sick Pegasi out with the feather flu... [gasp] Oh no!
22200c Don't tell me we won't be able to break the windspeed record?
222003 No...
22200c Phew!
222003 ...You might not have enough wing power to create a tornado powerful enough to lift the water to Cloudsdale!
222005 Well, should we pack up?
22200c No. Of course not. Forget the record. Cloudsdale still needs water! Okay, everypony! Let's give it all we've got! On the sound of the horn, we take off!
222005 [inhales, blows horn]
222000 [wind howling]
222005 You think they're gonna make it to eight hundred wing power?
222003 I sure hope so! One hundred and fifty wing power. Two hundred and fifty wing power. Five hundred wing power!
222000 [water churning]
222003 Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
22200e Twilight!
222003 Fluttershy! What are you doing here?!
22200e I figured... if I couldn't help Rainbow Dash with the tornado... the least I could do was offer moral support!
222003 She could sure use it, considering eight Pegasi are sick with the feather flu!
22200e Oh no! That's terrible news!
222000 [water splashing]
222000 [crunch]
222131 Whoa! [etc.]
222000 [splash]
22200c Yaa– oof!
222003 Are you okay?
22200c [muffled] I'm fine!
222003 Oh, you were so close to the eight hundred wing power minimum! I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.
22200c Rbbbb– We've got to try again!
222003 But you've pushed your crew to their limit already!
22200c [yelps]
222003 If you break apart again, somepony could get hurt! You should quit, it's not safe!
22200c No! One more time! I've gotta know we gave it our all! If I'm going down, I'm going down flying! C'mon, ponies, let's make this happen!
222131 [cheering]
22217b YEAH!
222005 [blows horn]
222000 [wind howling]
222003 Okay, here we go... one hundred wing power! Two hundred! Five hundred!
22200c Stay in position! Flap those wings! Faster!
222003 Seven hundred! Seven hundred and fifty wing power!
222005 [yelps] They fell apart right after this!
22200e Oh, I'm too nervous to look!
22200c C'mon! Just a little harder! I can see the water trying to funnel through!
222003 Seven ninety five! We are so close! Fluttershy, they need you up there!
22200e I won't make a difference!
222003 You can make a difference!
22200e My measly 2.3 wing power is still too little!
222005 It's sticking at seven ninety five! I don't know if they've got any more in 'em!
222003 Do it for Equestria! Do it for Rainbow Dash! Do it for yourself!
22200e [gulps] [yelps]
222003 It's moving! She's doing it! Seven ninety eight! She surpassed her best wing power number!
2220f3 [echoing] Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly! [laughs]
22200e No!
222181 What was that?
222182 I think it was Fluttershy!
222000 [anemometer beeping]
222000 [splash]
222003 She did it! She did it! They all did it!
222005 [blows horn]
222131 [cheering]
22200c Whoa, girl, take it easy!
22200e Whuh, what? Did we do it?
22200c Yeah, we did it! You did it!
22212c Ah!
222178 Great job, Fluttershy, that was awesome!
22217d Yeah, we couldn't have done it without you.
22207c Nice job, Rainbow Dash. You may not have set a new record, but you showed a lot of guts.
22200c Thanks, but if you wanna talk guts, then you've gotta give it to my number one flyer, Fluttershy! Let's hear it for Fluttershy!
222131 [chanting] Fluttershy! Fluttershy! Fluttershy can really fly! [cheering]
22200e Dear Princess Celestia,
22200e Sometimes you can feel like what you have to offer is too little to make a difference, but today, I learned that everypony's contribution is important, no matter how small. If you just keep your head high, do your best, and believe in yourself, anything can happen.

223066 Can you believe Featherweight got his cutie mark? Featherweight! Before us!
223000 [foals cheering]
223036 Great cutie mark, Featherweight!
223035 [chuckles] Looking good!
223105 [sigh]
223066 I give up...
22300a I've got it! The answer to all our problems!
223066 The Foal Free Press? How's the school paper gonna get us our cutie marks?
22300a [inhales]
223009 Move your caboose!
22300a Uh-oh. That's Granny Smith. Gotta run!
223065 Maybe there's something to this newspaper idea.
223066 Guess it's worth a shot...
223000 [paper ripping]
223000 [bubbling]
223066 Apple Bloom. Your newspaper idea was nothing but a big bust.
223065 We tried everything, from papier-mâché to making birds' nests, and nothing worked.
22300a [laughs]
223066 What's so funny?
22300a What I meant was, we should write for the paper! We can get our cutie marks as journalists!
223105 [groan]
223000 [theme song]
22305b Okay, class, see you tomorrow! Oh, for those of you who want to join the newspaper staff, stay here, because we're meeting right now!
22300a Cutie marks in journalism!
223065 Such a good idea.
22305b Welcome, everypony. Now, as you know, our editor-in-chief graduated last year–
223066 Oh, oh, oh, ohohohoh!
22305b Yes?
223066 What's an editor-in-chief?
22305b Good question, Sweetie Belle. I like those reporter's instincts. The Foal Free Press is a student-run paper. I'm only involved as an adviser, so the editor-in-chief is the pony in charge, from choosing the stories to making sure it gets to press on time. Now, as I said, we have a new editor this year!
223000 [door opens]
223183 Diamond Tiara?!
22305c Hm.
22305b I'll leave you alone now to discuss everypony's assignments. Have fun!
223000 [door closes]
22305c Alright, listen up. The Foal Free Press is a joke.
223183 Huh?
22305c Nopony at this school takes it seriously. Well I, the editor-in-chief in charge, am going to deliver us to newfound glory!
223000 [pause]
22318a Yay!
22305c First things first. Where's the staff photographer? Get out there and document everything. I'll decide what's important.
223000 [door closes]
22305c The rest of you, I want hard-hitting news and interesting think pieces. No more Namby-Pamby stories like last year's editor.
22318b But Namby-Pamby was a great editor.
22305c Well, there's a new regime now, and I want juicy stories. The juicier, the better! Now get out there and report!
223065 Let's get out of here, girls. Maybe we can try packing boxes again.
223066 But this could be our last chance to earn our cutie marks! If we really are supposed to be journalists, isn't it worth a little grief?
223065 I guess you're right. We can take a little bit of Diamond Tiara for a lifetime of cutie marks.
223066 C'mon! Let's go get these marks!
223066 [voiceover] My first story's going to be an exclusive interview.
223065 [voiceover] I saw a brand new nest of baby birds the other day. I bet our readers would eat up a sweet story like that!
223000 [splat]
223000 [birds laughing]
22300a [voiceover] Granny Smith has all sorts of great stories! I reckon I'll do a piece on the history of Ponyville.
223000 [typewriter clicking]
223000 [ink squirting]
22305c I hope you've got something, because everything so far is unusable. "Baby Birds Born"? "Rarity's Hot New Hat"? "Ponyville - The Early Years"?! Ah! I don't know what you call this, but it sure isn't news!
223066 We just... thought...
22305c Get something else on my desk by the end of the day, and it better be juicy!
223065 Now what? Do you know what I had to do to get that story?
22300a Oh, you don't even wanna know what I had to sit through.
223000 [camera snapping]
223036 Oh! Get it off me, Snails!
223035 Eh, you get it off me, Snips?
223036 Aah! Stop it! You are making it worse! Nah! Oh, great.
223035 I'll get it. [grunt]
223036 Aah!
223035 Get it off! Get it off!
223066 [giggles] Hey, Featherweight, c'mere! [giggles] Take a few pictures of this, then meet me during lunch. Girls, I have our story.
2230fb "Snips and Snails in Bubblegum Veils! And that's when the biggest jokester in school really stuck his hoof in it – literally!"
22318c The Foal Free Press is usually just boring news and stuff.
22318d So funny!
223036 Our mothers always told us we'd end up in the papers someday.
223035 Yeah, and look! We finally got the gum out! [laughs]
22305c Your column is a sensation! I don't want you doing news anymore. I want more columns like this. Columns about ponies and their private lives, the things they do when they think they're alone. You three are my new gossip columnists! And I love the way you signed it! "Gabby Gums"... [sigh] That was a stroke of genius!
223066 We couldn't fit all of our names, so we decided to create one for all three of us.
22305c Well, I want more Gabby Gums! Nice work, girls.
223065 But we sure seem to have a gift for gossip.
223066 If we can write a few more of these Gabby Gums columns, we'll earn our cutie marks for sure!
223080 Woo-hoo!
223066 Scootaloo? Do you have anything?
223065 Nope.
223066 Apple Bloom?
22300a [sighs] Sorry.
223065 Let's face it, nothing very juicy happens at this school.
223039 [grunts]
223000 [thwack]
223066 We're doomed.
223000 [thud]
22300d Ohh, Sweetie Belle... Was she raised in a barn or something? [gasps] Oh, you really shouldn't be snooping, Rarity... Oh, but it's so much fun, Rarity. Hello... what's this? [giggles] "Gum on their bum!" [laughs] Too rich!
223066 Can you please keep it down with all the laughter? I'm trying to– hey!
22300d Bleh! I, I was just–
223066 Are you snooping through my saddlebag?
223000 [twang]
223066 How dare you!
22300d Oh, but this Gabby Gums column is so funny!
223066 You actually like the school paper?
22300d It's so much juicier than anything in the boring old Ponyville Express. Could I borrow this to show my friends?
223066 Your friends would wanna read the Foal Free Press?
22300d Oh, they'd just love Gabby Gums! Who is she, anyway? I've never heard of her before. Is she a new–
223066 We gave up too quickly, girls. Forget trying to squeeze stories out of this school. We need to expand!
223000 [camera snapping]
22300a We can find all kinds of great gossip out there in Ponyville!
223066 We'll need to tell Featherweight to start working overtime.
223065 Sweetie Belle, you're a genius!
22313c [screaming and crying]
22305c "Pound and Pumpkin Cake Trip to the Store Ends in Tears." Gabby Gums comes through again!
22318a [panting] The Ponyville news stand wants to carry the Foal Free Press! Ponies keep coming by and asking for it!
22305c Send 'em twenty copies, and if they run out of those, we'll send 'em twenty more! You three are doing a great job for this paper. Keep those columns coming!
223065 This is great!
223000 [typewriters clicking]
223000 [ink splashing]
22300d Oh, this is the life, isn't it, girls? The best hooficure I've ever had!
223008 [voice vibrating] You said it, ooh...
223005 [sighs] I don't know if I've ever been so relaxed.
22300c You guys!
223005 Aaah!
22300c The new Gabby Gums just came out! "The Great and Powerful Trixie's Secrets Revealed!"
22300d We already read that one, Rainbow Dash. Come on, relax, have a hooficure, it feels amazing.
22300c [swallows] Did you forget who you're talking to? The day I get a hooficure is the day I turn in my daredevil license. Besides, I haven't read this Gabby Gums yet.
223005 Well, do it quietly, will ya? [sigh] Some of us are trying to unwind!
223003 I like Gabby Gums too, but don't you think she can be a little mean?
223008 She's not mean, Twilight, she's a hoot!
223003 "Celestia Just Like Us"? Gabby Gums doesn't value anypony's privacy.
22300d Oh, lighten up, Twilight, it's nothing but harmless gossip!
223000 [splash]
223007 Yeah, Twilight, I mean listen to this one. "Mayor Not Naturally Gray!" The mayor in a mane-dyeing scandal? Who wouldn't wanna read that?
223003 I just can't help feeling sorry for the ponies featured in her columns. It's gotta be a little embarrassing.
22300c Are you kidding? Do you know how awesome it is to get your name in the paper?
22300d Rainbow, why don't you join me in one of these delicious hooficures?
22300c It's that good, huh? Well, maybe just one little hoof.
223000 [chords]
22300c [yelps] Forget it, I don't like ponies touching my hooves. Man... I'd love it if Gabby Gums did a story on me.
223005 She did one on me.
223012 What?!
223005 Aaaah!
22300a "Exclusive! Local Dragon Tells All! Spike opens up about Canterlot, naps, and his favorite jams!"
223065 It's our best column yet!
22305c More like your worst column yet! Gabby Gums didn't become the biggest thing in Ponyville with namby-pamby stories like this!
22300a [sighs] Yeah, she's right. This column is a little softer than our usual gossip.
223066 Were you guys feeling guilty about all the gossip too? Like... maybe we could be hurting other ponies' feelings?
22300a Yeah, I didn't wanna say anything because everypony loves Gabby Gums so much, but... I was sorta hoping we could start writing more stories like this one.
223065 Me too.
223066 If we're gonna get our cutie marks, we've got to give the ponies what they want.
223080 Awww...
223008 "Applejack Asleep on the Job!" Can y'all believe this?! And this one - "Big McIntosh – What's He Hiding?" Who the hay does this Gabby Gums think she is?!
223003 Listen to this one. "Twilight Sparkle - I Was a Canterlot Snob. A well-placed scaly source close to the prissy pony says Twilight Sparkle thinks Ponyville is nothing but muddy roads and low-class rubes." Spike!
223005 [yelps and belches]
223003 How could you say such a thing?
223005 Well, I didn't! Gabby Gums made that up! I never said anything like that!
22300d Everypony, please! She's just a harmless schoolpony engaged in a little harmless gossip. You're really making too big a deal out of this.
223003 But it's all lies! Gabby Gums prints whatever she wants! She doesn't care whose reputation she destroys! "Fluttershy Has Tail Extensions!" "Pinkie Pie is an Out-of-Control Party Animal!"
223007 What?! It's true! I do have a problem! [crying]
223003 Oh, look! According to this one, the Cakes are breaking up!
22302a We are?!
223000 [crash]
22300c [muffled] Well, my life is officially over. [normal] Gabby Gums has made it to Cloudsdale.
223003 "Rainbow Dash - Speed Demon or Super Softie?"?!
22300c I grabbed as many copies as I could, but it was too late! [crying] I'm a laughing stock!
223003 See, Rarity? Your so-called 'harmless gossip' can be very hurtful!
22300d Honestly, you ponies have no sense of humor. So she tweaks a few ponies every now and then. Maybe they deser– [gasps] I'll destroy her! "The Drama-Queen Diaries"... She's reprinted my diary! How could Gabby Gums possibly get access to my private diary?!
223003 We've got to put a stop to this once and for all! Sweetie Belle's on the newspaper staff. Maybe she knows who Gabby Gums is.
22300d [gasps] My sister would never associate with anyone as beastly as Gabby Gums! I resent you even suggesting such a thing, Twilight! Why, she's the most innocent, most lovely–
22300d –most evil pony in Equestria! How could my own sister steal my private diary? How could my own sister be... Gabby Gums?
22300d Et tu, Gabby Gums?!
223066 [gasps] You know?! How'd you find out?!
22300d The gilded pages of your betrayal!
223066 Oh, yeah.
22300d How could you do this to me?! You stole my secret diary and published it for all the world to read! Gossip can be a very hurtful thing. It is an invasion of privacy, just like when I snooped through your saddlebag. You didn't like that much, did you?
223066 No...
22300d What is important is that you understand how your column makes the ponies that you're writing about feel!
223066 I do understand, and we've all been feeling guilty, but we just want our cutie marks so badly!
22300d Do you really think that writing nasty things and making everypony feel horrible is your destiny?
223066 Well, when you put it that way...
22305c No! I won't let you quit!
223066 But the gossip we've been printing is hurting everypony's feelings!
22305c Feelings?! I don't care about feelings! Gabby Gums is my bread and butter, and I'm not gonna let you goody-two-horseshoes take that away from me!
223066 We're sorry, Diamond Tiara, but we've made our decision.
223065 Yeah, you can't force us to keep gossiping.
22305c When you see these... you may not want to quit after all.
223080 [gasp]
223000 [camera snapping]
22305c I told Featherweight to document everything...
223000 [camera snapping]
22305c ...And that's exactly what he did.
223065 [gasps] Gimme those!
22305c Sorry, girls, property of the Foal Free Press. And if Gabby Gums really does go into retirement, I'll need something to fill that empty column space. Now get out there and bring me more Gabby Gums!
223066 We'll find a way out of this, girls.
223065 Maybe Rainbow Dash will have a story for us. She's always good for some gossip.
22300a Rainbow Dash! Hey, Rainbow Dash!
22300c Well, if it isn't Gabby Gums!
223066 You heard too, huh?
22300c Are you kidding? Everypony in town knows it's you three.
223065 Don't suppose you'd let us write a column on you, huh?
22300c [grunts]
223000 [rain falling]
22300e [muffled crying]
223066 Oh, hi, Angel. Is Fluttershy home?
223000 [door slams]
223065 [muffled] Hey, what gives?
223005 A-ha! [muffled] Twilight thought you might try to show your faces around here, so she put up a force field.
22300a Aw, c'mon, Applejack! You're not mad at us too, are you?
223008 Eeyup.
22300a You're not even gonna talk to us?
223008 Nnope.
223026 You should be ashamed of yourself, humiliatin' your sister 'n' me like that. We don't wanna talk to any o' y'all right now so take your little gossip column and your embarrassing photographs and just go away!
223000 [doors and windows slam]
223066 We've ruined all of our friendships and we still don't have our cutie marks!
22300a This is the worst day ever!
223065 Oh yeah? Wait 'til tomorrow. Our most embarrassing moments are about to be published for everypony to laugh at.
22300a So what do we do?
223066 I don't know, but we're not leaving this clubhouse until we think of something!
223000 [birds singing]
22305c That's it, Gabby Gums is out of time. Run these instead. I want this paper on every street corner in Ponyville!
22318e Yes, ma'am!
223000 [door opens]
223066 Stop the presses!
22318e Uh... they haven't started yet.
223065 We have a Gabby Gums column!
22305c Hmph, you're lucky I'm nice.
223000 [typewriters clicking]
22305c This better not happen again, or else.
22305c [sighs] Well done, Diamond Tiara. You've averted yet another crisis with your amazing diplomatic skills. [gasps] "An Open Letter to Ponyville by Gabby Gums"?! What is this?! Ooh, they're not gonna get away with this! I'll publish those photos tomorrow! They messed with the wrong pony!
223066 To the citizens of Ponyville,
223066 For some time now, you've been reading this column to get the latest dirt and the hottest buzz. But this will be my final piece. We want to apologize for the pain and embarrassment we've caused.
22300a Y'see, I'm actually three little fillies - Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo.
223065 As the popularity of our column grew, we got swept up in the hype. We knew that what we were doing didn't feel quite right, but we ignored the guilt because everypony seemed to want to read what we were writing.
223066 From now on, we promise to respect everypony else's privacy, and we won't engage in hurtful gossip any more.
22300a All we can do is ask for your forgiveness, Ponyville.
22300a Signing off for the very last time,
22300a XOXO, Gabby Gums
22305b Well, staff, I guess I gave a little too much authority to a first-time editor. I'm sorry, Diamond Tiara, I have to strip you of your title. [thunk]
22305c [growls]
22305b And for the next editor of the Foal Free Press...
22305c [blows raspberry]
22305b ...here's your new editor-in-chief, Featherweight!
223183 [cheering]
22305c Ugh! Him? But what about me?!
22318e Here ya go! I've been promoted to staff photographer!

224007 Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. You've really outdone yourselves, Mr and Mrs Cake. This is sure to be the winning entry of this year's national dessert competition!
22402a Oh, thank you, Pinkie!
22402b And thanks for transporting it all the way to Canterlot for us.
224007 Absolutely! It's my honor and I–
224008 Uh, beg pardon, but could we maybe move things along? This here cake's a mite heavy. Right, Big McIntosh?
224026 [grunts] Eeyup...!
224007 Alrighty then, Big Mac! To the train depot! That's it, Big Mac, nice and slow. This is precious cargo you're carrying.
22402b Yes, it took months of planning and testing.
22402a I would hate for it to–
224026 [grunts]
22418f Fall!
224007 Don't worry, Mr and Mrs Cake. Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, a little pegassistance?
224007 I'll get it there safely, you'll see!
22402a Ahahah, oh... of course, Pinkie.
22402b We never doubted you.
224007 Twilight, can I see you a second?
224007 A nice protective spell as extra insurance. [laughs] Better safe than sorry. AJ, Rarity, one last thing?
224007 All right, everypony, we're in the home stretch here.
22402b [wheezing]
224007 See, Mr and Mrs Cake? I got it here without a hitch! Now all we have to do is get it... in?
224000 [theme song]
224000 [squeaking]
224000 [banging]
224007 [sigh] Thank you all for helping me get the cake safely on the dessert car.
224003 Thank you for inviting us all to go with you to Canterlot for the National Dessert Competition.
22400d I'm sure the festivities will be just lovely.
224008 Phooey on the festivities! I can't wait to try all those tasty treats!
224000 [slap]
224007 Well, the tastiest treat of all is sure to be the Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. All that rich creamy goodness of the marzipan, combined with the tart tanginess of the mascarpone, blended perfectly with the smooth, silky sweetness of the meringue. That's why I call the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness the "MMMM".
2240d4 MMMM.
224007 Exactly. It's the most delicious delectable delightful de-lovely cake in Equestria, and it's sure to win first prize.
224190 Zis is not so, for I, Gustave le Grand, do challenge your crude cake to a duel of delectable delicacies against my...
224012 [gasp]
224190 ...exceptionally Exquisite Éclairs! They will undoubtedly strike down all ze competition, winning first prize and crowning me le champion.
224191 Not a chance, le Grand.
224003 Donut Joe! What are you doing in Ponyville?
224191 Picking up the final all-important ingredient for my contest entry, Donutopia! And with these super-sprinkles, my donuts are going to dunk all the other lousy desserts, steal first prize, and make my donut shop famous forever! [laughs]
224192 Oh, Joe... [laughs] Your dippy donuts could never out-rival me. [laughs]
224007 Hello. What's your name?
224192 I am Mulia Mild. Behold, my Chocolate Mousse Moose. It will trample all your treats, be given first prize, and make me the greatest chef in Equestria.
224190 Madame Mild, you and your mousse moose are mistaken.
224191 Your frou-frou éclairs will never defeat my donuts!
224007 The Cakes' Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness is going to win!
224192 Your simple cake could never take my moose. [gasp]
224000 [train whistles]
224003 Well, it sure looks like we're in for a delicious competition tomorrow. Maybe we should all settle in for a good night's sleep.
224191 Hmph.
224192 Nyahh.
224190 Huh! [mumbles]
224000 [doors slam]
22400c [yawns] I gotta admit I'm pretty beat.
224008 Yeah, I'm gonna hit the hay myself.
224007 Wait! Didn't you hear those chefs? We have to protect "MMMM".
22400d MMMM?
224007 Mmm-hmmm. I know for super sure that "MMMM" is the best dessert in all of Equestria, and I know that they know it too.
22400c So...
224007 So... one of them is going to sabotage the Cakes' cake tonight! You have to help me stand guard!
224003 Pinkie... you're overreacting.
224008 Yeah, those chefs aren't going to do your cake any harm.
224007 But they are! I just know it.
22400c Fine! If you want to stand guard, go for it. We're going to bed.
224007 I'll show them. I'll stay up all night and protect you. Nothing and nopony will stop me from keeping you safe.
224007 Huh? Stop, you saboteur! I have you now! Wha? A-ha! Ahh?! Oh! Thank Celestia you're okay! But one of those bakers is mixing up something bad, so I'm not leaving you again no matter what.
224000 [blinds snap shut]
224007 Huh? Who turned out the moon? Don't go near that cake, thief!
224000 [galloping]
224007 Stop, thief!
224000 [clang]
224007 Oh, are you okay, thief? [growls] Huh... Overreacting, my hoof. I knew I was going to have to keep a close eye on you, and that's just what I'm gonna do. [snores]
224000 [rooster crows]
224007 [snores] Huh? What? [gasp] The cake! Oh, MMMM, you look mmmm-marvelous.
224003 Whoa!
224007 I know. I think some congratulations are in order for a job well done.
224003 Um, you better hold off on giving yourself an award just yet, Pinkie. Look.
224007 Look at what? Huh? [gasp]
224007 [screams]
224008 What is it?
22400c What happened?
224007 It's the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, it's been [crying] mutilated!
224000 [gasp]
224007 Now we just need to find out who done it.
224003 You mean, who did it.
224007 Exactly. Who did-done-dood it.
224003 Well, having read many mystery novels, I know that the only way to discover the culprit is to investigate.
224007 Exactly.
224000 [bubble pops]
224007 And as chief detective, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.
224008 Uh, you're investigatin'?
224007 Yes! And Twilight shall be my lowly assistant who asks silly questions with obvious answers.
224003 Fine, Pinkie. Should we start looking for clues?
224007 Perfect silly question, my dear Twilight, because the obvious answer is...
224003 Yes?
224007 No! 'Cause I know who did it.
224000 [gasp]
224003 Pinkie, how could you possibly know?
224007 How could I possibly not know? Clearly this dastardly deed was done by the baker who knew their dessert could not measure up to the mastery of the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness. I guess you feared your éclairs lacked flair, Gustave!
224000 [silent film music]
224007 Thus, destroying the cake and the Cakes' chance of winning the National Dessert Competition.
224003 But it makes no sense!
224007 What do you mean, lowly assistant?
224003 Well, first, if you were tied to the train tracks, how are you now here?
224007 Huh... Guess that isn't a totally silly question.
224003 And second, the cake hasn't been sliced. It's been bitten. Just look at the teeth marks!
224007 Hm... You're right, my fine fellow. Gustave le Grand is clearly in the clear, which means the "MMMM" was destroyed by another baker. A baker whose donuts are do-nots. That's right, it was Joe!
224000 [spy music]
224007 [voiceover] Or as he's known in the spy world, Mane. Con Mane.
224000 [giggles]
224000 [beeps]
224000 [spraying noise]
224000 [thud]
224000 [laser noise]
224007 Crushing the Cakes' chances to win!
224003 Pinkie! There is no laser beam security system! And Joe is not sleek, stealthy Con Mane! He's big, gruff, and messy!
224191 Hey!
22400d Although, you would look rather dapper in a tuxedo.
224007 Huh... You may be right, lowly assistant.
224003 May be?
224007 Now that I'm taking a closer look at these desserts, I see that one simply cannot look me in the eye.
224003 Pinkie... that moose is a mousse!
224007 Yes, and the mule behind the mousse panicked when she saw the mastery of the "MMMM".
224003 So you're saying that the culprit is...
224007 Mulia Mild!
224000 [flute and percussion sounds]
224000 [clang]
224000 [cutting sounds]
224007 Putting an end to the Cakes' dreams of taking first prize. Huh, I hope you're proud of yourself, Mulia.
224003 Pinkie, stop! This is ridiculous! Look at her!
224192 [whimper]
224007 [sigh] I guess you're right...
224003 Thank you!
224007 But I was so sure that it was one of the other bitter bakers that destroyed the "MMMM". That way, their delicious dessert would reign supreme. I mean, just look at Joe's Donutopia. It's a spectacular city of donutty delight, topped temptingly in sprinklicious sprinkles. And Gustave's éclairs look incredibly edible with glistening glaziness. But then there's Mulia Mild's Mousse Moose. [sighs] Why, this mouth-wateringly marvelous mousse moose tempts the taste buds with its silky-smooth yummy-nummy chocolatiness. So why did this criminal devour the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness while leaving this trio of tasty treats untouched?
224000 [munching sounds]
224000 [scream]
224007 [gasp] Now I have no idea who do-doned it!
224007 This mystery gets more mysterious every minute.
224003 Well, you have to stop the wild accusations and get to the truth. Everypony go back to your cars while we do a little investigating. Okay, Pinkie, in order to really solve this mystery, we're going to have to find clues. Now you were here at the scene of the crime all night.
224007 Huh! You're not accusing me, are you?
224003 No! But maybe you saw something that will help us.
224007 I saw a silhouette in the moonlight!
224003 Good... Let's retrace your steps.
224007 And then I chased the culprit down the train towards the caboose, but when I got there, he was gone.
224003 Hm... A-ha! Our first clue. I think I know who did it, Pinkie.
224007 Already?
224003 Yes, but I need more evidence to confirm. Tell me what happened next.
224007 I heard somepony else in the dessert car and chased them up to the engine...
224007 ...But, when I got there, all I saw was the conductor shoveling coal.
224003 The conductor, huh? [gasp] But that doesn't make any sense. What happened next, Pinkie?
224007 Well... I went back to the dessert car.
224003 Yes?
224007 The curtains mysteriously closed, all on their own.
224003 Interesting. Anything else?
224007 I heard hoofsteps, a loud thud...
224000 [thud]
224007 ...and then they were gone! When I opened the curtains, I saw that the portrait by the door was all crooked.
224003 Oh my, what is that?
224007 [growling]
224003 What next, Pinkie?
224007 That's it. I was here guarding the cake the rest of the night. I mean... I slept by the cake the rest of the night.
224003 And when you woke up, half the cake was gone?
224007 Exactly.
224003 By Jove, I think I've got it. Call everypony back. We have a cake culprit to catch.
224192 [stuttering] Why are we all here again?
224003 I bet you're wondering why you're all here again.
224191 She's good.
224003 We have discovered the true culprit of this cake carnage.
224190 But how?
224003 Well, you see, when committing a crime, it's crucial that one never leaves behind clues, especially an obvious clue like... this.
224000 [gasp]
224007 A-ha! A blue feather! I knew it was you, Gustave le Grand!
224003 Pinkie, Gustave doesn't have blue feathers.
224007 No, 'cause he's been dyeing them!
224003 No, Pinkie. Remember how when you chased the suspect to the caboose, they suddenly disappeared? That's because they flew away. But the thief did leave a little something behind, didn't you, Rainbow Dash?
22400c I-I don't even like cake!
224007 So Rainbow Dash did it! Case solved!
224003 Case not solved, because when we went to the engine, I saw the conductor's hat. And inside the hat was... this.
224007 So it was you! That pink hair came from your rainbow-colored mane!
22400c I don't have pink in my mane, Pinkie!
224007 So you're wearing a wig?
224000 [stretching noises]
22400c Ow! Cut it out!
224003 Pinkie, remember? You chased a pony to the engine, where you thought you saw the conductor shoveling coal, but that wasn't the conductor at all. It was... Fluttershy!
22400e [gasp] Oh my.
224007 You're goin' down, Fluttershy!
224003 Pinkie! But then another clue confounded my suspicions. You were guarding the cake when the curtains mysteriously closed. But that's no mystery, that's magic. But when the thief tried to make their great escape, they left a little addition to the portrait. Has anypony else noticed that Rarity is wearing her hair rather differently today?
22400d [gasp] What? Is it a crime to change one's style now and again? Why, I think it's a crime not to.
224003 Really?
22400d Fine, I'm guilty! [crying] I wear false eyelashes! Oh, and I took a bite of the cake.
22400e So did I.
22400c Aw nuts, so did I.
22400d You just made it sound so delectable.
22400e So tasty.
22400c And boy was it!
22400d I only meant to take a little, lady-like bite.
22400e And it was so good.
22400c Yeah, I just dove right in!
22400e But I'm really really sorry.
22400d Terribly sorry.
22400c Sorry, Pinkie.
224007 That's okay. At least this mystery is finally solved.
224003 But it isn't. We figured out who ate the Marzipan Mascarpone Meringue Madness, but we still don't know who devoured the other bakers' goods.
224007 You're right, Twilight. You know what we have to do?
224003 Well... Yes, I do. Do you?
224007 Look for clues! [sniffing] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
224003 Well, Pinkie. Did you find the devourer of the desserts?
224007 I most certainly did. It was none other than... the bakers!
224000 [gasp]
224007 First of all, Gustave has mousse in his moustache! And Joe has éclair in his hair! And Mulia has sprinkles in her wrinkles!
224003 What do you say, bakers?
224190 Oh, I am so sorry, Mulia, but Pinkie made your mousse moose sound... très magnifique.
224191 And Pinkie's description of your éclairs really did make 'em sound scrumptious.
224192 And the way she spoke of your Donutopia, ohh, was too delectable to resist.
224003 Well, everypony, we finally have the mystery solved.
224190 Yes, but now we don't have any desserts to enter into ze contest!
224007 I think we can fix that. Come on!
224007 Dear Princess Celestia,
224007 Today I learned that it is not good to jump to conclusions. You have to find out all the facts before saying somepony did something. If you don't, you could end up blaming somepony for something they never did. This could hurt their feelings, and it can make you look really foolish. So from now on, I will always make sure to get all the facts.
224007 How's that for a lesson, Princess Celestia?
224003 Care for a bite?
224007 I don't mind if I do.
224000 [munching sounds]
224007 Mmmmm.
224000 [laughter]
224000 [music]
224000 [credits]
22500d Ahh!
225000 [running footsteps]
22500d It is gorgeous out. Just gorgeous!
225000 [running footsteps]
225008 [slurp]
225000 [running footsteps]
225005 Twi... light! ...I... have... Lemme just... [deep breath] [belch]
225003 [reading] Dear Twilight, I am sure you are as excited as I am about the upcoming wedding in Canterlot. [to the others] Wedding? [reading] I will be presiding over the ceremony, but would very much like you and your friends to help with the preparations for this wonderful occasion. Fluttershy, I would like you and your songbird choir to provide the music.
22500e Oh my goodness! What an honor!
225003 Pinkie Pie, I can think of no one more qualified than you to host the reception.
225007 Hip, hip, hooray!
225003 Applejack, you will be in charge of the catering for the reception.
225008 Well, color me pleased as punch!
225003 Rainbow Dash–
22500c [yawn]
225003 ...I would very much appreciate it if you could perform a sonic rainboom as the bride and groom complete their "I do"'s.
22500c Yes!
225003 Rarity, you will be responsible for designing the dresses for the bride and her bridesmaids.
22500d Princess Celestia wants me to– [unintelligible] ...wedding dress? For a Canterlot wedding... I, ah, ooh, oooh!
225000 [thump]
225003 And as for you, Twilight, you will be playing the most important role of all - Making sure that everything goes as planned. See you all very soon. Yours, Princess Celestia. But... I don't understand. Who's getting married?
225005 Oh, wait! Uh, I was probably supposed to give you this one first.
225003 Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and... [gasp] My brother?!
225000 [theme song]
225008 Your brother's getting married? Congratulations, Twilight! That's great news!
225003 Yeah, great news. That I just got from a wedding invitation! Not from my brother, but from a piece of paper! Thanks a lot, Shining Armor. I mean, really, he couldn't tell me personally? [imitating Shining Armor] Hey, Twilight, just thought you should know I'm making a really big decision that changes everything. Oh, never mind, you'll hear about it when you get the invitation. [normal] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza? Who in the hoof is that?! [snort]
22500e Um, Twilight? Are you okay?
225003 Sorry, it's just that Shining Armor and I have always been so close. He's my B.B.B.F.F! ...Big Brother Best Friend Forever?
225025 Ohhh!
225003 Before I came here and learned the importance of friendship, Shining Armor was the only pony I ever really accepted as a friend.
225003 When I was just a filly, I found it rather silly
225003 To see how many other ponies I could meet
225003 I had my books to read, didn't know that I would ever need
225003 Other ponies to make my life complete
225003 But there was one colt that I cared for
225003 I knew he would be there for me
225003 My big brother best friend forever
225003 Like two peas in a pod, we did everything together
225003 He taught me how to fly a kite (Best friend forever!)
225003 We never had a single fight (We did everything together!)
225003 We shared our hopes, we shared our dreams
225003 I miss him more than I realized
225003 It seems...
225000 [Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity]
225000 Your big brother best friend forever
225000 Like two peas in a pod, you did everything together
225003 [Twilight Sparkle]
225003 And though he's oh so far away
225003 I hoped that he would stay
225003 My big brother best friend
225003 Forever...
225003 Forever...
225008 As one of your P.F.F.s... Pony Friends Forever...
225024 Ohhh!
225008 ...I wanna tell you that I think your brother sounds like a real good guy.
225003 He is pretty special. I mean, they don't let just anypony be captain of the Royal Guard.
22500d So let me get this straight. We're helping out with the wedding of not only a princess, but a captain of the Royal Guard?
225003 I guess we are.
22500d Ooh, ooh, oooh!
22506c [excited chattering]
22500c A sonic rainboom? At a wedding?! Can you say "best wedding ever"?!
225007 [gasp] [echoing] Best wedding ever!
225005 So you all get to help with the big fancy wedding, but I'm the one who gets to host the bachelor party! I have just one question. What's a bachelor party?
225018 [laughter]
225008 Why the long face, sugarcube?
225003 I'm just thinking about Shining Armor. Ever since I moved to Ponyville, we've been seeing each other less and less. And now that he's starting a new family with this "Princess Mi Amore Ca-whatshername", we'll probably never see each other.
225008 Come on, now. You're his sister. He'll always make time for you.
225003 Couldn't seem to make time to tell me he was getting married.
225007 We're here, we're here!
22500c Whoa, what's with all the guards?
22500d I'm sure they're just taking the necessary precautions. Royal weddings do bring out the strangest ponies.
225007 Aaaaaaaaa– [trumpet sound]
22500d Now, let's get going! We've got work to do!
225008 And you've got a big brother to go congratulate.
225003 Yeah. Congratulate. And then give him a piece of my mind.
225003 I've got something to say to you, mister.
225193 Twily! Ah, I've missed, you, kid. How was the train ride? I–
225003 How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married! I'm your sister, for pony's sake!
225193 It's not my fault! Princess Celestia has requested a major increase in security. Didn't you see all the guards at the train station?
225003 Yeah, there's a big wedding coming up. Maybe you heard about it?
225193 It has nothing to do with the wedding. A threat has been made against Canterlot. We don't know who's responsible for it, but Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection. This, you need to see.
225000 [pop]
225193 [gasps] The burden of keeping Canterlot safe and secure rests squarely on my shoulders. Staying focused on the task at hand has been my top priority.
225003 Okay, okay, I get it. You've got a really important job protecting all of Canterlot with a force field only you can conjure up. But still... how could you not tell me about something as big as your wedding? Am I not that important to you any more?
225193 Hey. You're my little sister. Of course you're important to me. But I'd understand if you didn't want to be my best mare now.
225003 You want me to be your best mare?
225193 Well... yeah.
225003 I'd be honored! But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know! When did you even meet this "Princess Mi Amore Cadenza"?
225193 Twily, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance, your old foalsitter.
225003 Cadance? As in the Cadance? As in the greatest foalsitter in all the history of foalsitters?!
225193 [chuckles] You tell me. She was your foalsitter.
225003 Ohmygoshohmygosh! Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever! She's beautiful, she's caring, she's kind...
2250ba I am so lucky to have you as my foalsitter!
225194 I'm the one who's lucky, Twilight.
2250ba [scoffs] You're a princess. I'm just a regular old unicorn.
225194 You are anything but a regular old unicorn.
225195 Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [laughing]
225197 I am going for a hooficure and that is that!
2250d5 You are not going–
225197 I am! I am!
2250d5 I've already paid for three this month!
225197 I... no! My girlfriends are all getting their hooves done! And you said that onl–
2250d5 Please, we've done this at least– Oh... [chuckle]
225197 Oh, sweetie. You just did that face...
225003 How many unicorns can just spread love wherever they go? I only know of one! And you're marrying her! [sing-song voice] You're marrying Cadance! You're marrying Cadance!
225198 I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
225003 Cadance! Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake!
225198 What are you doing?
225003 Cadance, it's me, Twilight!
225198 Uh-huh.
225193 I've gotta get back to my station, but Cadance will be checking in with all of you to see how things are going. I think I speak for both of us when I say we couldn't be more excited to have you here. Right, dear?
225198 Absolutely.
225193 Well, we'll let you get to it.
225008 Cake, check. Ice sculpture, check. Best darn bite-size apple fritter you ever tasted...
225003 Mmm. Check.
225005 [imitative voices] I do. Do you? I do! [kissing noises] [nervous laugh]
225008 Hiya, Princess!
225198 Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza.
225008 Hiya, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza. You come to check out what's on the menu for your big day?
225198 I have! [chewing] Delicious! I love-love-love them. [nervous laugh]
225008 Aw, shucks. Why don't you take a few to go? I know how you brides can be. So busy, you forget to get a little somethin' in your belly.
225000 [thud]
225003 [gasps]
225000 [door closes]
225003 Did... you see what she...
225003 Oh, you should have seen how she acted back there. I don't know when she changed, but she changed! [imitating Cadance] "Please, call me Princess Mi Amore Cadenza."
225198 Did I hear someone say my name?
22500d Your highness! Let me just start by saying what an honor it is to play a role in such a momentous occasion. [nervous laugh]
225198 [unenthusiastically] Uh-huh. Is my dress ready?
22500d [stammers] Yes, of course. Um, I've been working on it ever since I was given the assignment, and I think you'll be pleased with the results! Mmm!
225198 I was hoping for something with more beading and a longer train.
22500d Oh, yes, of course.
225198 And those should be a different color.
225004 I think they're lovely.
225199 Me too!
22519a I love them.
225198 Make them a different color.
225003 Gee, maybe her name should be "Princess Demandy-pants."
225000 [pop]
225007 Okay, let me see. We've been over the games... [rattles dice] ...the dances...
225000 [polka music]
225007 [gasps] I think this reception is gonna be perfect! Don't you?
225198 Perfect! ...If we were celebrating a six-year-old's birthday party.
225007 [gasps] Thank you!
22501a Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night.
225003 Bet I can guess what you're all thinking. Cadance is the absolute worst bride-to-be ever.
225005 [high voice] Who, me?
225008 Spike! That goes on the cake.
225005 [nervous laugh]
22500d Twilight, whatever are you talking about? Cadance is an absolute gem!
225003 Rarity, she was so demanding!
22500d Well, of course she is! Why shouldn't she expect the very best on her wedding day?
225003 Applejack, did you know that after she told you how much she just 'love-love-loved' your hors d'eouvres, she threw them in the trash?
225008 Aw, she was probably just trying to spare my feelin's.
225003 No, she was just being fake and totally insincere!
22500e She did raise her voice at one of my birds during rehearsal.
225003 See? Rude!
22500e But he was singing really off-key.
225000 [bird sings off-key]
225003 Pinkie Pie, you had to have noticed how Cadance treated–
22511b [kissing noises and laughing]
225003 Never mind. Rainbow Dash, you're with me, right?
22500c Sorry, Twi. Been too busy prepping for my sonic rainboom to pay much attention to the bride's bad attitude.
225003 [growls]
22500d The princess is about to get married. I'm sure any negative behavior she might be displaying is simply the result of nerves.
225000 [thump]
225003 And I'm sure it's the result of being an awful pony who doesn't deserve to even know Shining Armor, let alone marry him!
225008 Think maybe you're bein' just a tiny bit possessive of your brother?
225024 Uh-huh.
225003 I am not being possessive, and I am not taking it out on Cadance! You're all just too caught up in your wedding planning to notice that maybe there shouldn't even be a wedding!
225000 [knocking]
225193 Twily! Your big brother's looking pretty good, don't you think? Huh. Everything okay?
225003 We need to talk. I think you're making a big–
225198 [clears throat]
225193 Oh, uh, hi, sweetie.
225003 She sure has a way of sneaking up on people.
225198 Could I speak to you for a moment, dear?
225193 Better see what she wants.
225198 [muffled] Look, we need to talk.
225193 [muffled] I'm here to talk.
225198 [muffled] It's about your sister, okay?
225193 [muffled] I– look, look, she's okay–
225198 [muffled] Just... listen to me, (over Shining Armor) alright? No no–
225193 [muffled] I'm listening, I'm listening.
225198 [muffled] I thought I made it perfectly clear I didn't want you to wear that.
225193 This was my favorite uncle's.
225198 And?
225193 And I think I should wear it.
225198 Are you disagreeing with me?
225193 I guess I am– Ah!
225198 Oh, dear. Are you getting another one of your headaches?
225193 Gyah!
225198 Feeling better?
225193 [grunts] Mm-hmm.
225003 She isn't just unpleasant and rude. She's downright evil!
225193 Twilight!
225198 Let her go.
225193 Huh. It seemed like she had something else she wanted to tell me.
22501a Who goes there? Stay indoors, Twilight Sparkle.
225003 Shining Armor's in real trouble! You have to help–
225025 [chatter]
225003 Dresses? What are you–?
22500e Can you believe it? We're gonna be Princess Mi Amore Cadenza's new bridesmaids!
225003 New bridesmaids? What happened to her old bridesmaids?
225008 She didn't say. But she did tell us that she would love-love-love it if we'd fill in for them.
22500d Seeing as we've been working so hard and everything.
225008 And you had your doubts about her.
22500d Told you she was an absolute gem!
22500c You sure this is what I should wear? Doesn't seem all that aerodynamic.
22500d Hmm. I'll see what I can do.
2250eb [excited chatter and laughing]
225003 Looks like I really am on my own.
225000 [church organ music]
225019 Perfect, girls. No need to rush. Then of course, Cadance will enter.
225000 [Wagner's "Bridal Chorus" plays]
225019 I'll say a few words, and then we'll begin with the vows. Shining Armor, you'll get the ring from your best mare.
225005 [imitative voices] Do you? I do!
225193 Hey... has anypony seen Twilight?
225000 [doors open]
225003 I'm here! I'm not gonna stand next to her! And neither should you!
225193 I'm sorry, I... I don't know why she's acting like this.
225198 Maybe we should just ignore her.
225003 You have to listen to me!
22500e Oh, goodness! Are you okay?
225003 I'm fine.
225008 Ya sure about that?
225003 I've got something to say! She's evil!
225025 [concerned chattering]
22519b [chattering]
225003 She's been horrible to my friends, she's obviously done something to her bridesmaids, and if that wasn't enough, I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
225198 [crying] Why are you doing this to me?!
225003 Because you're evil! Evil! And if I don't stop you, you're gonna ruin my brother's life!
225193 You want to know why my eyes went all [bells jangling]? Nuh! Because ever since I started having to perform my protection spell, I've been getting terrible migraines. Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me!
225003 [inhales]
225193 And she decided to replace her bridesmaids because she found out the only reason they wanted to be in the wedding was so that they could meet Canterlot royalty! And if she hasn't been on her best behavior with your friends, it's because with me being so busy, she's had to make all the decisions about the wedding!
225003 I was just trying to–
225193 She's been completely stressed out because it's really important to her that our big day be perfect, something that obviously wasn't important to you! [gasps] Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go and comfort my bride. And you can forget about being my best mare. In fact, if I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.
225008 C'mon, y'all. Let's go check on the princess.
225003 I was–
225019 You have a lot to think about.
225000 [doors slam]
225003 Maybe I was being overprotective. I could've gained a sister. But instead... I just lost a brother.
225003 He was my big brother best friend
225003 Forever...
225003 And now, we'll never do anything
225003 Together...
225003 I'm sorry!
225198 You will be.

226000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
226003 "Princess Celestia cordially invites you to the wedding of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and..." [gasp] My brother?
226193 Twily! Ah, I've missed you, kid.
226003 How dare you not tell me in person that you were getting married!
226193 A threat has been made against Canterlot. Princess Celestia asked that I help provide additional protection.
226003 But I'm still pretty ticked you're marrying somepony I don't even know.
226193 Princess Mi Amore Cadenza is Cadance.
226003 Cadance is only the most amazing pony ever!
22619c I hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
226003 Cadance, it's me! Twilight!
22619c [uninterested] Uh-huh.
226193 And I think I should wear it.
22619c Are you disagreeing with me?
226003 She's evil! I saw her put a spell on my brother that made his eyes go all [bells jangling]!
226193 Cadance hasn't been casting spells on me. She's been using her magic to heal me! If I were you, I wouldn't show up to the wedding at all.
226003 I just lost a brother. I'm sorry!
22619c You will be.
226000 [theme song]
226003 [echoing] Hello? Is anyone there?
226000 [thud]
226000 [laughter]
226003 Where am I?
22619c The caves beneath Canterlot, once home to greedy unicorns who wanted to claim the gems that could be found inside. And now, your prison.
226003 Help! Help!
22619c [laughing] It's no use. No one can hear you. And no one will ever think to look for you, either. Most ponies have forgotten that these caves even exist, which is why they are the ideal place to keep the ones who try to interfere with my plans. [laughing]
226003 Plans? What plans?
22619c The plans I have for your brother, of course.
226003 Don't you dare do anything to my brother, you... you monster!
22619c Only way to stop me is to catch me! [laughing] Over here! [laughing] Nope, over here! [laughing]
226000 [glass breaking]
226198 No! Wait! Ugh! Please! Don't hurt me! Twilight, it's me! Please, you have to believe me. I've been imprisoned like you. The Cadance who brought you down here was an impostor.
226003 Likely story!
226198 Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake. Clap your hooves...
22619d ...and do a little shake.
226003 You remember me!
226198 Of course I do. How could I forget the filly I love to sit for the most?
22619c [laughing]
226003 We have to get out of here. We have to stop her!
22619c [laughing]
22619c [Queen Chrysalis]
22619c This day is going to be perfect
22619c The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small
22619c Everypony will gather 'round
22619c Say I look lovely in my gown
22619c What they don't know is that I have fooled them all!
226198 [Princess Cadance]
226198 This day was going to be perfect
226198 The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small
226198 But instead of having cake
226198 With all my friends to celebrate
226198 My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at all…
22619c [Queen Chrysalis]
22619c I could care less about the dress
22619c I won't partake in any cake
22619c Vows, well I'll be lying when I say
22619c That through any kind of weather
22619c I'll want us to be together
22619c The truth is I don't care for him at all
22619c No I do not love the groom
22619c In my heart there is no room
22619c But I still want him to be all mine
226198 [Princess Cadance]
226198 We must escape before it's too late
226198 Find a way to save the day
226198 Hope, I'll be lying if I say
226198 "I don't fear that I may lose him
226198 To one who wants to use him
226198 Not care for, love, and cherish him each day"
226198 For I oh so love the groom
226198 All my thoughts he does consume
226198 Oh, Shining Armor, I'll be there very soon
22619c [Queen Chrysalis]
22619c Finally the moment has arrived
22619c For me to be one lucky bride
226198 [Princess Cadance]
226198 Oh, the wedding we won't make
226198 He'll end up marrying a fake
226198 Shining Armor will be...
22619c ...mine, all mine. [evil laugh]
226000 [organ music]
226019 Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to witness the union of [muffled] Princess Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor.
226198 Oh, we're never going to save him.
226003 We will. We just have to find... There!
22619e You're not going anywhere.
226019 Princess Cadance and Shining Armor, it is my great pleasure to pronounce you–
226003 Stop!
226000 [ponies chattering]
22619c Ugh! Why does she have to be so possessive of her brother? [sobbing] Why does she have to ruin my special day?
226198 Because it's not your special day! It's mine!
226000 [ponies gasp]
22619c What? But how did you escape my bridesmaids?
22619e I want it!
22619c Hmph. Clever. But you're still too late.
226008 I-I don't understand. How can there be two of 'em?
226198 She's a changeling. She takes the form of somepony you love and gains power by feeding off your love for them.
226000 [flames roaring]
226000 [ponies gasp]
22619c [laughing] Right you are, Princess. And as queen of the changelings, it is up to me to find food for my subjects. Equestria has more love than any place I've ever encountered. My fellow changelings will be able to devour so much of it that we will gain more power than we have ever dreamed of!
226198 They'll never get the chance! Shining Armor's protection spell will keep them from ever even reaching us!
22619c [chuckling] Oh, I doubt that. Isn't that right, dear?
226193 Mm-hmm.
22619c Ah, ah, ah. Don't want to go back to the caves, now do you? Ever since I took your place, I've been feeding off Shining Armor's love for you. Every moment he grows weaker and so does his spell. Even now, my minions are chipping away at it.
22619f [laughing]
22619c [laughing] He may not be my husband, but he is under my total control now.
22619d [gasp]
22619c And, I'm sorry to say, unable to perform his duties as captain of the Royal Guard.
226198 Not my Shining Armor!
22619c Soon, my changeling army will break through. First, we take Canterlot. And then, all of Equestria!
226019 No. You won't. You may have made it impossible for Shining Armor to perform his spell, but now that you have so foolishly revealed your true self, I can protect my subjects from you!
22619c [grunting]
226000 [explosion]
226000 [crown clatters]
226000 [ponies gasp]
226003 Princess Celestia!
22619c Ah! Shining Armor's love for you is even stronger than I thought! Consuming it has made me even more powerful than Celestia!
226019 The Elements of Harmony. You must get to them and use their power to defeat the queen.
2261a0 Rarity!
22619c [laughing] You can run, but you can't hide!
22619f [laughing]
226000 [barrier breaking]
226003 Go, go!
22600c Looks like we're gonna have to do this the hard way. How did you...?
226003 They're changelings, remember?
2261a1 They're changelings, remember?
226003 Don't let them distract you. We have to get to the Elements of Harmony. They're our only hope.
226000 [various fighting sounds]
2261a2 [growls]
2261a3 [hisses]
226008 Okay, this is just gettin' weird. Real me! Real me!
226007 [laughing] Do me! Do me! Meh, I've seen better.
226000 [changelings buzzing]
226198 You won't get away with this! Twilight and her friends will–
226000 [doors open]
22619c You were saying? You do realize the reception's been cancelled, don't you? Go! Feed!
226000 [doors close]
22619c [laughing] It's funny, really. Twilight here was suspicious of my behavior all along. Too bad the rest of you were too caught up in your wedding planning to realize those suspicions were correct! [laughing]
226008 Sorry, Twi. We should've listened to you.
226003 It's not your fault. She fooled everypony.
22619c Hmm, I did, didn't I?
22619c This day has been just perfect
22619c The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small
22619c Everypony I'll soon control
22619c Every stallion, mare, and foal
22619c Who says a girl can't really have it all? [evil laugh]
226003 Quick! Go to him while you still have the chance!
226000 [electric sounds]
226193 Wha– where... huh? Is...is the wedding over?
22619c It's all over!
226003 Your spell! Perform your spell!
22619c [laughing] What good would that do? My changelings already roam free.
226193 No! My power is useless now. I don't have the strength to repel them.
226198 My love will give you strength.
22619c [chuckling] What a lovely but absolutely ridiculous sentiment.
226000 [magic twinkling and surging]
22619c Noooooo!
2261a4 [screaming]
226019 Don't worry about me. I'm fine. You have a real wedding to put together.
226198 [gulp]
226000 [birds chirping]
226000 [cymbals crashing]
226000 [birds whistling Wagner's "Bridal Chorus"]
226000 [doors open]
226003 Seriously, though. I get why the queen of the changelings wanted to be with you, but how did you get someone as amazing as Cadance to marry you?
226193 I told her she wouldn't just be gaining a husband. She'd be getting a pretty great sister, too.
226019 Mares and gentlecolts, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of the real Princess Mi Amore Cadenza–
226198 Princess Cadance is fine.
226019 Hm. The union of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor. The strength of their commitment is clear. The power of their love, undeniable. May we have the rings please? I now pronounce you mare and colt!
226000 [cheering]
226019 This is your victory as much as theirs. You persisted in the face of doubt, and your actions led to your being able to bring the real Princess Cadance back to us. Learning to trust your instincts is a valuable lesson to learn.
2261a5 [kissing]
226019 Rainbow Dash, that's your cue.
226000 [explosion]
22600c Best... wedding... ever!
226000 ["Love Is In Bloom" starting]
22601a Hello, everypony. Did I miss anything?
226007 [squee] Let's get this party started!
226003 [Twilight Sparkle]
226003 Love is in bloom
226003 A beautiful bride, a handsome groom,
226003 Two hearts becoming one
226003 A bond that cannot be undone because
226003 Love is in bloom
226003 A beautiful bride, a handsome groom
226003 I said love is in bloom
226003 You're starting a life and making room
226003 For us (For us, For us....)
226193 Twilight! None of this would've been possible without you, little sis. Love ya, Twily.
226003 Love you too, B.B.B.F.F.
226193 Ready to go?
226198 Oh! Almost forgot.
22600d IT'S MINE! Oof! Ahaha... ha.
226003 Now this was a great wedding.
226005 Oh, yeah? Just wait until you see what I have planned for the bachelor party! [laughing]

3011a6 News from Northern Equestria! Uh... Your Highness.
301019 Yes?
3011a6 I am simply to tell you that it has returned.
301019 [gasp] Find Princess Cadance and Shining Armor.
3011a7 Yes, Your Highness.
301019 My dearest Twilight, you must come to Canterlot at once.
301000 [theme song]
301003 [panicked breathing] Where are all my quills? Brbrbr. No, no, no, no, no... Ugh! I need the Magical Compendium volumes one through thirty-six! Where is it?!
301000 [thud]
301003 Flash cards! I should make some flash cards. Spike, I'm gonna need you to quiz me. On everything. Everything I've ever learned. Ever. That isn't going to be enough cards.
301005 Twilight, calm down. It's just a test.
301003 Just a test? Just a test!? Princess Celestia wants to give me some kind of exam, and you're trying to tell me to calm down because it's just a test?!
301005 Uh... yes.
301008 I'd say she's handling things pretty well, considerin'.
301003 Urgh!
301000 [explosion]
30101a Are you sure you don't want me to go as well?
301019 Yes. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor are already there. The others will be joining them soon.
30101a The Empire's magic is powerful. It cannot fall again, my sister.
301019 She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we'll know that she is that much closer to being ready.
301003 Ahem.
301019 Trust me, little sister.
301003 You wanted to see me? To give me a test? I brought my own quills and plenty of paper to show my work. Sorry, sorry!
301019 This is a different kind of test. The Crystal Empire has returned.
301003 The Crystal Empire? I'm sorry, I-I thought I'd studied. Ooh. I don't think there's anything in any of my books th–
301019 There wouldn't be. Few remember it ever existed at all. Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic. One thousand years ago, King Sombra, a unicorn whose heart was black as night, took over the Crystal Empire.
3011a8 [growls]
301000 [chains jangling]
301019 He was ultimately overthrown, turned to shadow, and banished to the ice of the arctic north.
3011a8 [roars]
301019 But not before he was able to put a curse upon the Empire. A curse that caused it to vanish into thin air. If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... Which is why I need your help finding a way to protect it.
301003 You want me to help protect an entire empire?
301019 It is, as I said, a different kind of test. But one I'm certain you will pass.
301003 How do I begin?
301019 By joining Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in the Crystal Empire.
301003 My brother is there?
301019 He is. And your Ponyville friends will join you there as well. I have every confidence you will succeed. And when you do, I'll know you are ready to move on to the next level of your studies.
301003 But what if I fail?
301019 You won't.
301003 But what if–
301019 You won't. But Twilight, in the end, it must be you and you alone who ultimately assists Princess Cadance and Shining Armor in doing what needs to be done to protect the Empire. Do you understand?
301003 Mm-hmm!
301019 Then go. There is no time to lose.
301005 Ah! Twilight! That was fast! Let me guess, you got a perfect score? A-minus? B-plus? [gasp] Twilight, did you... [quietly] fail?
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 I was prepared to do my best
301003 Thought I could handle any test
301003 For I can do so many tricks
301003 But I wasn't prepared for this
301003 Levitation would have been a breeze
301003 Facts and figures I recite with ease
301003 The square root of five hundred and forty-six is twenty-three point three six six six four two eight nine one zero nine.
3011a9 She is correct!
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 I could ace a quiz on friendship's bliss
301003 But I wasn't prepared for this
301003 Will I fail, or will I pass?
301003 I can't be sure...
301005 [Spike]
301005 She can't be sure...
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 My mind is sharp, my skills intact
301003 My heart is pure...
301005 [Spike]
301005 Her heart is pure...
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 Oh, I've taken my share of licks
301003 I've made it through the thin and thick
301003 But no I wasn't
301005 [Spike]
301005 Oh no, she wasn't
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 Oh no, I wasn't
301005 [Spike]
301005 Oh no, she wasn't
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 No I wasn't
301003 Prepared... for this!
301005 Uh, prepared for what exactly?
301008 Twilight! Uh, did you pass?
301007 Are we gonna celebrate your awesomeness with Princess Celestia?
301003 Not quite. We're going to the Crystal Empire!
30104d Huh?
30100c Crystal what?
301000 [train whistle]
301000 [strong wind blowing]
30100d Ha! And you all made fun of me for packing so many scarves.
301005 [grunts] I didn't say a word. Whoa! Hey! C'mere... [fades out]
301193 Twilight!
301003 Shining Armor?
301193 Twily! You made it! We'd better get moving. There are things out here we really don't want to run into after dark.
30100e [gulp] What kind of things?
301193 Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned.
301193 Something keeps trying to get in! We think it's the unicorn king who originally cursed the place.
301003 But Princess Celestia said I was being sent here to find a way to protect the Empire! If King Sombra can't get in, then it must already be protected.
301000 [howl]
30100e [gasp] Th-That's one of the things, isn't it?
301193 Guh. We have to get to the Crystal Empire! Now!
3011a8 [growls] [roars]
301003 Go, go!
301193 Almost there.
3011a8 [growls]
301003 [gasps for breath] Everypony okay?
3011aa [general agreement whilst gasping for breath]
301003 Oh, no! Shining Armor, your horn!
301000 [electric crackling]
301007 Sparkleriffic!
30100d It's gorgeous! Absolutely gorgeous! [mumbles incoherently] There are no words!
301008 Focus, Rarity. We're here to help Twilight, not admire the scenery.
30100c Eh, I don't see what the big deal is. Just looks like another old castle to me.
30100d A– p– guh! Another old...! Have you lost your mind? Look at the magni–
30101d [laughing]
30100d Very funny.
301003 Cadance!
301198 Ooh.
30119d Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [laughs]
301198 One of these days we need to get together when the fate of Equestria isn't hanging in the balance. [sighs]
301003 Are you okay?
301193 Cadance has been able to use her magic to spread love and light. That seems to be what is protecting it. But she hasn't slept, barely eats. I want to help her, but my protection spell has been countered by King Sombra.
301198 [breathes deeply] It's alright Shining Armor, I'm fine.
301193 She's not fine. She can't go on like this forever, and if her magic were to fade... Well, you saw what's out there waiting for that to happen.
301003 That's why we're here.
301008 Why we're all here.
3011aa Mm-hmm.
301193 Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies.
30100d Crystal Ponies?! Hahaha, there are Crystal Ponies?! Um, ahem. Please continue.
301193 But we have to believe one of them knows how we can protect the Empire without having to use Cadance's magic.
301003 A research paper!
301193 Huh?
301003 That must be part of my test – to gather information from the Crystal Ponies and deliver it to you! This is gonna be great! I love research papers!
30100c [sarcastically] Yeah, who doesn't?
301007 Oh-oh-oh! Lemme guess! Is it Spike? Nono, Fluttershy! Rarity?
301003 Don't worry, big brother. I am really good at this sort of thing.
301003 Are you sure? Absolutely sure?
3011ab I'm sorry. I wish I could help you. But I... can't seem to remember anything before King Sombra came to power. [flash] And I don't want to remember anything about the time he ruled over us. [shudders]
301003 King Sombra's spell must be why their coats aren't... crystally.
3011ab Have we really been gone a thousand years?
301003 Yes.
3011ab It feels like it was just yesterday.
301003 If you think of anything, even the smallest thing...
3011ab Of course.
301005 Well, that was a total bust.
301003 Maybe the others are having better luck.
30100c A way to protect the Empire! You know anything about it or what?
3011ac I wish I could help you. Really.
30100c Hold on! You gotta know something!
3011ac But... I don't have any information.
30100e Oh, um. Excuse me! Oh! Hello! Umm, I was just wondering. [deep breath] Oh, oh, that's okay, um, you all look really busy. [laughs nervously]
301007 Time to gather some intel!
3011ad It just feels like something is missing.
3011ae I know. It looks the same, but it doesn't feel the same.
301007 Because it isn't!
3011ad [gasps] A spy!
301007 [screams] A spy? How did they know? Ah! Must have noticed my night vision goggles. Ooh! Night vision-y!
301000 [clang]
30100d Hm-hm-hmmm. And when you flip your mane, it simply must create a rainbow of color. Oh! Wouldn't I look just magnificent? So sparkly! [titters]
30100c [sighs] I got nothing so far.
30100d Oh, me neither.
301007 [hushed] My cover has been blown. I repeat, my cover has been blown!
301003 Ooookay.
301008 Sorry, Twilight. These crystal ponies seem to have some kinda collective amnesia or somethin'. Only thing I was able to get out of 'em was somethin' about a library.
301003 [gasps] A library? Well, why didn't you say so?!
301008 Uh... thought I just did.
301000 [doors open]
301003 I just... I don't even know what to... There are no words.
3011af Ahem. May I help you?
301003 Yes. We're looking for a book.
3011af We have plenty of those.
301003 [in awe] You do. You really do.
301008 We're lookin' for a history book. Somethin' that might tell us how the Empire might've protected itself from danger back in the day.
3011af Yes. Of course. History, history... Ah, yes.
301012 [squee]
301000 [pause]
301003 Which is where, exactly?
3011af I... I can't seem to remember. I'm not sure I actually work here.
30100c Ugh.
301003 We'll just take a look around. I'm sure we can find it on our own.
3011af Let me know if you find anything.
301007 I like her!
301008 Uh, anyone else startin' to think this is a lost cause?
301003 No, no, no, no, no... Yes! "History of the Crystal Empire". I just hope it has the answers we need.
301003 A 'Crystal Faire'. According to this book, it was established by their first queen and became their most important tradition. The Faire was held every year to "renew the spirit of love and unity in the empire so they could protect it from harm". My friends and I could put it together. Everything we need to know is in the book!
301193 That sounds pretty promising.
301003 We'll get started right away. C'mon, Spike, we've got a Crystal Faire to put together!
301005 [grunting]
301000 [door opens]
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 Princess Cadance needs our help
301003 Her magic will not last forever
301003 I think we can do it
301003 But we need to work together
301003 We have to get this right
301003 Yes, we have to make them see
301003 We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
30100c [Rainbow Dash]
30100c It says that they liked jousting
30100d [Rarity]
30100d They flew a flag of many hues
301008 [Applejack]
301008 Made sweets of crystal berries
30100e [Fluttershy]
30100e They had a petting zoo with tiny ewes
30104d [All]
30104d Oh, we have to get this right
30104d Yes, we have to make them see
30104d We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
301007 [Pinkie Pie]
301007 There was a crystal flugelhorn
301007 That every pony liked to play
301003 [Twilight Sparkle]
301003 And the Crystal Kingdom anthem
301003 Can you learn it in a day?
30104d [All]
30104d Oh, we have to get this right
30104d Yes, we have to make them see
30104d We can save the Crystal Ponies with their history
301003 It looks amazing! I don't know how I could've done this without you! One last check to make sure everything is in place, and then the festivities can begin!
301008 What's this thing for?
301000 [thunk]
301003 The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block.
301008 Nice work, Twi. Think we're ready to get this faire up and runnin'.
301007 [draws deep breath] [blows flugelhorn] Flugelhorn! [takes deep breath]
301003 Hear ye, hear–
301007 [blows flugelhorn] Flugelhorn! [laughs nervously] My bad.
301003 Ahem. Hear ye, hear ye! Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armor do cordially invite you to attend the Crystal Faire!
3011b0 [chattering]
301008 Come on in, y'all. Got food and drinks thataway, games and crafts are thataway, Crystal Heart to the back near the Princess.
3011ad Did she say... Crystal Heart?
3011b0 [chattering]
30100c We totally nailed it, right? Must be feeling a lot of love and unity about now! Gonna have some grub, huh? What are you thinking? Crystal Empire berry pie? Maybe some crystal corn-on-the-cob!
301000 [clang]
30100c What is with these ponies?!
3011ab Seeing all of this, I feel like I'm starting to remember. Remember things from before the king.
3011ac Me too.
3011b1 [gasps] The Crystal Heart!
3011ac Do you think they really have it?
30100c Of course we have it! Can't have a Crystal Faire without the Crystal Heart, right?
3011af Of course you can't. The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the Empire can be protected! [gasps] I do work at the library!
30100c W-what's that about 'powering the heart'?
3011af I just can't believe you found it. King Sombra said he'd hidden it away where we would never see it again! I only hope it will still be as powerful after all these years...! Mm, funnel cake!
30100c [strangled sound]
301003 Why did you–
30100c I think we may have a problem...
301003 I didn't know it was an actual relic! The book didn't mention anything about the Crystal Ponies powering the Heart! There was a page missing... How did I not notice?!
301198 It's alright, Twilight.
301193 Twily...
301000 [howl]
3011a8 [growls]
301000 [To be continued...]

301000 [credits]
302000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
302003 You wanted to see me? To give me a test?
302019 The Crystal Empire has returned.
302003 You want me to help protect an entire empire?
302019 It must be you and you alone.
302000 [train whistle]
302003 But what if I fail?
302193 Let's just say the Empire... isn't the only thing that's returned.
302003 Go, go!
302007 Sparkleriffic!
302193 Well, with Cadance putting all her strength into keeping her spell going, and me trying to keep an eye on signs of trouble in the arctic, we haven't been able to gather much information from the Crystal Ponies.
30200d There are Crystal Ponies?!
3021ab I wish I could help you. But I... can't seem to remember anything before King Sombra came to power. [flash]
302003 "History of the Crystal Empire". The last page of the book mentioned a Crystal Heart as the Faire's centerpiece, so I used my magic to cut one out of a crystal block.
3021af The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so the light within them can power the Crystal Heart, so that the empire can be protected!
30200c I think we may have a problem...
302003 I didn't know it was an actual relic!
302198 It's alright, Twilight.
302193 Twily...
302000 [howl]
3021a8 [growls]
302000 [theme song]
3021a8 [laughing]
302193 The Empire is under attack.
302000 [shing]
3021a8 Arrgh!
302000 [fizzling]
302193 I have to find the Crystal Heart!
302003 No, you stay here with Cadance. She needs you, Shining Armor. I'll retrieve the Heart.
30200c Let's do this!
302003 I've been trying to figure out how I'm meant to pass Celestia's test. Retrieving the Crystal Heart must be it. But there is something else you can do.
30200c Name it.
302003 You and the rest of our friends have to keep the Faire going.
30200c What? With that thing moving into the Empire?
302003 The whole purpose of the Crystal Faire is to lift the spirits of the Crystal Ponies, so they can activate the Crystal Heart.
30200c Yeah, and?
302003 If the Crystal Ponies find out that King Sombra is trying to take over the Empire again, their spirits are gonna be anything but lifted. It won't matter if I find the Crystal Heart. They won't be able to make it work. You have to keep them happy here at the Faire.
30200c Keep the Faire going and the Crystal Ponies' spirits high. Done and done!
302193 Twily, be careful.
302003 I will.
302000 [growl]
302000 [clink]
3021ab [eating]
302000 [rustling]
30200c [whispering] Okay, here's... [becomes indistinct]
30200d Huuuuh? [pause] I... just found out they're offering face painting for the little ones. [laughs nervously] [whispers]
302005 [under his breath] Uh-huh. We can do that. Twilight's doing what?!
30200d He... really... loves getting his face painted. Haha.
30200c Who wants a flugelhorn?
302007 I want a flugelhorn!
30200c Who else wants a flugelhorn?
302007 [screaming] I want a flugelhorn!!
302005 [pants] Twilight, wait! I'm coming with you!
302003 You can't. I have to retrieve the Crystal Heart by myself.
302005 I know. I promise I won't lift a claw to help you.
302003 [sighs] Not a claw, Spike.
302005 Where are we going exactly?
302003 I think I might know where King Sombra hid the Crystal Heart.
302005 The castle?
302003 The king would've been counting on the fact that nopony would dare come looking for it here. They'd have been too afraid to even try.
302005 I hope you're right.
302003 You and me both.
302008 [whinnies]
30200c What are you lookin' at?! That's what I thought!
302008 [whispering] Uh, Rainbow Dash? We're supposed to be actin' like nothing's wrong.
30200c Exactly. [growls]
302008 [hushed] What I mean is, maybe you should let me keep the Crystal Ponies away from the fake Heart, while you show off your joustin' skills.
30200c Huh. Seeing my awesomeness does have a way of putting ponies into a pretty good mood.
302000 [ewes bleating]
30200c Come on, Knight Fluttershy.
30200e Huh?
30200c It's showtime.
302008 How are y'all feelin'? Havin' a good time?
3021ab The best I've had in over a thousand years!
302008 Well, that's good! Gotta renew that spirit of love and unity if you're gonna power up that Crystal Heart, right?
3021ab I sure would like to see it before the ceremony. It's been such a long time.
302008 Oh, I hear ya, but, uh... phew! Gettin' a little toasty out here. Bet you'd like to cool off with a little Crystal Empire nectar! Uh, you tried the Crystal Empire fritters yet? Made from a traditional Crystal Empire recipe! You're gonna love 'em! [loudly] Uh, I hear there's a joustin' match about to start! You don't wanna miss that! [hushed] Come on, Twilight... These Crystal Ponies are more curious than a cat!
302003 [panting, noises of exertion, sighs]
302005 [pants]
302003 It's gotta be here somewhere. It's just gotta be! Not a claw, Spike.
302005 Uh... [laughs nervously]
302003 Celestia's orders!
302019 [echoing] If the Empire is filled with hope and love, those things are reflected across all of Equestria. If hatred and fear take hold... [echoes out]
302003 Of course!
302005 [panting for breath] Argh! What? Did you find it?
302003 No. Because this isn't King Sombra's castle.
302005 Well, isn't this where he lived when he was in power?
302003 It is. But it didn't look like this. [grunting]
302005 Whoa. When did you learn to do that?
302003 That was a little trick Celestia taught me.
302005 [gulps] [nervous noise]
302003 You stay here.
302005 Huh, if you insist. [echoing] Can you see what's down there yet?
302003 [echoing] Not yet. I can't even tell how far down this goes!
302000 [squeaking noise]
302000 [distant clatter]
302003 Spike?
302005 [echoing] Yeah?
302003 [echoing] Can you see outside?
302000 [thunder rumbling]
3021a8 [growls] Yesss... Crystalsss...
302005 It's not good! Cadance's magic must be fading [echoing] faster than before!
302003 Ugh! Ow! [sounds of pain]
302005 [echoing] Twilight? Are you okay?
302003 Yes...
302000 [crunching]
302003 What in the... [thud] Stop... moving! [sounds of exertion]
302000 [door creaking]
302003 Spike, I think it's here! Huh?
302019 What are you doing here?
302003 I don't know! I opened the door and–
302019 And now you must go.
302003 Go where?
302019 Doesn't matter to me. You failed the test, Twilight!
302003 I don't understand! The test?
302019 Not only will you not move on to the next level of your studies, you won't continue your studies at all!
302003 I... You didn't say anything about no longer being your student if I failed!
302019 Didn't I?
302003 But... what do I do now?
3021a8 [laughing]
302003 [crying]
302005 [distant and muffled] Twilight! [closer] Twilight? Twilight! Twiliiiight! [quickly] I know you told me to stay up there, but you were down here for such a long time and you weren't answering and I got worried so I came down here and you were just staring at that wall and... I was calling your name, but I couldn't seem to get your attention, and– What were you looking at? I mean... it's just a wall. ...Ponyville? Well, how did I get... No! I don't wanna go! Please, Twilight, don't make me!
302000 [door slams]
302003 King Sombra's dark magic. A doorway that leads to your worst fear.
302005 We were home. You told me you didn't need me anymore. You were sending me away...
302003 A fear that will never come to pass. I'm never gonna send you away. And I'm not gonna fail my test!
302000 [door opens]
302005 What's in there?
302003 [sighs] Stairs. Lots and lots of stairs. [sighs] Maybe you should come with me this time.
302000 [thunder rumbling]
3021a8 [laughs]
3021b0 [cheering]
30200e [scared, nervous noises]
302000 [thunder rumbling]
302007 [flugelhorn fanfare]
30200e [shrieks] [screams]
3021b0 cheering]
3021b2 [off-screen] Bravo, Knight Rainbow Dash!
30200e [nervous exhale] [catching breath] Isn't there... somepony else who could... take over the jousting demonstration with you?
30200c [scoffs] The fate of an entire empire rests on us showing these ponies a good time. But, y'know, if that isn't important to you...
30200e [cries]
30200c [sigh] Okay, okay, I'll take it easy on you next time. But not too easy. I've got a reputation to maintain!
302000 [stone cracking]
302003 [panting]
302005 [panting] What if this is just more of his magic? He makes a door that leads to your worst nightmare. Why not a staircase that goes on forever?
302003 Hold on to me.
302005 Uh...
302003 [sounds of exertion] Whoa. Whoaaa! Yaaaah!
3021ad [shrieks]
3021ac [distressed cries]
3021b0 [scared indistinct chatter]
30200d [laughs nervously] Excuse me, pardon me... [hushed] I am running out of weaving materials for the traditional crafts booth! I just made a hat out of three pieces of hay and a drinking straw! I made it work. But still!
302008 We gotta do everything we can to keep this thing goin'. The Princess isn't lookin' so good. I can't imagine her magic is gonna last much longer. It's gonna be fine. These ponies are gonna power up that Crystal Heart when the time comes, and we won't be needin' her magic anyway.
302007 I sure hope that time comes soon! Even I can't keep this party going forever! [shrieks]
302000 [bonk]
3021b3 This isn't the Crystal Heart.
30200d [laughs nervously] Oh, of course it isn't. The real one is–
302008 On its way!
30200d [hushed] I was going to say 'being polished' to buy us some more time?
302008 Oops.
3021a8 [laughs]
3021b0 [distressed cries]
3021b4 It's... It's him!
3021a8 Crystal Heart...
302003 Whoooooahahaha! I actually studied gravity spells, thinking it might be on my test! Turns out I was prepared for this! Wooo-hooo! [laughs]
302000 [thud]
302000 [wind blowing]
3021a8 [growls] [laughs]
302000 [lightning strikes]
302003 The Heart... Where's the Crystal–
302005 Here! It rolled over to me when you dropped it!
302003 Don't move!
302005 [grunts]
302003 You can move, just not toward me! How could I have been so foolish? I was just so eager to get it! Then when I saw what was going on outside, I...
302005 You have to get out of there, Twilight! You have to be the one who brings the Heart to Princess Cadance! If you don't, you'll fail Celestia's test!
302003 King Sombra is already attacking the Empire. He could reach the Crystal Ponies at any moment... reach Princess Cadance, my brother, my friends. There may not be enough time for me to find a way to escape.
302000 [stone cracking]
302003 You have to be the one to bring the Crystal Heart to the Faire.
302005 Me? But Twilight–
302003 Go!
302005 But–
302003 Goooo!
302000 [crystals cracking]
3021b0 [indistinct worried chatter]
302008 Now, don't y'all worry your pretty little Crystal heads! The real Crystal Heart will be here any second!
30200d [hushed] I don't know if they believe you...
302008 [hushed] Don't know if I believe me...
302000 [electricity crackling]
3021b4 He's back! I can't take it! [shrieks] Ugh!
3021a8 Ahhhhhh...
3021b4 [shrieks] King Sombra...!
3021a8 My crystal slaves...
302005 Whoa! Huh! [spits fire] Yah! [nervous noise] Hey! Up here!
30200d Spike?
302005 I got the Crystal Heart!
3021a8 [growls] That is mine!
302000 [crystals cracking]
3021a8 [growls]
30200d [gasps] Spikey-wikey!
3021a8 Hah. Huh?
3021b0 [indistinct awe chatter]
3021b5 Behold! The Crystal Princess!
302000 [crunch]
302198 The Crystal Heart has returned. Use the light and love within you to ensure that King Sombra does not.
302000 [whirring noise]
3021a8 What? No... No! Stop!
302000 [whirring noise]
302000 [whoosh]
30200d Oooh! [giggles]
302000 [crystals cracking]
3021a8 [screams]
302000 [boom]
302000 [crowd cheering]
302005 [sighs]
302003 [sighs] Good job, Spike.
30200d I do so wish it was permanent. Did you see how my mane just absolutely sparkled?
302008 But... good things are better when they're a rarity.
30200d Aww. [laughs]
302193 Everything's gonna be okay. You've gotta stop saving my rump like this. It's starting to get embarrassing.
302003 Wasn't me who saved you in the end. It was Spike.
302193 It's just a test. Maybe she'll let you retake it.
302003 I don't think she's gonna give me a new test.
302005 [breathing heavily] [to himself] Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight...
302019 It's beautiful.
302003 I wish it had been me who ultimately made it so. But it wasn't.
302019 Twilight, as I understand it, Spike brought Princess Cadance the Crystal Heart because you weren't sure how quickly you could find a way to escape the tower. You weren't willing to risk the future of the citizens of the Crystal Empire in an effort to guarantee your own. Far better that I have a student who understands the meaning of self-sacrifice than one who only looks out for her own best interests.
302003 Does this mean...?
302005 She's totally gonna lose it! [breathes heavily] Keep it together, buddy... Gotta stay strong... for Twilight...!
302000 [thud]
302003 I passed!
302025 [cheers]
302003 Ooh.
30200d [Rarity]
30200d You were prepared to do your best
30200d Had what it takes to pass the test
30200d All those doubts you can dismiss
30200d Turns out you were
302472 [All except Twilight Sparkle]
302472 Prepared for this!
302008 [Applejack]
302008 You clearly have just what it takes
302007 [Pinkie Pie]
302007 To pass a test with such high stakes
30200e [Fluttershy]
30200e We knew for sure you would prevail
30200c [Rainbow Dash]
30200c Since when does Twilight Sparkle ever fail?
302472 [All except Twilight Sparkle]
302472 All those doubts that you can dismiss
302472 Trust yourself and you cannot miss
302000 [Applejack, Rarity, and Pinkie Pie]
302000 Turns out you were
302003 [Twilight Sparkle]
302003 Turns out I was
302000 [Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Spike]
302000 Turns out you were
302003 [Twilight Sparkle]
302003 Turns out I was
30200d [Rarity]
30200d Turns out you were
302472 [All except Twilight Sparkle]
302472 Prepared for this!
302005 [laughs nervously] Yeah, I knew everything was going to be fine. [sighs]
302000 [music]
302000 [credits]
303000 [stretching sounds]
303005 Try again, Twi, you can do it!
303003 Phew, this spell's a toughie. But I feel lucky this time! One, two...
303007 Hi!
303003 Nnnnnng! Pinkie, why'd you do that?!
303007 'Cause hugs are funneriffic, especially when you throw one around a friend. Whatcha doin'?
303003 Trying to turn that apple into an orange!
303005 But you kinda threw her aim off...
303007 Wheee! [giggles] What a cute orange birdie! Do me next, Twilight! Do me, do me!
303000 [doing]
303007 Ooooh, Rarity, wanna see Twilight turn me into an orange? It's gonna be funna-fun-fuuun!
30300d As fun as creating this haute couture ensemble that I just finished making? Delightful, non?
303007 [gasps] This is terrible!
30300d I admit it's perhaps not my finest work, but I–
303000 [honk]
303007 You had total-awesome-amazing fun and I missed out on it?! Neh! Wait! What if there's more awesome amazing fun with friends happening somewhere in Ponyville right now that I'm missing out on too?!
303005 We weren't going to turn her into an orange! I swear!
303000 [whipping noises]
303007 Hey, Rainbow Dash, whatcha doing?
30300c This punk cloud got so heavy it's making fog. Figure I'll thin this bad boy out so it floats back up.
303007 Oooh, fun! Wheeeeee! Gotta go!
30300c Uh, thanks, Pinkie...?
303007 Hey, Applejack! That looks like fun, can I join you? Wheee! Next time I'll pull you!
30300e [sipping tea]
303007 Fluttershy! [panting] There... you... are...! Doing... [deep breath] anything... [deep breath] fun?
30300e Not especially.
303007 Oh, good. Fun... is hard...! [sighs]
303000 [theme song]
30300e Feeling better, Pinkie?
303007 Abso-tutely-lutely! Thanks for letting me rest in your butterfly grove while I get my Pinkie strength back!
30300e What are friends for?
303007 That's just the thing! I've got so many wonderful friends having fun in every last corner of Ponyville, I can't figure out how to keep up with it all! It's driving me even more coco-loco than usual!
30300e I can promise to not do anything fun at all if that would help.
303007 You are such a good friend.
303008 There you are, Pinkie. Been lookin' everywhere for ya, girl.
30300c Hey, Pinkie. Got something fun planned this afternoon thought you might wanna know about.
303008 Heh. Well, I'll be an apple crisp. I'm here for the same reason.
303007 This is perfect! Everyone will now bring their fun to me. Ha, this'll solve everything! Why didn't I think of that?
30300c Actually, what I meant is after I'm done whipping up today's weather, I'll be chilling by the lake catching some rays. Wanna hang?
303007 I am so there. Wheee.
303008 And my family's havin' a barn-raisin' this afternoon at Sweet Apple Acres.
303007 And I'm also so there. Whee, whee.
30300c But... that's when I'll be at the swimming hole. Ah, well, doesn't matter. Whichever one you choose is okay with me.
303008 Me too.
303007 [gasps] Choose?
303003 One, two...
303000 [ribbit]
303003 Pinkie! What in the wide, wide world of Equestria are you doing now?
303007 Timing myself galloping back and forth between the swimming hole and Sweet Apple Acres. I'm trying to cut down my time so if Rainbow Dash dives off the swing, I can get to Sweet Apple Acres to help with the barn raising, and then be back in time to see Rainbow Dash hit the water after doing a double flip! [sigh] If I can cut my time by only twenty minutes, I'm good.
303003 [laughs] Oh, Pinkie. I'm afraid no matter how hard you try, the only way to pull something like that off is if there's more of you to go around.
303000 [clock ticking]
303000 [alarm clock going off]
303007 That's it, Twilight! The legend of the Mirror Pool!
303003 Legend of the who-what now? Pinkie! I'm familiar with loads of legends, and I never heard of–
303005 Does this mean practice is over?
303003 Of course not! Back to work.
303007 Seems like hardly anypony's been here in ages. I hope I'm remembering the rhymes right from my Nana Pinkie's story. "Where the brambles are thickest, there you will find a pond beyond the most twisted of vines!" [echoes] What was that?! Oh, I heard a voice! Oh. Hehe. It was me. Ouch! Ooh! Stop scratching me up, you brambles, and– Whoooaaa!
303000 [thuds, whacks, and honks,]
303007 [gasp] The Mirror Pool! [echoes] Oh, and there's that voice again! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Ah Pinkie, you have got to stop talking to yourself. Starting... now. "And into her own reflection she stared, uh, yearning for one whose reflection she shared, and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
3031b6 Wheee-heee!
303007 Wow, the legend is true. It really worked!
3031b6 [under] Fun, fun! [continues]
303007 Okay, wait. I promised not to talk to myself anymore. I should say something to her. Or... would that still be talking to myself? Excuse me, me? Can I have a word with you? Uh, I mean, me? Listen, I can see you're having lots of fun, but–
3031b6 Fun?! Did somebody say fun? Where?
303007 I did, over here!
3031b6 I thought someone said something about fun! Where is it? Over here? Over here? I don't see it! Where is it? Where is it?
303007 Whoa, calm yourself, Pinkie, there's loads of fun to be had in Ponyville with my girls! Trot on over back to Ponyville with me and I'll tell you all about 'em.
303007 ...And then there's Rarity. She's the one with all the fancy clothes and ribbons and stuff! I'm thinking she can make us all matching t-shirts that say 'Team Pinkie', and–
3031b6 Is this Ponyville? Where's the fun? Where's the fun?
303007 Uh, well, let's see, Applejack's having a barn raising at–
303000 [whoosh]
303007 It's that-away!
303000 [whoosh]
303007 Wait, come back! Don't forget to meet me back here to tell me everything about everything, like I was there myself! Because I'm you and, and you're me, and– Oh, my gosh! This is the greatest plan ever! [squee] Now, off to double my fun!
30300c [yawns]
303007 Let's rock this pool, ponies! [blows up inflatable] Whee!
303000 [splash]
303007 Coming in, Dashie? The water's great, it's totally wet and everything!
30300c I don't know... Cloud busting was tougher work than usual today. [yawns] I'm kind of exhausted.
303007 That's fine, you relax. At least we'll still be together!
30300c Glad you made it, Pinkie. I thought you maybe went to Applejack's, instead.
303007 I did.
30300c Oh. The barn up yet?
303007 I have no idea.
30300c But I thought you said you were just at Applejack's.
303007 Actually, I'm probably still on my way there now! Whee!
303000 [splash]
30300e Oh, Pinkie Pie, I'm so glad you wandered by. I know I promised not to have any fun today, but, oh, I couldn't help myself. All of my critter friends wanted a picnic, and I couldn't disappoint them. Come join us. We have plenty of hay juice and marmalade to go around, don't we, critters?
303000 [critters chatter in agreement]
303000 [mouse squeaks]
3031b6 [chomps] Wait, but that sounds super fun! Oh, but Applejohn sounds super fun too! Uh, and, and I can't do one without missing out on the other!
30300e Who's Applejohn?
3031b6 Two fun things at once? But which, which? Oh, can't decide... [breathes heavily] Trouble breathing... Walls closing in!
30300e Walls? But we're outside.
3031b6 [shrieks]
30300e Goodness. Was it something I said?
303000 [bear grunts]
3031b6 Yes!
30300e Huh?
303007 So you see, that's how I'm able to have fun in two places at once.
30300c Duplicates of you, huh? Heh, yeah, sure, Pinkie. [yawns] Look, I was just gearing up to catch some Z's, so, uh...
303007 Gotcha. I'll have the rest of my fun really quietly. [quietly] Wheeeee...
30300c How'd you do that?
303007 Just trying to show a little consideration for my sleepy friend. Ooh, ooh, gotta run. Looks like I'm trying to get my attention. Excuse me.
3031b6 And me.
303007 Ooh, ooh, tell me all about it! Did they pull the walls of the barn up slow or fast?
3031b6 I–
303007 Maybe slow to medium fast, somewhere in that range?
3031b6 I–
303007 Ooh, did you get ice cream? What kinds did they have? Banana brickle?
3031b6 I didn't make it! I was on my way there and then Fluttershutter–
303007 Fluttershy.
3031b6 Yeah, her. She offered something else fun for me to do! A picnic, with cute little animals!
303007 Aw, how could you say no to that?
3031b6 That's what I'm saying! Then I would've missed the super fun thing with Applesauce!
303007 Applejack.
3031b6 [bawling] So I didn't do anything fun at all!
303007 Aw, my poor poor me! There, there. Tell me what, we just need a couple more Pinkie Pies. Easy peasy.
3031b6 Really?
303007 Come on, would I lie to me?
3031b7 "...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
3031b6 Look, a double me!
303007 I think you mean a double-double me. Plus another double-double me, which makes two double-double mes, or a double-double-double me, if you will.
3031b6 [happy squeal]
3031b8 Did somebody say fun? Where? Fun fun fun fun fun!
3031b9 ["Fun! Fun! Fun!", laughter]
303007 Now Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy are covered, plus one extra Pinkie Pie in case we get an extra invite from somepony else. Perfect! Okay, let's go! [under] Hey, Pinkies! Yoo-hoo!
3031b9 "...and solemnly sweared not to be scared at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
303007 Okay, good enough. Pinkie Pies, move it out–
3031bb "...not to be scared, at the prospect of being doubly mared!"
303007 What in the name of pink?! Knock it off!
3031bb ["Fun! Fun! Fun!"]
303007 To Ponyville, everyone! Follow me!
303000 [pause]
303007 [sighs] Yes, it's fun there.
3031bb ["Fun! Fun! Fun!"]
3031bb ["Fun! Fun! Fun!", "Whee!"]
303007 [whistles] Okay, between the bunch of us, we should have every nook and cranny of fun in Ponyville covered at all times. An unprecedented and massive undertaking! But first, a pop quiz on the names I taught you!
3031bb [in chorus] Applejack! Fluttershy! Pinkie Pie!
303007 Excellent. Okay, let's get on with this, folks. Fan out on three. One–
303000 [whoosh]
303007 Eh, good enough. La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, whee!
3031bc [giggling]
30300c [sneezes] What the–
3031bb [shouting "Fun!", etc.]
30300c Wow! Pinkie Pie wasn't kidding about the duplicates! Except now there's triplicates... and quadruplicates!
303007 Dash is gonna love this! Aw, if I push her around on this floaty thing, it'll be fun and relaxing!
303000 [duplicates shouting in distance]
303007 Uh-oh...
30300c No more Pinkies! I can't take it!
303000 [drum banging]
303007 Gosh, uh... I wonder what fun they're having raising the barn at Applejack's right now! Maybe I'd better go check!
3031bd [sounds of exertion]
303000 [Pinkie duplicates shouting "Fun!"]
3031bc [laughs]
303008 No!
303000 [crash]
303007 Oh, phew! Looks like I haven't missed a thing!
303008 I wanna know right now where all you Pinkies came from, so I can find out who's responsible for y'all ruinin' our barn raisin'!
303000 [crash]
303007 Uh, you look pretty busy right now, so [laughs nervously] maybe we should talk a little later?
3031bb Fun! Fun! Fun! Fun!
303008 Y'all come back here and clean up after yourselves this instant!
303000 [duplicates shouting]
303007 Oh no, what have I done, what have I done?! My poor friends...
303000 [ponies shouting angrily]
303003 Okay, everypony, please, calm down!
30300d Calm down? I just had a Pinkie hurricane raging through my shop!
30300e And they trashed our critter picnic!
303000 [ponies shouting angrily]
303003 Please, everypony, hang on while I try to figure something out! Come on, Spike. I've gotta try to remember the name of that legend she mentioned.
303000 [wood creaking]
303000 [thud]
303003 Aha, here it is! "The legend of the Mirror Pond"... It describes a spell I can use to send them back where they came from!
303005 That's perfect! Let's go!
303003 But there's a catch. If I can't figure out which one's the real Pinkie, I might send her back by mistake!
303005 Well, we'll just have to figure out who the real one is then. Shouldn't be too hard.
303003 Does anypony here know how we can tell the real Pinkie Pie from all the rest of them?
30300f ["Uh...", "I don't know", etc.]
303007 Twilight! I have to talk to you, I need your help!
303003 Excuse me, whoever you are, but I'm not talking to any of you Pinkies unless you're the real Pinkie.
303007 Oh, but, but I am the real Pinkie!
3031bc No, you're not! I'm the real Pinkie!
3031bf I'm the real Pinkie!
3031c0 No, I'm the real Pinkie!
3031c1 I'm the real Pinkie!
3031c2 No, I'm the real Pinkie!
3031c3 I'm the real Pinkie!
3031bb ["Fun! Fun! Fun!"]
303008 How in tarnation are we supposed to tell which is the real Pinkie?
303003 I have no idea.
303007 Me either. Ohh... We've all got the same adorable tails, we've all got the same adorable manes, we've all got the same adorable hooves! Which one of us is the real Pinkie?! Oh! I haven't the slightest clue! And if I can't tell us apart... who can? [crying]
3031bb ["Fun! Fun! Fun!"]
303000 [duplicates shouting]
303000 [windows slamming]
303003 Ugh, this is hopeless!
303005 Maybe that one's the real Pinkie.
303003 Please. The real Pinkie Pie never sat that long in one place her whole life!
303005 I'm gonna go ask.
303003 Of course she's gonna say she's the real Pinkie! They all do! You're wasting your time.
303005 So lemme guess. You're the real Pinkie Pie.
303007 Heck if I know. Could be any one of us if you ask me. And if I said I was the real Pinkie, you wouldn't even believe me anyway. So just leave me alone. I've got some important poking the ground with my hoof to do.
303003 Oh, Spike, how're we gonna do this? I can't risk sending the real Pinkie back into the pond!
303005 I miss the real Pinkie.
303007 [sighs] I bet she misses you too. Bet she'd do just about anything to get to be with her friends again. Hey. Hey! What if you gave them a test? Pick something really hard for a Pinkie to do, something not fun at all! Any Pinkie that can't do it goes back into the pond. But whoever wants to stay the most, that must be the real Pinkie!
303003 You know, that's not a bad idea.
303007 This is great! If I pass, I get to be with my friends again! [gasps] But what if I don't pass? Oh, what if I'm not the real Pinkie Pie?! Ohhhh! Stupid [thud] magic [thud] mirror [thud] water! This is all your fault! ...And mine. [thud]
30300c Hey, Twilight!
303003 I've been looking all over for you ponies. What are you all doing here?
30300c Fluttershy spoke with the woodland critters, and they've agreed to take us into their home 'til the Pinkie storm dies down.
303003 You guys, we're gonna fix this. And I know exactly how.
30300e Are we gonna lose our real Pinkie Pie?
303003 I don't think so. Now come along. I've already got Applejack and her family rounding up all the Pinkies.
303000 [rumbling]
303000 [duplicates shouting]
303008 Hyah, ya Pinkies! Hyah!
3031bc Ooh, they wanna play chase! This is fun, too!
303000 [duplicates shouting, continues under]
303008 Oh, give it a rest.
303003 Welcome, Pinkies, welcome. Please have a seat and make yourselves comfortable. [pause] Okay, I suppose you can't be comfortable staying in one place, but have a seat anyway. [pause] Sit down!
303000 [duplicates stop shouting]
303003 Better. Now, I suppose you're all wondering why I've gathered you all here today.
3031bc For fun?
303003 No, just the opposite actually.
30300c Wait up, I got one more! Found this one poking at the ground with her hoof, drawing frowny faces.
303003 Have her come sit with the others.
303000 [thud]
303003 Pinkies, you've been brought here to take a test.
3031bb [in chorus] Awww!
303003 Don't worry, it's a simple test, about as simple as they come, and whoever passes gets to stay.
303000 [duplicates making huh noises, yeah]
303003 Curtain, please. The test... will be watching paint dry!
303000 [duplicates gasping]
303003 On your mark, get set, go!
303005 Ooh, this is so exciting!
303005 Okay, maybe not that exciting.
303000 [bird chirping]
3031bc Oh, hey, look at the birdie!
303003 [grunts]
303000 [poof]
3031bc Watch me bounce and touch the ceiling!
303000 [poof]
303000 [frog croaking]
3031bc Is that... is that a frog crossed with an orange?
3031bf Cool!
3031c0 Where?
303000 [poof]
3031bc Look what I can do with my hooves! [blows]
303000 [popping noises]
303000 [poof]
3031bc Betcha can't make a face crazier than... this!
303000 [poof]
303003 [sounds of exertion] [blows]
303000 [long pause]
30300c Ugh, I can't take it anymore! Somepony's making balloon animals!
3031bc What? Where?
303000 [poof]
303003 Pinkie, you can look away now.
303007 I passed?
303003 You passed. You're the only Pinkie who kept staring at the wall.
303007 I had to. I just had to. I couldn't leave my friends, I just couldn't. But I guess sometimes I will have to choose between them.
303003 I knew you'd be up to the challenge.
303007 I'm me! I'm me! I'm me! Or am I? Yeah, I'm pretty sure I am.
303007 Dear Princess Celestia,
303007 It's great to have fun, but it's even greater to have great friends. And having lots of friends means that you sometimes have to make choices as to who you'll spend your time with. But that's okay, because good friends will always give you lots of opportunities to have fun. So even if you're missing out, it's never for long.
303007 Respectfully yours,
303007 Pinkie Pie.
303005 [blows fire]
303003 Hi, Pinkie Pie. We were thinking we should go out and celebrate.
303008 You up for some wheelbarrow races?
30300c Or I could take everypony on a cloud ride!
30300d I could throw a party with punch and zesty cucumber sandwiches! Ooh!
303007 You wanna know exactly what I feel like doing right now? [sighs] [snores]
30300e That looks like fun.
303000 [all laughing]
303008 Oh, Pinkie.
303000 [door closes]
303000 [music]
303000 [credits]
30400a [whining] What to wear, what to wear? Oh, what to wear?!
304008 Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom. It's not like it's the Harvest Day Parade! We're just goin' to the train station!
30400a Too casual. Too summery.
304008 [sigh] Your cousin isn't gonna care what you're wearin'. Just pick somethin'!
30400a This is my first time meetin' her, and she's from Manehattan. I wanna make a good impression!
304008 You know what would make a good impression?
30400a What?
304008 Bein' on time to pick her up!
30400a [whining]
304008 You got nothin' to worry about, sugarcube. Y'all are gonna get along great. You already have somethin' in common.
30400a [muffled, through snorkel] Oh, yeah? What's that?
304008 Neither of you have your cutie mark.
30400a What?! How could you forget to tell me somethin' like that?
304008 Well, I–
30400a Oh, this changes everything! Meet you at the train station! I'm gonna go tell Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo!
304008 You know, your cousin is supposed to sleep in here!
304000 [theme song]
304080 [laughing]
304065 Do you really think she'll wanna join?
30400a She doesn't have her cutie mark. Of course she'll wanna join the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
304066 I'm just so excited I could burst!
304000 [train whistle blows]
30400a Is that the train from Manehattan?
304008 Yep.
30400a That's her! Oh, wait, no, no, that's not her. Oh! No, tha-tha-that's her! Um, no. Oh, wait, tha– that's not her either, uh...
304008 Apple Bloom, you've never met Babs Seed, remember?
30400a Oh... [laughs nervously] Yeah.
304000 [train lets off steam]
304008 Ah, that's her!
30400a Babs! Babs! It's me, your cousin, Apple Bloom! And this is Sweetie Belle, and this is Scootaloo, and we are so, so, so glad you're here!
3041c4 Thanks, I'm happy to–
304066 This is gonna be the best week of your life!
3041c4 Sure hope it's gonna be–
304065 Seriously, we are gonna have a blast.
304008 [laughs]
304066 The Summer Harvest Parade's going on while you're here! You'll get to ride in a float!
3041c4 Really? I've never been on a float before.
30400a And we've got a really big surprise for you!
3041c4 Yeah... uh... a surprise?
30400a I give you... the Cutie Mark Crusaders Clubhouse!
3041c4 The Cutie Mark Crusaders?
304065 A club devoted to helping ponies get their cutie marks! We're its founding members.
304066 Technically, we're its only members.
30400a But we're always looking to expand, and you seem like the perfect candidate!
3041c4 I do?
304065 Well, yeah, since you don't have a cutie mark and all.
3041c4 Oh, yeah... [blows] That...
30400a Allow me to show you just some of the highlights of our clubhouse, should you choose to join us. This is where we do our roll call...
304066 Huh.
30400a This is where we eat our lunch...
304066 [munching]
30400a Sometimes we stand here and think of great ideas.
304000 [ding]
3041c4 Yeah, uh...
304000 [pause]
30400a Uh, could you excuse us for a moment?
3041c4 Sure...
30400a [hushed] Thought she'd be more impressed.
304066 [hushed] She's from Manehattan. If we wanna impress her, we need to really wow her!
304080 Hmmmm.
304065 [gasps] [hushed] The float! She can ride with us on our Summer Harvest Parade float!
30400a [hushed] That's perfect! This really is a good spot for thinking up great ideas.
304080 Mm-hmm.
30400a Here it is! The official Cutie Mark Crusaders float for the Summer Harvest Parade!
304065 As a member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, you'd be able to ride on it with us! It'd be totally fun.
3041c4 [laughs nervously]
30405c More like funny...
304060 ...looking! [laughing]
30405f What is that thing, a giant orange?
304060 [laughing]
30400a It's a pumpkin.
30405c More like a lame-kin.
30405f [laughs]
30405c Who's the new blank flank?
30400a She's mah cousin, Babs. She's from Manehattan!
30405c Manehattan, huh? Well, I guess you have that going for you.
30405f Suppose you're gonna join their little club? What's it called? The [mockingly] Cutie Mark Crusaders?
3041c4 [blows] More like the Cutie Mahk Crybabies! [derisive chuckle]
30400a Hey!
30405c Oooo, heh, big city attitude! I like it!
30405f Mm-hmm!
3041c4 Oh yeah? Well there's more where that came from! Check this out! [grunts]
304065 Oh no she didn't!
3041c5 [laughs]
304000 [creaking, rolling, crashing]
3041c4 Looks like somepony's pumpkin just got squashed!
304060 [laughs]
30400a When ah tell Applejack–
3041c4 You gonna tell Applejack what?
30400a W-well, y'know, uh...
3041c4 What're you, a snitch?
30405c Come on, Babs, you should hang with us! Y'know, the cool ponies, not these babies!
30400a What... just happened?
304065 I think Babs just went to the dark side.
304066 We have to tell Applejack!
30400a No! We're not snitches!
304065 Yeah! And we're not babies!
304066 Then... why do I feel like crying?
304065 I still can't believe she ruined our pumpkin float.
30400a I still can't believe I'm related to such a big stinkin' bully!
304066 [sighs] What are we gonna do?
30400a We're gonna build a new float, that's what.
304065 Why bother? She'll probably just ruin that one, too.
30400a [sighs]
304066 We could always tell Applejack.
3041c4 [echoing] What are you, a snitch?
30407f No!
304066 [groans]
30400a We're not gonna be a bunch of tattle-tales! Besides, she's only here a couple of weeks. We'll just avoid her like the plague until she goes home.
304065 Avoid her. Yeah, how hard can that be?
304000 [Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo]
304000 Yeah, yeah, yeah
304000 Yeah, yeah, yeah
304000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
30400a [Apple Bloom]
30400a First, we thought that Babs was so really, really sweet
30400a A new friend to have, and it seemed like such a treat
304065 [Scootaloo]
304065 But then, we found the truth; she's just a bully from the east
304065 She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast
30400a [Apple Bloom]
30400a Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead
304000 [Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo]
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
304000 Got a bully on our tail
304000 Gotta hide, we gotta bail
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you
304000 Gotta run, we gotta flee
304000 Gotta hurry, don't you see?
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed
304000 Yeah, yeah, yeah
304000 Yeah, yeah, yeah
304000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
30400a [Apple Bloom]
30400a Hiding from a bully, we know it isn't right
30400a But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight
304065 [Scootaloo]
304065 Oh, she'll go home soon, and then we'll have some peace again
304065 But for now, we're staying out of her way 'til then
30400a [Apple Bloom]
30400a Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead
304000 [Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo]
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
304000 Got a bully on our tail
304000 Gotta hide, we gotta bail
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you
304000 Gotta run, we gotta flee
304000 Gotta hurry, don't you see?
304000 Why so mean? Why so crude?
304000 Why so angry? Why so rude?
304000 Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends?
304000 Isn't it sad? Is this how it all ends?
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad-
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad-
304000 Babs Seed, Babs Seed-
304065 [Scootaloo]
304065 She's just a bad, bad seed!
30400a Babs may have run us out of town, but at least we still have the club–
3041c4 Hey! What're you doing at my clubhouse?
304065 Y- y- your clubhouse?! This is our clubhouse!
3041c4 Well, it was yours, and now it's mine.
30405f And mine.
30405c And mine.
30400a That's not fair, Babs! We never did anything to you!
3041c4 And let's keep it that way. Now scram, crybabies!
3041c5 Bump, bump, sugar-lump, rump!
3041c5 [laughing]
304066 [takes deep breaths] [wails]
304066 [crying]
30400a That Babs has really gone too far this time!
304065 Kicked out of our own clubhouse!
30400a And my own bed!
304065 Seriously?
30400a Super-seriously.
304066 We need to talk to Applejack.
30407f No!
304066 Rarity?
30407f No!
304066 Twilight?
30400a No, no, no! We need to fight back!
304065 Yeah! Fight back! How're we gonna do that?
304000 [Pinkie's polka begins playing in background]
30400a [gasp] By makin' her the guest of honor at the Summer Harvest Parade!
304065 [gasps] Yeah! Wait, what?
30400a [laughs under her breath] When you look up 'embarrassed' in the dictionary... [deep breath] Her face will be there!
3041c4 [snoring]
304066 Moo! Moo!
304000 [cow chewing]
304066 Moo! Moo!
304000 [squeaking]
3041c4 Aheh... [resumes snoring]
30400a Are those from the Carousel Boutique?
304066 Yup.
30400a Excellent.
304065 [blows]
304066 Ooh!
304065 Luster dust from Sugarcube Corner. They use it for decorating cakes.
304066 That must be what Rarity uses on her emergency edible boots!
304065 The gears and bands for the moving mechanism, my tools and stuff... Did you bring the thing from the place?
304066 What's that?
30400a Granny Smith's kitchen timer.
304066 What's that for?
304065 [sing-song voice] You'll see! [giggles]
30400a C'mon, y'all, let's get to it. We only got a few hours before mornin', and this thing has to look so good, Babs won't be able to resist wanting to ride in it!
304000 [A-Team-like music]
304000 [scissors cutting]
304000 [hammering]
304066 [yawns] Is this it?
304065 [tired] I think... we're a go.
304066 [tired] Good, 'cause we'd better get out of here before Babs finds us.
304080 [tired] Cutie Mark Crusaders, ho!
304000 [Pinkie's polka plays in background]
304162 Hot carrot crêpes! Get 'em here, get 'em hot!
304000 [thud]
304005 [licks lips]
304000 [wrench noises]
3041c4 [blows] Whoaaaa...
304066 Isn't it smashing? No! I-I didn't mean smashing! I mean... Isn't it a hit? No! No, I- No! No hitting! I meant–
304065 Well, don't even think about riding it, Babs.
304066 Ow!
304000 [motor running]
304065 You had your chance.
304000 [boing]
3041c4 See ya later, Cutie Mark Crybabies!
304000 [door slams]
30400a [hushed] The timer set?
304066 Teach her to fool with the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
304008 Y'all are letting Babs ride in your golden apple float?
30400a Yeah. We thought she deserved to be the... center of attention.
304080 [giggling]
304008 Well, that's just super sweet of y'all, makin' Babs feel so special. Y'know, after all the heartache she's been havin' in Manehattan.
30400a Heartache?
304008 Well, I didn't say nothin' 'cause I didn't want her to feel singled out, but there's been some bullies back in Manehattan just been teasin' her to pieces for her blank flank.
30400a T-t-t-teased?
304066 B-Bullies?!
304008 Yup. She came up to the farm to get away from all her problems back home. I'm so proud of y'all. You've done a good deed.
304000 [balloons deflating]
304065 So that's why she jumped in when Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon started giving us a hard time.
30400a She didn't want to be bullied like at home, so she decided to be a bully instead!
304066 And now we've turned into bullies too!
304080 What do we do?!
304000 [crowd cheering]
30405c Nice float, Babs.
3041c4 Snagged it from those whiny baby blank flanks.
30405c Too cool for mule, Babs.
30402d [brays]
30400a We gotta stop that float!
304000 [kitchen timer ticking]
304000 [band playing very loudly]
30400a [almost inaudible] Applejack, quick you have to–
304008 Huh?
30400a [almost inaudible] Quick, you have to help us–
304008 What?
304000 [band stops]
30400a We booby-trapped it!
304000 [pause]
304000 [band suddenly starts again]
304065 Babs! Bully! Payback! No time to explain! We've just gotta get Babs out of that float!
304000 [kitchen timer ticking]
3041c6 Oof, my popcorn!
30400a Sorry!
304065 'Scuse me! Ah, whoops.
30400a Whoa!
304065 Pinkie Pie, let us in!
304007 [laughs] Funny joke!
30400a No, really! Let- us- in!
304007 Ohhh! Here!
304000 [tires screeching]
304000 [ponies panicking]
30400a Babs! You gotta get out of that float!
3041c4 You're not getting your float back, crybabies!
304066 But it's booby tra–
304000 [thud]
304007 Veggie salad!
30400a Huh?
304007 Veggie salad!
304000 [crash]
304007 [sighs] Veggie salad. [munching]
30400a Seriously?
304000 [engine driving away]
304007 Hey! Don't leave me! [laughs] Leaf me! [laughs]
304000 [kitchen timer ticking]
304000 [kitchen timer ringing]
3041c4 What the–
30400a Babs! Babs!
3041c4 Oof!
30400a [yelling] Oooh, sweet applesauce!
304000 [thud]
304000 [squelch]
304080 [groans of pain]
30400a Maybe we'll get our cutie marks in stupidest ideas of all time.
304000 [camera clicking]
304008 Are y'all okay?
304066 Yeah... we're fine.
304065 No sweat.
3041c4 After I'd been so mean to ya... you saved me!
30400a [sighs] About that...
3041c4 I don't get it! I saw it all happen! You pushed me out just when the float was about to head into the lake!
304065 Except... we were the reason it was headed into the lake.
304066 We booby trapped the float.
30400a Y'see Babs, we were tryin' to get you back for bein' a big bully...
304065 But then Applejack told us about how you were being bullied back in Manehattan.
304066 And we figured out you were just doing it to avoid getting picked on in Ponyville. But, by then... we were the ones being bullies. And... Oh, why does life have to be so ironic?!
30400a Guess what we're trying to say is...
304080 We're sorry.
3041c4 [blows] I'm sorry too.
304008 [sighs] Y'know, this all could've been avoided if y'all just came to me in the very beginning.
304066 That's what I kept on saying!
3041c4 So... can we... start over?
30400a Definitely.
304065 Yeah.
304000 [Scootaloo playing timpani]
304066 "We, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, elect Babs Seed to join us as a sister, friend, confidaynte, alley, boss-om buddy, gal pal, compader, chum of chums..."
304065 [clears throat]
304066 Well you wrote this.
304065 Oh, uh, yeah...
304066 "Homegirl... Amiga..." Blah blah blah blah blah. Oh, yes, here. "...and fellow Cutie Mark Crusader! You are solemnly sworn in, here this day, in witness of your fellow sisters, friends, confidantes... boss-om buddies... compadres..."
304065 Congratulations! [quickly, under her breath] Gotta remember to revise that.
304080 [laughing]
3041c4 [blows]
30400a So you promise you're gonna start our Manehattan branch of the Cutie Mark Crusaders, right?
3041c4 Yeah, and I promise to keep talking to my big sis about the teasing back home.
304008 Good. And if you have any problems, we've got your back too, y'hear?
30405c So you're leaving huh? Great! Now we're stuck here with these lame blank flanks.
3041c4 Hey! That's not how you talk to my friends!
30405f F-friends?
3041c4 Yeah, you got a problem with that?
30405c Well, what if I do? What are you gonna do about it?
3041c4 Tell your mothers about your bad attitudes!
304000 [splat]
304000 [pig grunts]
304066 I'm sure gonna miss that bad seed.
304008 Bad seed? I thought y'all were friends now?
304066 No, see, first we called her 'bad seed' as in actually a bad seed, but now she's bad as in good. Get it?
304008 Yea... No.
304080 [laughing]

305000 [shop bell ringing]
305000 [items clattering]
3051c7 May I help you, traveler? Hmm, something drew you to my shop... something powerful. Ah, you have a keen eye. The Alicorn Amulet is one of the most mysterious and powerful of all the known magical charms. Uh, ah— I'm afraid this is... far too dangerous.
305000 [bits clinking]
3051c7 [quickly] Would you like that gift-wrapped?
305000 [theme song]
30500e Don't be scared, little friends. Twilight is wonderful with magic. [to Twilight] Anything happens to them, Twilight, so help me...
305005 Aww, don't worry, Fluttershy, Twilight's magic has gotten a lot better since she accidentally crushed me and Applejack with a giant snowball.
30500e Of course she's good with magic. Twilight's great with magic. I guess I just don't want my little friends to be scared. Oh, oh, look how scared they are!
305000 [animals chittering]
305003 I promise, Fluttershy. Nothing bad will happen to them.
30500e [high-pitched] I know! Stop, stop! They can't take it!
305000 [animals chittering and cheering]
30500e [teeth chattering]
305005 Twilight, that looks amazing!
305003 Phew!
305000 [animals chittering]
305003 That's all for now, little ones. Maybe we can practice again later, if Fluttershy says it's alright.
305000 [animals chittering]
305005 Your magic has really improved since we came to Ponyville, Twilight. Princess Celestia's going to love it.
305003 Thanks, Spike. I have to be at my best when she arrives with the delegates from Saddle Arabia. I can't believe she's trusting me with the entertainment.
305000 [thud]
30500c Twilight! Come quick! It's an emergency!
305000 [poof]
30500d [gasp] You beast! This shade of brown should only be used for accents!
305007 Come on, Applejack. We've got to get her in a nice, soothing pink, stat!
305003 What's going on here?
305037 Well, well, well. If it isn't... Twilight Sparkle.
305000 [ponies gasp]
305003 [gasps] Trixie!
305005 What's she doing here?
30500c You call that great and powerful?
305000 [poof]
30500c [yelps]
305036 Oh! She's Rainbow Wobble, now!
305035 Yeah! Ha ha ha ha!
30500c [yelps]
305035 Good spell, oh Great and Powerful Trixie!
305037 You two! Quiet!
305000 [poof]
305036 Uh, hey! W— What happened?
305035 Get off of me! Brbrbr.
305036 Let go!
305035 Go this way!
305003 Stop picking on my friends, Trixie!
305037 You and I have some unfinished business. My magic's gotten better since I was here last. And I'm going to prove it! Me and you, a magic duel. Winner stays, loser leaves Ponyville forever!
305003 Forget it! I'd never make a deal like that!
305037 Hm. Your choice.
305005 [yelps]
305000 [bouncing]
305003 Trixie, put him down. Why are you doing this?
305037 Why? Because you humiliated me! After you showed me up with that Ursa Minor, I became a laughing stock! Everywhere I went I was laughed at and ostracized. I even had to take a job on a rock farm just to earn a living! A rock farm!
305007 Hey! You're lucky a rock farm would take the likes of you!
305000 ["click and drag" sounds]
305037 Now I want revenge! And I'll just keep casting spells 'til you agree. Well? What do you say?
3051c8 [grunting]
305005 Whoooaah! Help... me!
305003 Alright, Trixie. Let's duel!
305037 Excellent.
305000 [thud]
30500d [crying]
305007 [indignant muffled noises]
305037 If I lose, I won't set hoof in Ponyville again. But if you lose, you're the one banished from this one-horse town!
3051c9 [gasps]
305037 Draw!
305000 [poof]
305000 [ponies gasping]
305023 [Wilhelm scream]
305003 [grunts] Phew. [gasps]
305000 [parasprite burping]
305003 [exhales]
305025 [laughing]
305000 [snips]
305037 Snips, Snails, step forward!
305036 Wh— what is it, oh Great and P— P— Powerful Trixie? [laughs nervously]
3051ca [crying]
305003 An age spell? But... how could you do an age spell? That's only for the highest level unicorns!
305037 Well, Twilight? Give up?
305003 [sighs] [grunts]
3051ca [surprised noise]
305005 Come on, Twilight, you can do it!
305000 [magic sputtering]
305000 [thud]
3051ca [crying]
3051cb [spine clicking]
305037 Trixie is the highest level unicorn! [laughs] And now it's time for you to leave Ponyville! FOREVER!
305008 That's enough, Trixie!
30500d You proved your point, but you can't possibly expect Twilight to leave Ponyville!
305037 You fools! She's already gone!
305003 [yelps]
305000 [pop]
305000 [thud]
305003 It's okay, guys. I'll figure something out. Just take care of each other. And keep an eye on Trixie. There's something strange about her.
305005 Twilight? [thunk]
305003 [grunts of exertion] Ugh! It's impossible! How could Trixie know such advanced magic? Without Spike, I can't get a message to the Princess in Saddle Arabia. So who else do I know who understands strange and powerful magic?
305047 Your tale of woe upsets me so. [sips] No wonder you're dour. It's an abuse of power!
305003 I don't know what to do, Zecora. I feel like I've abandoned my friends. But I can't take her on horn-to-horn.
305047 [sips] If you train with me, so good you'll be. I'll show you the way to make sure she won't stay.
305003 You'll train me in magic? But she was doing age spells, weather spells, you name it!
305047 When it comes to magic, it would be tragic if somepony licked me, especially Trixie.
305003 You really think I can beat her?
305047 Mm-hmm.
305003 Okay, when do we start?
305037 You two! Hurry up with my throne. And you, how long do I have to wait for my applesauce facial?
305008 Forget it, Trixie! I ain't doing nothin' 'til you let Twilight come home! [laughs uncontrollably] Okay, I'll do it! Just make it stop! Hoo!
305000 [crash]
305037 I thought I told you to dance!
30500d Oh, Trixie's cruel magic is ruining Ponyville. Ow! [whines] Oh, somepony has to help us!
305047 Ah, no noise, no sound, no din, no fuss must interfere with your focus. Unlearn what you have learned. Only then can victory be earned.
305003 [grunts]
305037 [echoing] Trixie is the highest level unicorn! [laughs]
305000 [splash]
305003 [yelps]
305000 [splash]
305047 There is much, much that I can teach, but the answer you need may still be out of reach.
305003 I'm sorry, Zecora. I'm trying my best, but... I can't stop thinking about Trixie. There was something different about her. It's like she's gone from high and mighty to mean and nasty.
305047 Your thinking needs a readjust. Total concentration is a must.
305000 [wind whistling]
30500d Ugh, this really doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere.
305007 [muffled noises]
305008 I hear you, Pinkie. I can't find anything that describes the kind of magic Trixie's doin'.
305005 Ugh, there must be something! Twilight has every magic book there is!
30500e [quietly] Um, I think I may have found something?
30500d Yes, it's time for us to consider our futures in this new Trixie-led Ponyville.
30500e [quietly] Um, this sounds an awful lot like Trixie's magic–
305008 She wants me to grow apples with no peels! Now how the hay am I supposed to do that?
30500e [quietly] Um, there's a picture here of that necklace–
305007 [muffled noises]
30500e [quietly] It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold—
305005 Hey, everypony, look! This book has a picture of Trixie's necklace! It's called the Alicorn Amulet, and whoever wears it is blessed with untold powers!
30500e [quietly] If you read a little further, you'll see—
30500d [reading] Even though it provides great power, it also corrupts the user!
30500e [quietly] Yes, but, um, you can't—
305005 [reading] You can't just take the Alicorn Amulet off her neck, it has a magical lock! Trixie's the only pony who can take it off!
30500e [quietly] Maybe we could—
305008 We need to get this information to Twilight. She'll know what to do.
30500e [quietly] But, h— how—
30500d If any of us try to leave, Trixie's magical force field will tell her!
30500e [quietly] Maybe we should—
30500c I've got it! Trying to sneak past the force field would be impossible without help, but I know who's got the goods to get into those woods!
30500e [quietly] It— it must be—
30500c Fluttershy!
30500e Whaaat?!
305000 [thud]
305008 What do you say, Fluttershy? Can you handle the mission?
30500e No! I'll crack under the pressure! I'll snap like a twig!
30500c Perfect! Fluttershy'll sneak out of Ponyville and find Twilight.
30500e But— but I, I—
305000 [thud]
30500e [teeth chattering] [sighs] Okay.
305008 Alright!
3051cc [general agreement]
30500d I know just the design for a dangerous mission outfit!
305039 [grunts of exertion]
305037 Pull, you fools! [cracks whip] Somepony set off the magic force field, and Trixie intends to punish them!
305036 [gasping] But... wouldn't it be faster if we had some... wheels?!
305037 The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't trust wheels. Now pull faster!
305035 [gasping] I'm telling ya, Snips, she's getting weirder and weirder!
305000 [whip cracking]
305039 [grunts of exertion]
305037 Stop! You there! What are you doing?!
305000 [beaver chittering angrily]
305000 [thud]
305000 [poof]
305035 Gah, why is she so mean to us?
305036 Yeah! I miss the days when she was just a fraud!
305000 [whip cracking]
305000 [grinding noises]
305000 [beaver chittering]
30500e Oh, oh dear! Rarity's dangerous mission outfit is ruined! Guess we'd better go back! [laughs nervously]
305000 [beaver chittering]
305000 [birds tweeting]
30500e Oh, okay, okay, you're right. I need to be brave and find Twilight.
305000 [bird tweeting]
30500e Oh! Y— you found her?
305000 [bird tweeting]
30500e She's in the Everfree Forest?! Oh, this is me being brave! I wanna be brave at home, locked in my closet, with my teddy bear!
30500e [sips]
305003 I can't believe I didn't recognize the Alicorn Amulet!
30500e The more she uses it, the more it will corrupt her!
305003 But how am I supposed to beat that amulet? My magic's not good enough!
305047 Twilight Sparkle, much work have you done. You learned all of my lessons; all but one. If Trixie's tricks have you in a fix, you must nix your magic and use the six.
305003 Nix your magic, use the six... Nix your magic, use the six! Use the six! That's it! Zecora, you're a genius! Now we'll need to get you back inside Ponyville, Fluttershy.
305000 [dragging noises]
305037 This better not be another false alarm, or the Great and Powerful Trixie will– [gasps] You! [muffled] What's the matter, Twilight Sparkle? Not enjoying your exile?
305003 I know about the Alicorn Amulet. I know you cheated.
305037 Cheated? Moi?
305003 Yeah. And I thought you might wanna see what a real magical amulet looks like. Zecora gave it to me. [muffled] It's from beyond the Everfree Forest, [normal] and it's way more powerful than your measly little Alicorn Amulet!
305037 Ha! Nothing's more powerful than the Alicorn Amulet! And nopony's more powerful than the Great and Powerful Trixie!
305003 [muffled] Care to put your amulet where your mouth is? [normal] How about another duel?
305037 [muffled] Why should I? I already beat you.
305003 That's up to you! But I guess you'll never see the totally awesome magic from beyond the Everfree Forest. Come on, Zecora.
305037 Wait!
305000 [poof]
305037 Okay, okay, you're on! A second duel.
305000 [thunder]
305037 Let's start with a simple age spell, shall we?
305003 Let's.
305037 Snips, Snails.
305000 [poof]
3051cd [crying]
305037 An oldie, but a goodie, ha. Now, let's see what your little charm can do.
305003 No problem. Um, Applejack, Rarity? Could you help me, please?
305008 Huh?
30500d Huh?
305000 [magic zap]
305037 Oh, ho-hum. So you can do an age spell, big deal.
305000 [magic zaps]
305037 That's... That's impossible!
305003 That's nothing!
305000 [magic zap]
30500c Yow!
305037 How did you–
305003 Duplication spell. Ever see one pony play ten instruments?
305000 [magic zap]
305007 [plays one-pony band]
305037 This... just can't be!
305003 Ooh, one more. I can turn a mare into a stallion.
305000 [magic zap]
3051cf [nervously] Eeyup.
305000 [magic zap]
305003 Well, Trixie, looks like my amulet is more powerful than yours– Hey! Give it back!
305037 [laughs] With this amulet, I shall now rule all of Equestria!
305000 [electricity sparking]
305037 Witness, my subjects. Gaze upon an ever greater and 'powerful-er' Trixie!
305000 [thunder]
305037 Hey! [scoffs] I don't need that old Alicorn Amulet. I have this!
305000 [electricity crackling]
30500c [laughs] Stop it! Tha— that tickles!
305037 Tickles?! That was supposed to make you writhe in agony! This amulet is defective! [magic zap] Give mine back!
30500c Sorry. This is going back into hiding where it belongs.
305003 By the way, Trixie, the amulet around your neck? It's one of Zecora's doorstops.
305037 [upset] But... how did you do those spells? Nopony can do those spells!
305003 You're right. Not even me. Zecora taught me so much about magic while I was in exile. She even taught me when not to use it. My magic alone wasn't powerful enough to take on the Alicorn Amulet head to head, so I needed to use a different kind of magic – the magic of friendship. I also knew that the only pony who could get the amulet off your neck was you.
305037 But... what about the pony with the ten instruments?
305003 That's not magic. That was just Pinkie Pie.
305007 [continues playing one-pony band]
305000 [ponies cheering]
305000 [birds singing]
305000 [ponies in awe]
3051d0 Oooh!
305000 [fireworks exploding]
305003 Trixie?
305037 It's the least I could do. I treated you and your friends so horribly when I was wearing that Alicorn Amulet. I just couldn't control myself. You can forgive me, can't you?
305003 Hmmm. Sure.
305037 Oh, good. Don't you think the Great and Apologetic Trixie is the most magnificent humble pony you've ever seen?!
305000 [poof]
305000 [thud]
305007 [angry muffled yells]
305000 [poof]
305007 [inhales]
305000 [music]
305000 [credits]
306000 [bits clinking]
306065 [wings buzzing]
306000 [ponies yelping]
306065 Whoo-hoo!
30600c [sips] Nice moves, kid.
306065 Nice moves? Rainbow Dash thinks I've got–
306000 [thud]
306065 [gasps] ...nice moves!
3061d1 [moos]
306000 [theme song]
306065 ...Then, all of a sudden, I'm airborne! And Rainbow Dash looks over and was like, "Nice moves, kid."
30600a Woooow.
306066 She really said that?
306065 I mean, it's like she practically told me she wanted to take me under her wing, teach me everything she knows, and become like my big sister!
30600a I dunno about all that.
306066 It was a really nice compliment and all, but...
306065 I know, I know. But all that stuff I said could happen, right?
30600a Sure.
306066 Absolutely.
306065 I just need to find a way to spend some time with her, y'know, so she can see more of my awesomeness.
30600a Well... Applejack and I are supposed to be campin' up at Winsome Falls this weekend. Maybe I could get my big sis to invite Rainbow Dash, and then you could come, too!
306065 Really?!
30600a Sure!
306066 I wanna go...
30600a Well, duh, of course you can go!
306066 And I'll get Rarity to come too! Rarity loves camping!
30600d I despise camping! All of that... [shudders] ...nature.
306066 Applejack's going with her little sister. But, y'know, if you don't wanna spend time with me... [squee]
30600d Oh, all right! Ooh! Of course I will need to find an outfit more appropriate for 'roughing it'. Ooh!
306066 See? Told you she'd wanna go.
306000 [water running]
306008 You packed bug spray?
30600a Yup. You got the canteens?
306008 Yup. Looks like we're all set then.
306000 [cart trundling]
30600d Hey!
306008 Gee, Rarity, did you remember to pack?
30600d Oh, well, let's see who gets the last laugh when you're absolutely desperate to curl your lashes, and you realize you didn't bring your eyelash curler.
306008 Well, looks like we're all set now.
306065 But what about Rainbow Dash? Isn't Rainbow Dash coming?
306008 'Course she is, sugarcube. She's gonna meet us up at our first campsite.
306065 Oh.
306008 Alright, y'all, let's move 'em out!
30600d Oh, are we there yet?
306008 The last thousand times you asked that, the answer was no. This time, it's actually yes. There's Rainbow Dash up there right now.
306000 [crunch]
306000 [thump]
306000 [splash]
306065 [quietly] Alright, Scootaloo, just play it cool. [normal] Hey Rai–
306000 [wobbling noise]
306000 [thud]
306065 [clears throat] Hey, Rainbow Dash! What's up?
30600c What took you guys so long?
306008 Well, some of us didn't pack as light as the others. So we were slowed down a bit.
306000 [hammering]
30600c Looks like you'll be sharing a tent with me, huh?
306065 Heh, if that's okay with you.
30600c Sure! Long as you don't snore. You don't snore, do you?
306065 Nope. No way. Not me. Never snored a day or [laughs nervously] night in my life.
30600c Then you and I are gonna get along just fine.
306000 [pop]
306000 [wind blowing]
30600c You have got to be kidding me.
30600d Sweetie Belle, do be a dear and see if you can find some fresh flowers for my bedside vase.
30600c [mimicking Rarity] Scootaloo, do be a sweetheart and see if you can gather some firewood.
30607f [laughing]
30600c Seriously though. Can you get us some wood for the fire?
306065 Of course!
306000 [fire lighting]
30600c Okay, everybody get comfortable, 'cause I'm about to tell you the best story you've ever heard.
306065 Is it about the time when Rarity had wings, and then they got ruined, and then you saved her from plummeting to her doom?
30600c Okay, maybe it's the second best story you've ever heard. But probably still the scariest. [spookily] You like scary stories, right?
306065 [gasps] Mm-hmm.
30600c It all happened on a night just like this one, in a forest, just like this...
30600c ...And then, The Olden Pony asked, [mimicking aged voice] "Who's got my rusty horseshoe?"
306066 Not me!
306000 [suspenseful pause]
30600c You do!
306081 [screaming]
30600c [laughing]
306065 [clears throat] Something in my throat. I wasn't scared at all, heheh. Good story.
30600c Knew you wouldn't be scared. The way you jumped that cart the other day, you're like me – fearless.
306065 [nervously] Yeah. Fearless. [teeth chattering]
306000 [owl hoots]
30600d [coddling] Don't worry. Rarity is here to keep you safe and sound. Ooh!
306008 [yawns] Think it's about time for me to hit the straw.
30600a [trembling]
306008 Don't you worry, little sis. There's no 'Olden Pony' in our tent.
306065 [nervously] Haa, that sure was funny, wasn't it? Heheh. How they were all afraid of The Olden Pony? Heh, but not me, heh!
30600c That's because you're tough, just like when I was your age!
306000 [splash]
306065 [yelps]
30600c I'm hitting the sack. Come in whenever you feel like it.
306000 [twig snaps]
306000 [leaves rustling]
306065 [nervously] It's, it's nothing... Just my imagination...
306000 [branches creaking]
306065 [nervously] And that isn't the thundering stomp of The Olden Pony...
306000 [wolf howling]
306000 [zip]
30600c [snoring loudly]
306000 [distant muttering]
306065 I-Is anyone out there?
306000 [hoof stamps]
306000 [branches creaking]
3061d2 [mumbling]
306065 [gasp] [panting]
3061d2 Who got my rusty horseshoe?
306065 [gasp] [panting] [neighs]
306000 [roar]
306000 [snap]
306065 [sighs]
3061d2 Who's got my rusty horseshoe?
306065 [cries] [dash] [panting] Rainbow Dash–?
3061d2 You do!
306065 [yelps]
30600c [snores]
306065 [nervous humming]
306065 [nervous humming]
30600c [yawns] What's that noise? Is there a bug in here? [sighs] I dunno about you, but I slept like a filly.
306065 [nervously] Best night ever.
30600c Glad you're rested up, because we've got a long trek ahead. Totally gonna be worth it when we get to Winsome Falls.
306000 [eerie noises]
306065 Yeah... Totally... [twitches]
30600d Ohh... Am I sweating? Oh! I think I'm sweating! Oh, uh, but it's absolutely worth it to get to spend time with my little sister. It's just that this cart feels like it's getting heavier all the time!
306008 I don't care if that cart's as heavy as a pack of mules. If we don't get a move on, it'll be dark before we get to the campsite!
306065 [gasps] Dark?! [wings buzzing] I'll just ride ahead and make sure the path is clear. We don't wanna be out here after dark, right?
30600c Doesn't matter to me.
306065 Well, y'know, [hushed] it's for the scaredy-ponies, heheh.
306065 [yawns]
306000 [thump]
306065 [gasps] Don't fall asleep now... We've got to get to that campsite before dark... [snores, continues over]
306000 [bonk]
3061d3 [growls]
3060ee [licks lips] [chomps] [grunts]
30600d [fades in] That's why it's always important to bring your own trunk on any public outing.
306065 [gasps] Um... don't come this way! Take the path! It's, heh, way better than going through the bushes.
306000 [twig snaps]
306065 [yelps]
306000 [poof]
306000 [crunch]
306008 You're more nervous than a worm in an apple on cider making day. What gives, Scootaloo?
306065 Heh, nothing, just thought I heard something, aheh.
306000 [owl hoots]
306065 [yelps]
306008 You sure you're okay? You seem a little jumpy.
306065 Just getting my exercise! You know how important it is to stretch out those hindquarters every so often, aheh.
306000 [frog croaking]
306000 [bells ringing]
306065 Uh, d-do you need a little help?
30600d That's so sweet, thank you.
306065 Um... what are friends for? [sounds of exertion]
306000 [cart creaking]
306008 No need for tents tonight, y'all. We'll just take shelter in that cave.
30600c All right! A deep, dark cave! Perfect for the story I've got for tonight. All we need is a campfire, and we're good to go.
306065 [gulps] [nervously] Uh, of course...
306000 [wolf howling]
306065 [nervously] I'll be right back with lots of firewood from the deep... dark... not-scary-at-all forest!
30600c Thanks.
306000 [creatures growling]
306065 [breathing heavily] [sighs] Okay. I can do this. On the count of three, I get those branches. One... two... three! [trembling] [sighs] [nervously] Here, branches branches branches...
306008 Bbbbrrr! Hoo-wee! It's colder than a timberwolf's toenail. Bbbrr! Where's that Scootaloo?
306065 [panicked laughing] Here you go!
30600c That's it?
306065 It's all I could find, 'cause, y'know, there aren't that many trees around here!
306008 It's all we need. Why don't you sit with Rainbow Dash for a while?
306000 [fire starts]
30600c Now, where was I? Oh yeah, the [spookily] scary part. [laughs evilly]
306065 Hey, I have an idea! How about I tell tonight's story?
30600c Alright, just make sure it's a horrible one.
306065 There once was a really really nice pony who lived in a bright and sunny land, where there are rainbows every day, and lots and lots of happy friends, and–
30600c No offense, but it's not a real campfire story unless somepony's shaking. [spookily] I've been told that these very woods are haunted...
306065 [gulps]
30600c [spookily] ...by The Headless Horse! It gallops only at night–
306008 If it doesn't have a head, then how in tarnation does this pony know where it's goin'?
30600c It's headless, not brainless. [spookily] ...looking for little lost ponies–
306008 So where's its brain?
30600c Ugh. [spookily] Fear was dripping from the air...
30600c [spookily] ...and they were never heard from ever again!
306066 [gasps] Never?
30600c Never.
306000 [fire sparks]
306081 [screaming] [laughing]
306065 [trembling]
30600d Don't worry, you'll be safe with me tonight.
306065 It's not time for bed yet, is it?
306008 'Fraid so, Scootaloo.
306065 Uh, but we haven't even sung any campfire songs yet! [squeak]
306066 You don't have to ask me twice!
306000 [thud]
306066 [singing] Ninety-nine buckets of oats on the wall, ninety-nine buckets of oats! Take one down [...] pass it around, you got eighty-one buckets of oats on the wall [...] forty-one buckets of oats! Take one down, pass it around you got forty... buckets of oats on the wall! [...] buckets of oats! Take one down, pass it around, you've got zero buckets of oats on the waaaaaaaalllllll!!!! [snores]
3061aa [yawning]
30600d Good night, Sweetie Belle.
306008 Good night, y'all.
30600a Good night, y'all.
30600c Sleep tight.
306065 Oh, just one more song! Anyone? How about a dance contest? I know you love to cut a rug, so how 'bout we mess up a cave floor? I have a brilliant idea! Hide and seek! Who's with me?
30600a [yawns] Maybe tomorrow.
306065 Aww.
306008 Seems like you don't really wanna go to sleep tonight. Is there some reason why?
306065 Pfft, of course not! I just love camping and hanging out with Rainbow Dash so much that I don't wanna waste a single minute with sleep! [yawns] Heh, silly sleep.
30600c That's cool and all, Scoot, but this pony needs her shut-eye and she needs it now!
306065 Ugh, this is so unfair... [yawns] I'm falling asleep... [snores]
306000 [water dripping]
306000 [hoofsteps]
306000 [vehicle accelerating]
306065 [gasps] If The Headless Horse catches me, I'm never gonna be heard from again! And I wanna be heard from! Woah, woaaah! Ugh! [grunts] Woah!
306000 [running hoofsteps]
306065 It's all over! [cries hysterically]
306065 [panting] Aaah!
30601a [echoing] A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo.
306000 [poof]
306065 Princess Luna! I thought you were The Headless Horse!
30601a You were mistaken, but I hope not disappointed.
306065 You are so, so much better than The Headless Horse. But what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in Canterlot?
30601a I am the princess of the night. Thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
306065 Oh, yeah... Wait, is this just a dream? But it feels so real!
306000 [reverberating drumbeat]
30601a I assure you that you are asleep. But when you awake, the thing that frightens you most will still exist.
306065 [nervously] Eh... The Headless Horse?
30601a Hmmm... Is The Headless Horse really what frightens you the most?
306065 Mm-mm. I'm afraid Rainbow Dash will find out I'm not as tough as she thinks I am.
30601a Everypony has fears, Scootaloo. Everypony must face them in their own way. But they must be faced, or the nightmares will continue.
306065 [nervous whine]
306000 [rocks tumbling]
30601a Face your fears!
306065 –Princess Luna?! [sighs] It was just a dream.
306000 [water dripping]
306065 [gasps] But The Headless Horse isn't! Rainbow Dash said it lives here, in these very woods!
306000 [distant whinnying]
306065 It's the wicked whinny of The Headless Horse! [wings motoring]
30600c [whinny-like snoring]
306065 [panting] So it's a horse without a head... which means it doesn't have a mouth... and if it doesn't have a mouth, then... it's not a horse-eat-pony kind of horse... but still... it's a horse without a head!
306000 [tires screeching]
306065 Whoa, whoa! [whining]
306000 [river rushing]
306000 [splash]
306065 Hello?! Is anyone out there? [nervously] Anyone except The Headless Horse?
306000 [branch cracking]
306065 Heellllp–
306000 [splash]
306065 [gasps for breath]
306000 [splashing]
306065 [screams, fades out]
306000 [whoosh]
30600c I gotcha!
306065 Rainbow Dash! Is that you? Thank you, thank you!
30600c What were you doing out here in the middle of the night?!
30601a [echoing] It is time for you to face your real fear, Scootaloo!
306065 [sighs] I'm so, so sorry, Rainbow Dash! I just wanted you to hang out with me and see how cool I was so you'd take me under your wing, teach me everything you know, and become like my big sister! [takes breath] But then you started telling those spooky stories and I got scared! I thought I heard The Headless Horse so I ran out here by myself, and... [crying] ...well, I guess you know the rest. [sniffling]
30600c Hey, I'm gonna tell you something, but if you ever tell anypony else, I'm gonna deny it. First time I heard those stories... I was scared too.
306065 [sniffles] You were?
30600c Sure! I mean, I got over it because I realized pretty quick that if there was such thing as a Headless Horse, I could totally take it on. So, you're looking for somepony to take you under their wing, huh?
306065 Mm-hmm.
30600c Yeah, I might be up for something like that.
306065 Really?
30600c As long as you don't go falling into any more rivers in the middle of the night.
306065 [giggles] It's a deal!
306000 [waterfalls rushing]
306066 I call sister teams! Last pair to make it to the falls is a moldy carrot!
30600d Ugh, if you insist. [giggles] It is so on!
30600c They think they can beat the two of us?
306065 [wings fluttering]
3061d2 [grumbling] Who's got my rusty horseshoe?
30600c Here it is, for pony's sake. Now take it and stop all your moaning.
3061d2 Thank you, and have a nice day.
30601a [chuckles]

306000 [credits]
30700d [sipping]
307007 Ooooh, I wish the mailpony would just come already! I can't wait another minute to find out if Rainbow Dash got in or not!
307003 Pinkie Pie, you're more nervous than Rainbow Dash.
30700c I'm not nervous at all. When I get into the Wonderbolt Academy...
307007 IF you get in! If you get in! Don't jinx it!
30700c I'm telling you, it's in the bag.
307007 Don't jinx it!
307008 She is the best flyer in Ponyville.
30700c In Ponyville? I'm probably the best flyer in all of Equestria. I wouldn't be surprised if they just went ahead and made me a Wonderbolt on the first day.
3071d4 Got a letter here for Rainbow Dash.
30700c I... didn't get in.
307007 [gasp]
30700c Gotcha! Ha, you guys are so gullible. Like I wasn't gonna get in!
307007 I'm just sooooooooooo happy for you!
30700c Uh... thanks?
307007 [squeals]
30700c Pinkie Pie? I kinda need to get going.
307007 Okay. I'm done!
30700c The sooner I get there, the sooner I get to show 'em my stuff! See you guys in a week!
307008 Good luck!
30700c Won't need it!
307000 [megaphone feedback]
307007 DON'T FORGET TO WRITE! Do you think she heard me?
307000 [theme song]
307000 [Pegasi chattering]
30700c Oh, yeah! This is gonna be sweet!
30707c Well, lookie what we got here. Bet y'all think you're Wonderbolt material, don't ya?
3071d5 Yes, ma'am!
30707c Think you got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
3071d5 Yes, ma'am!
30707c Well then. Let me be the first to tell you... You don't! If you had what it took to be an elite flyer, you'd already be a Wonderbolt! Still think you're something special?
3071d7 No, ma'am!
30707c [to Bulk Biceps] Ya think you're hot stuff? [to Rainbow Dash] You look like you're the worst flyer in the whole academy! You'll probably quit after the first day!
30700c No, ma'am! I'd never quit, ma'am!
30707c Ha. What about you? Bet you couldn't fly past the first flagpole without getting winded.
3071d6 Try me, ma'am.
30707c What's that?
3071d6 Let me show you what I've got, ma'am.
30707c Ah. You want a chance to prove yourself, huh?
3071d6 Yes, ma'am!
30707c Well then, now's your chance. Give me five hundred laps! All of you!
307000 [Pegasi moan]
30707c Now! [blows whistle]
307000 [Pegasi cough]
30707c Lap four-hundred and ninety-nine!
30700c One more lap to go!
3071d6 You're on!
30707c Five hundred!
307000 [screech]
30707c Not bad... for a couple of newbies.
3071d6 Name's Lightning Dust.
30700c Rainbow Dash!
3071d6 Wanna grab some grub in the mess hall?
30700c Definitely.
307000 [mailbox door creaking]
307008 Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash hasn't even been gone twenty-four hours yet. Give her a chance to settle in first. Why don't we just go see what Twilight's up to? I hear Princess Celestia's got her workin' on some new spells!
307007 New spells, huh? Okay. Wait! If I'm not here when Rainbow Dash's letter arrives, I won't be able to read it right away. And if I don't read it right away, I won't be able to write her back right away. And if I don't write her back right away, she might think I didn't get her letter, and then she might worry it got lost. And if she's worrying about her letter, she'll be distracted. And if she's distracted, then she won't do well at the academy! And if she doesn't do well at the academy, then she'll get kicked out! And if she gets kicked out, they'll never let her be a Wonderbolt! And if she doesn't get to be a Wonderbolt, all her dreams will be crushed! And it will be all... my... fault! [thud]
307008 So in other words, you're stickin' by the mailbox.
307007 Yep!
307008 Suit yourself.
307000 [mailbox door creaking]
30707c The Wonderbolts are the fastest, best precision flyers in the world. But spin-outs can still happen. And when they do, a Wonderbolt must be able to recover quickly. This... is the Dizzitron. It's gonna make you very – I repeat – very dizzy. Your task is to try and recover and fly straight again, as soon as possible. Once you have recovered you must come in for a smooth landing. Now, who's first? [to Meadow Flower] You. You're up.
3071d8 Me? [gulps]
30707c Now! Ready?
3071d8 Yes, ma'am!
30707c Go!
307000 [Dizzitron spinning]
30707c Release!
3071d8 [groaning]
30707c Huh. Fifteen seconds. Decent, but I wouldn't go writin' home about it! Who's next? Alright, Rainbow Dash. Let's see what you got.
30700c Yes, ma'am!
30707c Okay, go!
307000 [Dizzitron spinning]
30707c Release! Six seconds? That's an academy record.
3071d8 You made it look so easy.
30700c I make everything look easy.
30707c Okay, Lightning Dust. You're up.
3071d6 Ma'am, can you put the Dizzitron at maximum speed? I wanna push my limits.
30707c You sure about that?
3071d6 Yes ma'am.
30707c Okay. You asked for it.
307000 [Dizzitron spinning rapidly]
30707c Release! Six point five seconds. Not bad.
3071d9 Heh!/Oh yeah!
30707c Next!
307000 [off-screen crash]
30700c No pony even came close to six seconds.
3071d6 They should make us Wonderbolts right now.
30700c Yeah, they should.
30707c Listen up! For the rest of the camp, you'll be working in pairs. 'Morrow morning, I'll post the teams, including who'll be lead pony and who'll be wingpony. Good luck.
3071d6 Like we're going to need it.
30700c Heh, yeah.
30700c So, which one of you lucky gals gets to be my wingpony? What?
3071d7 Eh, you might want to check the wall.
30700c A wingpony?
3071d6 They made us a team! Isn't that awesome?
307000 [door opens]
30700c Permission to enter, ma'am.
30707c What is it, Rainbow Dash?
30700c I had the best time on the Dizzitron! Only six seconds!
30707c And?
30700c And you made me a wingpony!
30707c Because I believe you and Lightning Dust will be an unstoppable team. Do you not think you'll be an unstoppable team?
30700c Yes, ma'am! I mean no, ma'am! I mean... We'll be an unstoppable team, ma'am.
30707c Then what's the problem?
30700c I think I should be lead pony, ma'am.
30707c And I think Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony. Got it?
30700c Yes, ma'am.
30707c Good.
30707c Today you will all be participating in a flag hunt. We'll divide you into two teams, red... and blue. Whoever finds the most flags of the opposing team's color wins.
307000 [Pegasi cheering]
3071d8 Oh, this is gonna be so much fun!
30707c If you think this is gonna be fun, you are sadly mistaken. This is for training purposes. This is not recess. Lead ponies and wingponies must fly together. If any pair splits apart, they will be immediately disqualified. Do you understand?
3071d5 Yes, ma'am!
30707c Then let's go! [blows whistle]
3071d6 Ready to rock and roll?
30700c Ready.
3071d6 You spotted any flags yet?
30700c Not yet. Oh! There's one!
3071d6 Good eyes!
30700c We should slow down. It doesn't look like both of us can make it at this speed!
3071d6 Peh.
30700c Ow!
30707c Lightning Dust and Rainbow Dash found the first flag!
3071d6 Come on! Let's find some more!
30700c Uh, sure. Just give me a second.
3071d6 Oh, you're fine.
30700c Yeah... totally. [groans]
307007 [snore] [gasp]
307000 [mailbox door creaks]
30700d She's still at it.
30700e I just wish we could help her.
307007 Help me? The only thing that could possibly help me right now is a letter from Rainbow Dash! It's been three days already. By now, she probably doesn't even know our names anymore! She probably can't remember our faces! "Pinkie Pie? I never heard of a Pinkie Pie! Who is Pinkie Pie?"
307003 Well, if you're so worried, then why don't you send her a letter first?
307007 Of course! That's a great idea!
3071da [sigh of relief]
307007 Oh wait! I got an even better idea! How about we send Rainbow Dash a care package? You know, before she forgets all about us? Although, come on, let's face it. It's probably too late for that. But, uh, maybe it'll jog her memory somehow.
307003 Pinkie Pie, I'm sure Rainbow Dash still remembers our faces and who we are. But I think sending her a care package is a great idea.
307007 A care package it is! We'll send it through the mail! WAIT! Ah! That won't work at all!
307008 Why not?
307007 Because what if the package gets lost in the mail? What if somepony else gets the package by accident and then she remembers us instead of Rainbow Dash and then she becomes our new friend? And then the real Rainbow Dash won't ever know that she used to have friends and she forgot them!
307008 Is anypony else followin' this?
3071db Mmm-mm.
307007 I've got it! We'll deliver the care package to Rainbow Dash in person!
30700d I wouldn't mind a little trip.
307003 I'll go!
307008 Count me in!
30700e Me too.
307007 Me five! But don't be upset if she doesn't recognize you at first. It may take a while for her to get her memory back.
307000 [trumpet fanfare]
30707c Today we'll be doing our famous air obstacle course.
307000 [cloud spouts bursting]
30707c The object of this exercise is to work on your precision flying under extreme circumstances. And don't worry about winning. It's not a race. Now everypony, get on your marks!
307000 [whistle blows]
307000 [cloud spouts bursting]
3071d6 Ugh! Can't they go any faster? It's no good, I can't get around them!
30700c Doesn't matter! We can still fly completely in sync and blow Spitfire's mind with our moves!
3071d6 I guess...
307000 [rain falling]
3071d6 What are they, a couple of snails? It's just a little weather.
307000 [lightning strikes]
3071d6 Now's our chance to pass these slowpokes!
307000 [Pegasi screaming]
307000 [screech]
30707c Not bad! And in record time, too! Definitely made the right decision making you two a team. The others seem to have had a little trouble with the precision part of the exercise. I'd better go help sort them out. Why don't you two go hit the mess hall early?
3071d6 Yes, ma'am!
30700c Thank you, ma'am. Um, Lightning Dust? Next time, maybe we don't cut the other teams off like that.
3071d6 Hey, you snooze, you lose! Besides, Wonderbolts are supposed to be able to recover from a spin-out. You saw them on the Dizzitron! They could use the practice. I mean, it's not our fault we're so much better than those other guys! Not every pony is destined to become a Wonderbolt. Only the best of the best, right?
30700c Yeah, I-I guess you're right...
3071d6 'Course I'm right! Now let's go fuel up! Kicking all that tail has made me hungry.
307000 [whistle blows]
307000 [cloud punching]
30717b [chomp] Yeah!
3071d6 I have an idea about how we can literally blow away our competition.
30717b [growl]
30700c But we're already way ahead.
3071d6 Are you in or not?
30707c [echoing] Lightning Dust likes to push herself a little harder than you do. That's why I made her lead pony.
30700c I'm in!
3071d6 Then follow my lead!
307000 [tornado blowing]
3071d6 I can't control it!
307008 It's a twister!
307003 Hold on!
30711a [scream]
30700c Noooooo!
30711a [screams] Huh?
30700c Are you guys okay?
3071dc Uh-huh.
30700c Pinkie Pie!
307007 You... remember me!
30700c Well... yeah, of course I remember you. But... what are you all doing here?
307008 We wanted to bring you a care package. Didn't realize you'd be in the middle of some crazy tornado drill.
3071d6 That... was... awesome!
30700c Awesome? My friends could have been smashed to pieces!
3071d6 Yeah, but they weren't, right? Can't say the same for the clouds. We totally wiped them out with that tornado. The other cadets will have to be up there for days to bust as many as we did.
30700c A hoof bump? Seriously? You made me clip my wing. You sent half of our class into serious tailspins on the obstacle course. You unleashed a tornado that nearly demolished my friends!
3071d6 Yeah, and?
30700c And I get that you want to be the best. So do I! But you're going about it in the wrong way.
3071d6 The Wonderbolts don't seem to think so. After all, Spitfire did make me the leader and you the wingpony.
30700c [sigh] You're right. She did.
307000 [door opens]
30707c This better be important. You're supposed to be up there busting clouds with your partner.
30700c We're done with that, ma'am.
30707c Already? That's an academy record! Explain your methods.
30700c That's why I'm here, ma'am. Lightning Dust decided to use a tornado.
30707c A bit excessive for cloud-busting. But judging from your time, it was obviously an effective tactic.
30700c Yeah, well that "effective tactic" nearly took out my friends! No disrespect, ma'am, but there's a big difference between pushing yourself as hard as you can and just being reckless. And if being reckless is what gets rewarded around here, if that's what it means to be a Wonderbolt, then I don't want any part of it.
30707c What are you saying, newbie?
30700c I quit.
307000 [door closes]
307008 You did what?!
30700d Being a Wonderbolt was your dream!
30700c Not anymore.
307003 I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I know how much this meant to you.
30707c Rainbow Dash! How dare you storm out of my office without giving me a chance to respond! The Wonderbolts are looking for the best flyers in Equestria, but you were right. Being the best should never come at the expense of our fellow ponies. It's not just about pushing ourselves; it's about pushing ourselves in the right direction. You've shown that you're capable of doing just that. You're no wingpony, Rainbow Dash. You're a leader.
30700c OhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygoshOhmygosh!
30707c Now get out there and give me twenty!
30700c Yes, ma'am!
307007 Wait! You didn't even get to open your care package!
307000 [music]
307000 [credits]
308008 Ha! Found 'em!
308009 Aaa-choooo!
308008 Heh. Gesundhoof.
308009 Why, thank you, Applejack. I still can't believe it's been almost one hundred moons since our last family reunion. Aw, I remember it like it was yesterday.
308008 Well, you have been talkin' about it pretty much every day since then.
308009 Apple Bloom! How them RSVPs comin' along? Who's showin' their muzzle at the reunion?
30800a Everypony!
308009 Everypony? Feathers on a goat. Are you sure?
30800a Well, I got RSVPs from Apples from Yonder Hill, Hollow Shades, Galloping Gorge, Foal Mountain, Apples from Fillydelphia, Tall Tale Town, and all the Apples from Appleloosa!
308009 Guh?
30800a Oh! And how could I forget? Manehattan! Babs is comin'! I get to see my favorite cousin!
308009 I think we're gonna need a bigger cider trough.
308000 [theme song]
308009 Whooeee! Looks like the family's grown tenfold since the last reunion! I'm gonna be busier than a worm in a rotten tomater tryin' to get everything ready!
308008 I could always help out.
30800a Me, too!
308026 Eeyup.
308009 Oh, I sure would appreciate that. Granny's a little rustier in the giddy-up since the last time the Apples all got together.
308008 You may be a tad old, Granny, but you're as feisty and full of spark as ever–
308009 Who you callin' old?!
308008 Uh... I just meant... Why don't you let me take over puttin' the reunion together this time 'round? Then all you need to worry about is enjoyin' yourself.
308009 Hmmm. Alright, young'un, you got yourself a deal. You are in charge.
308008 I won't let you down, Granny. You just tell me what the reunion needs, and I'll take care of the rest.
308009 I'll do better than tell you what the reunion'll need. I'll show ya!
308009 We've been hostin' these things at Sweet Apple Acres every hundred moons since we first planted roots here in Ponyville.
30800a Hey, who's that?
308009 That'd be your Great-Great-Auntie Applesauce when she was just about your age. Now, she used to go by another name, but everypony started calling her Applesauce after half her teeth fell out when she was makin' apple jam. Yeah. Never did find them teeth in all those jars.
30800a Hey! That's you, Granny!
308009 Sure is. Apple family's been workin' on that same old quilt since our first reunion.
3081dd I can do it! Ngh! Oh, fingle-fangle!
308000 [ponies laughing]
30800a [giggling]
308009 Well, nopony told me you actually had to knot the end of the thread!
30800a [giggling]
308008 Okay, so I'll need to get new quiltin' materials, fabric, needles, thread... You've really been workin' on the same quilt since the first reunion?
308009 Surely have. I don't think we're ever gonna finish that doggone thing!
30800a Hey, what's goin' on here?
308009 Well, you know us Apples enjoy a good fritter...
308000 [splat]
3081de [licking lips] [munches] Ooo, hot hot hot!
308000 [firetruck's bell ringing]
308000 [apple cider splashes]
308000 [plate clinking]
3081df Hey, where did all them apple fritters go?
3081e0 [munches]
3081df And...
3081e0 [baby noises]
3081df Who are you, little one?
3081e0 I'm Applejack! More apple fwitter?
308009 That's how we figured out your sister had the appetite of a full-grown stallion.
308008 Better get twice as much honey and flour, then... fifty more buckets of apples... more oil... wood for the fire...
308009 Now, stick an apple in my mouth and roast my rump! This one sure brings back memories. Y'know how Babs is your favorite cousin? Well, Apple Rose is mine. The two of us entered the seven-legged race every reunion!
3081e1 We're gonna win this one, cousin!
3081dd You bet your hot-diggety-derriere we are! C'mon, cousin, speed'er on up!
3081e1 [yelps] [laughs]
3081e2 [laughing]
308009 Never won a single one of them races.
308008 Races. We'll need cloth ties, finish line... Not much to a seven-legged race. Hmm...
308009 And, of course, we can't forget to take the big family photo! We always snapped a photo in front of the barn at the end of every reunion, lets us see how our family's grown!
308008 Photo in front of the barn. Got it.
30800a You sure have some great memories of these reunions, don'tcha?
308009 Indeedy, and I'm lookin' forward to makin' more at this one. Oh, I'm sure everypony is, and I do mean everypony! We got the whole family together this time 'round! Who knows if they'll all be able to make the next one?
308008 That's true! Busy as everypony's lives are gettin' these days, chances are pretty slim we'll be this lucky next time 'round. Don't worry, Granny, I'm gonna make sure this is the most memorable reunion we've ever had! I'd better get started... I've got some plannin' to do!
308009 Oh, hootenanny! Would you look what your second cousin is wearin' on her head?
3081e3 [giggling]
308000 [clock pendulum ticking]
30800a [groans]
308008 Apple Bloom! What are you doin' up?
30800a I was gonna ask you the same thing.
308008 I can't sleep. My gears are turnin' in my head about this reunion!
30800a [yawning] Yeah... I can't wait to see my cousin Babs. We're gonna do so many fun things together...
308008 Fun? That's just the beginnin' of it! Granny Smith handed me the reins of this reunion, and I'm gonna make the most of it. Apple Bloom, I've got so many things planned you won't even have a minute's rest!
30800a [snoring]
308008 Trust me, little sis. This reunion I'm puttin' together is gonna be worth the wait.
30800a [snoring]
308000 [rooster crows]
30800a [snoring] Whoa!
308008 Rise and shine! We don't have much time!
308000 [thump]
308000 [dragging sounds]
308000 [bucking trees, apples falling]
308000 [bees buzzing]
308007 [belches] Don't forget the glitter!
308008 [coughs]
308000 [rain falling]
308000 [lightning cracking]
30800c [whistling]
308005 [clicking noises] [breathes fire]
308008 H-ah. Think that'll do it!
308009 And just in time, too.
308000 [rumbling]
308008 They're here!
308000 [ponies shouting]
308009 Apple Rose! Ohhh! Ooh, this is more excitin' than when it rained frogs!
308000 [microphone feedback]
308008 [through megaphone] Howdy, y'all, and welcome to the Apple family reunion!
308000 [ponies cheering]
308008 [through megaphone] My name's Applejack, and I just want to let y'all know that I got a real big day planned for ya! We're gonna start off with an obstacle course for the young'uns, and some fritter makin' and quiltin' for the not-so-young'uns. And there's lots more to come after that! Hope y'all enjoy it!
308000 [ponies cheering]
30800a Where is she?
3081c4 [blows]
30800a Babs!
3081c4 Cuz!
30800a I know it hasn't been that long since we've seen each other, but–
3081e4 –It felt like forever!
3081c4 I can't wait to tell you about my new school!
30800a I can't wait to hear all about it!
3081c4 Jeepers, where do I start? Okay. So first day–
308008 Babs! Huh, so glad you could come!
3081c4 What am I, gonna miss out on spendin' time with my favorite cousin? Forget about it! [blows]
308008 Why don't you two head over to the obstacle course?
30800a We kinda wanna catch up a little bit first...
308008 Don't you worry. There'll be plenty of time for family bondin' while you're racin' against your other cousins.
308008 Alrighty, ponies! Ready to have some fun?
3081c4 Whoa, is that the finish line? It's like a mile away or somethin'!
308008 Actually, that's just the marker where you go on to the next leg of the race.
30800a There's more?
308008 Much more. Trust me, I have put together somethin' you are never gonna forget. After the seven-legged race, you're gonna wanna hurry up and head over here, where you'll be bobbin' for apples!
308000 [splash]
308008 Then you'll run around these trees fifty times until you're real good and dizzy. Then you'll jump these big wooden hurdles. And then there's the final leg, where you'll balance plates on your head while sayin' "Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets" over and over and over again. Last pony standin' wins!
308000 [pause]
30800a Seriously?
308008 Seriously! C'mon, y'all! Let's start makin' some memories! On your mark... get set... go!
308008 Whooeee! Lookin' good, everypony! Ooh, better go check on the quilt.
308009 How long you had those new chompers, Auntie Applesauce?
3081e5 A lady never reveals the age of her teeth.
3081e6 Ugh.
3081e5 Don't you roll your eyes at me, Miss Apple Rose! I imagine you two think I have forgotten what you did to my parasol six reunions ago?
308009 [giggles] We were just usin' it to help break open that piñata!
3081e7 [laughing]
3081e5 Applejack, delightful to see you. Are you gonna join us in some quiltin'?
308008 Sorry, Auntie Applesauce, I am busy-busy-busy. Y'all should get started, though!
308009 We couldn't find our rocking chairs.
308008 I got rid of 'em to make room for these. This is the year y'all are finally gonna finish that quilt!
3081e6 Finish it?
308000 [engine starting]
308000 [very loud sewing machine rattling]
308000 [Auntie Applesauce's teeth chattering]
308008 [over noise] Won't that be excitin'?
3081e6 [over noise] What's that?
308008 [over noise] I said, won't that be–
308000 [rattling stops]
308008 –excitin'?
3081e5 I suppose, although I have been told that too much excitement can wreak havoc on this youthful complexion of mine.
3081e6 Oh.
308009 [giggling]
308000 [rattling restarts]
308008 [over noise] That's the spirit!
308009 [over noise] What did she say?
3081e6 [over noise] What?
308009 [over noise] Good gracious!
3081e6 [over noise] Golden Delicious? I think he's racing with his cousin!
308000 [dizzy music]
3081c4 [dizzy] How are Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle?
30800a [dizzy] Great! Ugh...
3081c4 [dizzy] You alright?
30800a [dizzy] So... dizzy... [Wilhelm scream]
308000 [crash]
30800a Ugh...
3081c4 [sigh]
308000 [splat]
308026 [sniffs] [licks lips] [gulps] [whistles innocently]
3081e8 You've got eight now, dont'cha?
3081e9 Oh, sure do. Tell you what, my Apple Tart may just be a baby, but he is a hoot!
308008 Havin' fun?
3081e9 Sure are!
308008 Better pick up the pace on those fritters though, huh? Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Roll, fold, crimp, slide to the left. Now you try! That's it! Gotta keep this assembly line movin', gals! We want every Apple here to get a chance to taste the best darn fritters in Equestria!
3081e4 Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.
30800a Any other blank flanks at your new school?
3081c4 Yeah. Two.
3081e4 Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.
30800a Do they wanna be Crusaders?
3081c4 Totally!
30800a Great!
3081e4 Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets. Pappy pony picked a pluck of prickly pluffnuggets.
3081c4 Ah can' thfeel my tongue.
30800a Neh nehber.
308008 [through megaphone] Alright, Apples, break!
308000 [sewing machine rattling stops]
30800a [sighs] Finally...
308008 Ooh, can't forget to capture all these memories for Granny's album! Huh. Nothin' all that memorable there. Or there. Or there. C'mon, Applejack, think. You gotta kick this thing up a notch! Hm...
30800a I get that my big sis wants this to be like a super-awesome reunion, but that was ridiculous!
3081c4 I thought we'd never get a minute to just hang out!
308008 And your minute's up! Your fellow Apples are waitin' for you to join them.
30800a Applejack, I haven't had any time with Babs! We were so busy with that obstacle course, we didn't even get to talk!
308008 There'll be plenty of time to bond with Babs when we do the hayride.
3081c4 Hayride?
308008 Alright, everypony! Step right up, take a seat, and leave the drivin' to these stallions! Now, I know y'all've been workin' real hard makin' some awesome memories. And in all of our past reunions, we always had a nice and relaxin' hayride around the farm. Which is why I decided to change things up a bit, and try somethin' just a wee bit more excitin'. So let's get this show on the road! Giddy-up!
3081ea [whinnying]
30800f Whoa!
308000 [crunch]
308000 [Auntie Applesauce's teeth chattering]
308000 [chomp]
3081e5 [teethless] I just had those professionally polished.
308009 Where in the world does that girl have us headed? The west orchard?
308026 Eeyup.
308009 What?! I was jokin'! Why, we haven't tended those fields since all the trees went and got filled up with... [gulps]
308000 [thunk]
308000 [fruit bats squeaking]
308000 [ponies oohing and ahhing]
3081c4 Wowza! Never seen real fruit bats before!
308000 [fruit bat licking lips]
308000 [aeroplane engine noises]
308008 Uh-oh.
3081e5 [yelps]
308000 [ponies yelping]
30800a Everypony! Jump out!!
308000 [crash]
308008 [crying] Ruined. Everythin' is ruined.
308000 [crunch]
308008 Oh, Granny. I'm so, so sorry.
308009 Oh, it's alright, child.
308008 But it's not alright. Just look at this! The barn and all my plans for the perfect family reunion are completely destroyed!
30800a Maybe that's a good thing.
308008 How can that possibly be a good thing?
308009 Applejack, you had us so caught up in all the doin', we haven't had a second to enjoy the company of the folks we've been doin' it with!
308008 Really?
308000 [ponies agreeing]
308008 [sighs] Oh, Granny Smith, here you let me be in charge of creatin' great memories, and the only thing anypony's gonna remember about this reunion... is that it was the worst one we ever had.
308009 Oh, hey now... everypony's still here, ain't they? Still plenty of time to make good memories! You've just got to give everypony a chance to actually make 'em.
308008 The family photo! Guess we can't take it in front of the barn this year... unless... Everypony! I have one more activity!
308009 Applejack...
308008 Trust me, Granny Smith. This'll be one we'll remember for all the right reasons.
308008 [Applejack]
308008 Yee-hoo!
308008 Raise this barn, raise this barn
308008 One, two, three, four
308008 Together, we can raise this barn
308008 One, two, three, four
308008 Up, up, up, go the beams
308008 Hammer those joints, work in teams
308008 Turn 'em round quick by the right elbow
308008 Grab a new partner, here we go
30800b Yeah!
308008 Come on, Apple family! Let's get to it! Wee-hoo!

308008 Together, we can raise this barn
308008 One, two, three, four
308008 Slats of wood come off the ground
308008 Hold 'em up and nail 'em down
308008 Turn 'em round quick by the left elbow
308008 Grab a new partner, here we go
30800b Yeah!
308008 Come on, Apples! Get 'er done!
30800a [Apple Bloom]
30800a Look at us, we're family
308008 [Applejack]
308008 Workin' together thankfully
30800a [Apple Bloom]
30800a We Apples, we are proud to say
308000 [Applejack and Apple Bloom]
308000 Stick together the pony way
308008 [Applejack]
308008 Bow to your partner, circle right
308008 Get down if you're scared of heights
308008 Forward back and twirl around
308008 That barn's gonna be the best in town
30800b Yeah!
308008 Yee-haw! Attagirl!
30800a Alright, let's get to it!
30800b [Apple family]
30800b Raise this barn, raise this barn

30800b One, two, three, four

30800b Yes, we did

30800b Yes, we did
30800b Being together counts the most
30800b We all came here from coast to coast
30800b All we need to strive to be
30800b Is part of the Apple family
30800a Yeah!
308009 Oh!
3081eb [laughing]
30800a I can't wait for the next reunion!
3081c4 Me neither!
30800a I mean, obviously we have to get together before then!
3081c4 [chuckles] Obviously.
308009 Oh, you did it, Applejack! You put on a reunion that everypony will remember!
308008 Just had a couple minor hiccups along the way.
308009 Yeah, just a couple.
308009 Ohohoh, that's a good one.
3081e3 [laughing]
30800a Oh!
308008 Dear Princess Celestia,
308008 Today I learned a great lesson about family, which, if you think about it, is really the first group of friends you ever make. Turns out that when you're with folks you care about, you don't have to do much to make that time memorable. Even the simplest of activities can take on a whole lotta meanin'! And you'll find that you'll remember the "who" long after you've forgotten the "what".
308008 Your humble subject,
308008 Applejack
308000 [music]
308000 [credits]
309005 Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
309003 Huh. That's not that many.
309005 Are you kidding? How are you supposed to read twelve books in one weekend?
309003 Princess Celestia obviously thinks I can or she would never have assigned them to me. I'm not planning on letting her down.
309005 Well, I hope you're not planning on sleeping then, either.
309003 Actually, Spike, why don't you take the day off?
309005 Really?
309003 Why not? These books are gonna keep me busy for a while.
309005 Hmm... I do have a long list of things I've been dying to do!
309005 "Touch nose with tongue." Eeeng... done! "Play bongos on my belly."
309000 [bongo drum sounds]
309005 Done! "Smell my dirty feet." [sniffs] [sigh] Done! Huh, that didn't take nearly as long as I thought it would.
309000 [theme song]
309005 What to do, what to do...
309000 [cat yowling]
309005 [gasps] A hot air balloon ride!
309000 [thump]
309005 [gasps] Oh no! Wait! Runaway balloon! Gah!
309000 [boing]
309005 [groans] Sorry!
309000 [wheels rattling noisily]
309005 [yelps]
309000 [screeching]
309005 [relieved sigh] That was a close one. I-if I didn't know better, I would swear that I was in the middle of the dark and scary Everfree Forest.
309000 [twig snaps]
309005 [yelps] What was that?! C'mon, Spike. Just because this forest is full of wild dangerous animals, doesn't mean that you're gonna see one! Hehe...[sniffs] [grunts]
309000 [timberwolves growling]
309005 [screams]
309000 [timberwolves barking]
309008 Come 'n' get me, ya big goons! [to Spike] Run!
309005 I'm running! I'm running!
309000 [barking]
309005 [yelping]
309008 Whew!
309005 Wow, Applejack! That was amazing! I mean, you rocketed those boulders at them like they were... rockets! Pow, pow, pow pow pow! You saved my life! [softly] You... saved... my life.
309008 Aw, don't mention it, Spike. C'mon, we should be headin' on back, now.
309005 Man, am I lucky you were out here. Uh, why were you out here?
309008 Saw the balloon floatin' by with nopony in it, came out here to investigate. Guess you did too, huh?
309005 Uh... yeah... I was investigating the runaway hot air balloon too! So, uh, now that the mystery's been solved, let's get outta here, huh?
309000 [distant howling]
309008 Thanks for walkin' me home, Spike. That was mighty kind of you. But now I have chores that need tendin' to, so see you later.
309005 What chores? I'll do them!
309008 That's sweet, but you don't have–
309005 It's the least I can do! You saved my life! I need to repay the favor.
309008 Shoot, Spike, that's what friends do for each other. You don't need to repay the favor.
309005 Yes, I do!
309008 Sugar, it's okay, it's not necessary.
309005 Applejack, you don't understand! This is something I really need to do!
309008 Well, I'd hate to get in the way of doin' somethin' you need to do...
309005 Great! What should I do?
309008 Uh... Apple Bloom's over yonder givin' little Piggington a bath. I was gonna lend her a hoof, but maybe you could lend her one instead.
309005 On the double!
309005 Applejack said I could help you!
309000 [pig snorts]
30900a Great! I could use all the help I can get!
309000 [thud]
309005 Heh, wait 'til Applejack sees how you sparkle!
309000 [pig squealing]
309005 Ta-da!
309000 [pig oinks]
309008 Good job, you two.
30900a Applejack, is it okay if I get goin'? I don't wanna be late for my Crusaders meeting. We're gettin' fitted for water skis!
309008 Heh, you definitely don't wanna be late for that.
30900a Water skiin' cutie mark, here I come!
309008 Spike, you can head on out too. I reckon you have repaid me in full so we are officially even Steven.
309005 What? Ohhh no. We aren't even close to being even Steven! Please, Applejack, you must allow me to assist you further!
309008 I dunno, Spike. Just don't feel right to have you, uh, doin' things for me.
309005 Please?
309008 Really, you don't–
309005 Pretty please?
309008 It's just not necessary–
309005 Pretty pretty pretty please?
309008 [sigh] Oh, all right. You can help Granny Smith and me bake some–
309005 Pies! Pies! I'm helping Applejack make some pies!
309009 Uh, Spike, little feller, could you get us some more eggs?
309005 Coming right up! [sounds of exertion]
309000 [crash]
309005 Uh, oops, sorry, Applejack. Lemme get something to clean that up!
309000 [thud, splash]
309000 [poof]
309000 [splat]
309008 [sighs] Appreciate all your help today, sugarcube, but... I can take it from here.
309005 Don't be ridiculous! It is my honor and my duty! Today's just the beginning!
309008 What's that now?
309005 You saved my life! [belches] According to the "Spike the Dragon Code", I owe you a life debt and must serve you.
309009 Now, what about Twilight? Doesn't she need your help and such?
309005 [breathes fire] Huh, you're right. I better break the news to Twilight. I just hope she doesn't take it too hard... Be right back!
309000 [splat]
309005 Come on, Spike, this is your personal, moral, ethical dragon code we're talking about! You have to do this! It's not like you and Twilight won't be friends anymore... but it won't be the same... but it has to be done. [to Twilight] Twilight, Applejack just saved my life from horrible, dragon-eating timberwolves!
309003 Mm-hmm...
309005 And, as you are aware, I adhere to my dragon code, and this means I must serve her for the rest of my natural born days! I'm sure you understand.
309003 Mm-hmm...
309005 It's... been an honor... being your faithful assistant.
309003 Sounds good.
309005 [sighs]
309005 She said it was okay.
3091ec Really?
309005 So, with Twilight's blessing, I'm free to follow my code and serve you until–
309000 [crash]
309005 Well, until forever!
309008 Listen, sugarcube, I completely respect your "dragon code"... Truly I do, but I just can't cotton with you permanently servin' me.
309005 Please, Applejack, my dragon code is a part of me! I have to be true to myself! If you don't let me do this, I won't be a noble dragon anymore!
309008 Oh, well, I can't have you feelin' like you're not a noble dragon now, can I?
309005 Great! Then from here on in, your wish is my command.
309000 [pause]
309008 Oh, uh, okay... I would like you to... hmm... huh... oh! ...Help me take some of the pie you made to...
309005 Rarity?
309008 Uh, sure, why not?
309005 I helped bake it.
30900d Eugh. [chewing]
309005 You even look good when you're chewing... [laughs nervously] W-who looks good when they're chewing?
30900d [spits]
309005 Aren't you gonna have some more?
30900d I... had a big lunch!
309005 It's ten in the morning.
30900d Breakfast. A big breakfast.
309005 Ohhh. Okay.
309008 Maybe you could take her plate back to the kitchen and wash it off?
309005 As you wish!
30900d What was that all about?
309008 [sighs] I saved Spike from some timberwolves in the Everfree Forest, and now he thinks he has to serve me forever.
30900d [delighted squeal] Oh, what I wouldn't give to have somepony forever in my debt! I'd get them to organize my closets, and give me pedicures, and help me with my sewing and–
309008 Okay, I get it, havin' somepony to do things for you would be a dream come true. But I don't feel right havin' Spike thinkin' he owes me somethin'. And you tasted that pie. Sometimes, his help isn't that helpful.
309000 [crash]
309005 Do you... have a broom I could borrow?
309000 [soap bubbles bubbling]
30900c AJ, Rarity, what's happening?
30900d Applejack saved Spike's life and now he has to serve her forever.
30900c Sweet! What are you having him do? Wash your laundry? Clean your room? Help you with your unfinished novel? Mine's about this awesome Pegasus who's the best flyer ever and becomes the captain of the Wonderbolts!
30900d [sarcastic] How ever did you come up with that ingeniously woven intricate plot line?
30900c Just came to me.
309008 Thing is, I don't really want him to serve me forever, but I don't know how to get him to stop.
30900c That's easy! Just make him help you with something really, really hard.
309008 I dunno. I don't want him to get hurt.
30900c Puh-lease. He'll quit way before there's even a chance of getting hurt!
309000 [crash]
30900c [hushed, to Applejack] Leave this to me. [to Spike] Sooo, Spike, Applejack was gonna help me stack some hay so I could practice smashing through it, but I'm feeling extra, extra powerful today.
309008 You are?
30900c Yeah, I am. So instead of hay, I'm gonna smash through rocks!
309005 Rocks?
30900c Yeah! A huge tower of rocks! And you're gonna build it!
309005 I am?
30900c Yeah, I mean, unless you don't wanna help Applejack...
309005 I do! It is Spike's dragon code!
30900c Then get to it! [to Applejack] Trust me. This is gonna work like a charm!
309005 [sounds of exertion]
30900c Huh. I was sure he'd give up after, like, three rocks.
30900e Oh, goodness. If it'd been me, I'd have just pretended I didn't have anything for him to do.
309008 Why didn't I think of that?
309005 [yelling] Is this high enough?
309008 That's plenty high! Come on down, Spike!
30900c Bad news - He actually ended up building the whole rock tower. Good news... [nervously] I've got a rock tower to knock down.
309005 Haha, yeah! You can do it! Haha, hahah, alright, yeah!
309000 [crash]
309005 That... was... awesome!
309000 [thud]
309005 Wanna do it again, Rainbow Dash? Applejack can rebuild it for you. And when I say "Applejack", I of course mean me!
30900c [dazed] Sure! Why not...?
309008 No! I mean, I don't think Rainbow Dash needs any more of your help. My help. She doesn't need it. Right, Rainbow Dash?
30900c Bbbbrrr. Yeah. I guess I'm good. For now.
309008 And so am I! I just can't think of one more thing I need help with, so you don't have to do anything else.
309000 [thud]
309005 W-What do you mean you can't think of anything else I can help with?
309008 Exactly that! There's nothin' else. I don't want you to do anything.
309005 If I don't help you, how will I know I'm a noble dragon?
309008 Well, I–
309005 Maybe there's things you need help with, but you don't even realize you need help with!
30900e If she needed help, I think she'd realize it.
309005 Maybe not! Maybe Applejack needs help realizing what she needs help with. Like... maybe your back itches!
309008 Huuuuh... that does feel... good...
309005 [laughs] See? Or you might need help remembering your favorite song! "The dragon is the finest creature ever, there's more to him than just guarding treasure..."
30900e I don't think that's her favorite s–
309005 Or... you might need help breathing!
309008 Breathin'? I certainly do not–
309000 [bellows pumping]
309000 [air being let out of balloon]
309005 See? There are plenty of things I can help you with, and you don't even have to trouble yourself with thinking of them!
309008 No, I'll think of 'em. Lemme think of 'em.
309005 As you wish.
309008 Twilight? Twilight, are you there? Twilight!
309000 [clatter]
309003 Agh!
309008 Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
309003 [sighs] No, it's okay, I need to take a break anyway. What's going on?
309008 I know Spike told you that he was gonna follow his dragon code, and serve me forever for savin' him from the timberwolves, and that you were okay with it, but–
309003 Wait, what?
309008 He said he told you all about it. I'm guessin' maybe you were a little distracted when he told you.
309003 Um, maybe a little...
309008 I should've realized you wouldn't have let him go so easily. Well, now that you know what's goin' on, maybe you could talk some sense into him!
309003 Oh, Applejack, I wish I could, but this is dragon code we're talking about. Surely you know how important the dragon code is to a dragon!
309008 I sure am startin' to.
309003 Hm, there's only one other way Spike is gonna fulfill the debt he feels he owes you.
309005 Seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five...
309008 All right, y'all, here's the deal. Spike needs to save my life.
309007 And you want us to shoot you out of a cannon towards a hornet's nest and give Spike a butterfly net so he can catch you mere seconds before you hit the nest and are stung by a thousand angry hornets! I'll wear this mustache.
309008 No. I am gonna be attacked by a timberwolf!
3091ed [gasping]
309007 Can I still wear the mustache?
309008 When I give the signal, Pinkie Pie and Rarity will come runnin' out of the woods, bein' pursued by the timberwolf. I'll start to run too, but then pretend to get my hoof stuck. I'll ask Spike to help me dislodge it, and he will, and I'll be able to get away from the terrifyin' timberwolf! Havin' saved me from certain doom, Spike will then consider us even. Everybody get it?
30912c Uh-huh.
309003 I'll do my best.
30900d Mm-hmm.
309007 Just one question.
309008 Yes? [beat] No.
309007 [sighs] Suit yourself.
309000 [crash]
30900d [clears throat] We are all ready to play our parts, ahem, but are you sure you are ready to play yours, Applejack?
309008 What d'you mean?
30900d Show us your best "damsel in distress" move.
309008 Uh... Oh, well, aheh, how's this? Hooooooo.
30900d Absolutely horrendous! Okay, this needs some serious work! Now, first, you must lift your foreleg up to your forehead, like so–
309005 [in distance] Applejack?
309008 No time! Here he comes! Uh... over here, Spike!
309005 [pants] You said you had something else you needed me to do?
309008 Oh, yes, I, I was just hopin' you could maybe, uh, sweep up all those leaves for a compost pile, and–
309005 But of course. Oh, by the way, there are exactly twenty-four million, five hundred and sixty-seven thousand, eight hundred and thirty seven blades of grass at Sweet Apple Acres.
309008 I can't believe you counted every single one of 'em...
309005 You asked me to.
30900c [inhales]
309005 And, as a noble dragon and follower of my dragon code, I–
30900c [roars like a timberwolf]
30900e That was very convincing!
30900d [screaming] Timberwolf! [sobbing] We are doomed!
309007 [screams]
30900d [to Applejack] See? Like that.
309000 [wood clacking]
309000 [wood stomping]
30900c [quietly laughing] [roars like a timberwolf]
309008 [unconvincingly] Oh no! I seem to have got my hoof caught in between two rocks! I cannot run away! I am a damsel in distress! Help me, Spike!
309005 Wait a minute.
309008 No, no, don't wait a minute. Save me from the terrifyin' timberwolf!
309005 Well, he would be terrifying if he wasn't a fake! You got the clomping on his claws...
309000 [string snapping]
309005 ...The roar was spot on, and the detail on his face is pretty good. But you forgot one thing - his breath! You could smell a real timberwolf's breath from a mile– [sniffs] [laughs] Too late, I'm already on–
309000 [magical poof]
309003 [screams]
30900c Timberwolf!
309000 [wolf snorts]
309000 [timberwolves roaring]
309005 Timberwolf!
309000 [barking]
309000 [crunching]
309008 Whooooah!
309000 [crash]
309008 Ow!
309000 [wolf howling in distance]
309000 [wood clicking]
309005 Uh oh... Applejack, come on!
309008 [grunting] I can't! I'm really stuck!
309005 No more messing around! Let's go!
309008 [grunting] Come on...
309000 [giant timberwolf roaring]
309008 Forget it, Spike! You gotta get out of here! Would you just forget your dragon code already and go?!
309005 No! I have to save you!
309000 [crunch]
309000 [giant timberwolf choking]
309005 Let's get out of here! [grunts]
309000 [giant timberwolf coughing]
309000 [crash]
309058 [panting]
309003 What happened to you guys back there? Thought you were right behind us!
309008 My hoof was stuck, and that timberwolf was coming right at me!
30900d Wait, you were actually stuck?
309005 Uh-huh!
309008 But Spike picked up a pebble, and rocketed that thing right at the huge timberwolf's mouth, and saved my life!
309005 Aw, it was nothing.
309008 It was somethin' alright! 'Course, I wouldn't've needed help if I hadn't been tryin' to stage a fake timberwolf attack in the first place.
309005 Yeah, what was that all about?
309008 [sighs] I know this code thing's important to you, but if somethin' like this comes up in the future, think maybe we can go back to my code, say "that's what friends do" and leave it at that? I promise I won't think of you as any less noble.
309005 Sounds good to me. But maybe let's just try to avoid situations where one of us actually needs the other one to save their life?
309008 You got yourself a deal.
309003 Thanks, Spike.
309005 Happy to help!
309003 Don't know what I'd do without you.
309005 No, really! I'm really really really happy to help you!
309003 [laughs] Oh...
309000 [music]
309000 [credits]
310007 I love it when Princess Celestia comes to Ponyville! I got my hooves shined just like Rarity for the occasion. Ya like?
31000d I certainly do!
310003 I'm surprised she's not here yet.
310005 [sighs] I wonder what's taking so long?
310003 And where are Applejack and Fluttershy?
31000d Fluttershy's detained helping Applejack with a mishap at Sweet Apple Acres. They'll be along.
310005 But, I still don't get why the Princess would be so late.
310003 She's bringing an important visitor. That could be part of it.
31000c A visitor who's important and slow.
31000d Maybe it's somepony so terribly important, she still had many more terribly important things to do before she got here.
310005 [gasp] Maybe the visitor has a deer antler, a goat leg, a bat wing, and a snake tail!
310003 Yeah, right. That's Discord.
31000d Why in the wide, wide world of Equestria would Princess Celestia bring along someone like that?
310005 M-m-maybe you should ask... her!
31000d Huh?
310000 [theme song]
310003 With all due respect, Princess Celestia, how could you bring Discord here?! [clears throat] Your majesty.
310019 I'm fully aware that the last time Discord was here, he created serious havoc.
31000c If by "serious havoc" you mean "turning Ponyville into the chaos capital of the world".
31000d And tricking us all into being the opposite of our true selves.
310007 And making yummy delicious chocolate milk rain all over the place without a single dollop of whipped cream to go with it anywhere in sight! Not a single dollop!
310019 Yes, I understand. But I have use for Discord's magic if it can be reformed to serve good instead of evil. This is why I've brought Discord here, because I believe that you are the ponies who can help him do just that.
310005 This will never work! This is a disaster! How will we ever control him?! We're doomed!
310019 Need I remind you that you are the ponies who turned him back into stone like this in the first place?
310003 I suppose we can just use the Elements of Harmony against him again if it gets out of hand.
310005 Uh, w-w-we probably need a volunteer to run away from here right away to get them. I'll do it!
310019 No need, Spike. I have them right here, and I've cast a spell so Discord can't take them and hide them again. Now where is Fluttershy? I believe she may know best how to begin reforming Discord.
31000c Fluttershy? Really?
310000 [beaver chittering]
310008 What's he goin' on about now?
31000e Good news. Mr Beaverton Beaverteeth has agreed to take his dam apart and move it.
310008 Well, it's about time. My apple trees are so waterlogged, I can practically hear 'em gargle!
310000 [beaver chittering]
31000e But he says first you'll have to apologize for calling him "a nuisance".
310008 Apologize? He's lucky I didn't call him a varmint!
310000 [beaver chittering]
31000e [gasps] Mr Beaverton Beaverteeth! Such language!
310008 Fine, fine. I apologize.
310000 [beaver blowing raspberry]
310008 [growls]
310000 [splash]
310008 [sighs] Thanks, Fluttershy. Don't know what I would've done without you.
31000e Glad I could help.
31000c Hey, slackers! Double time it on over to Ponyville, would ya?! We're all waiting on you!
310019 I realize that this is a tall order, but I wouldn't ask if I weren't confident you could get him to use magic obediently of his own free will.
31000e And... you really think I'll know best how to do that?
310019 I do. Now, I must return to Canterlot for Equestria's royal summit. You may release Discord when ready.
310003 Okay, ponies, guess it's time to get started. Let's just hope this releasing spell works.
310005 Or... let's not.
310003 We'd best keep our elements on at all times 'til further notice.
310025 Check!
310000 [magical warbling]
310000 [rock cracking]
3100db [screaming] [yawns] Oh! Ooh! Ooooh! Well, it's about time somepony got me out of that prison block. What a relief! [snaps fingers]
310012 [gasps]
310003 What do you think you're doing?!
3100db Nnnnnnnnngh– Why, stretching, of course. When you're a creature of chaos, stone bodysuits aren't your typical go-to fashion choice. Nnngh... [snaps fingers]
310000 [bunny roars]
310007 [gasps] Make that bunny cute again! Now!
3100db Oh... [sniggers] He's adorable the way he is.
310000 [bunny chomps]
3100db [blows raspberry] You know what else is adorable? You ponies truly believe that you can reform me, and that you're putting your faith in this one here to make it happen. Makes me wanna pinch your little horsey cheeks...
310003 How'd you know about that?!
3100db Being turned to stone doesn't keep me from hearing every word Celestia says. Although I admit it makes rolling my eyes a challenge.
310003 Well, unless you want us to turn you back to stone, you'll zap those animals back the way they were, pronto!
3100db Oh, you wouldn't dare turn me back to stone and risk disappointing your precious princess.
31000c Try us, "Dip-cord"!
31000e You think you can treat poor defenseless animals like that and get away with it?!
31000c You go, Fluttershy!
31000e You'd best watch your step, buster, or I'll give you... the Stare!
3100db [sarcastically] The Stare? Oh no, please, not that! Anything but your disapproving eyeballs! [laughs] Oh no! No no no, stop! No, no! [strangled noises] I can't! Stop! I can't take it anymore! I'll do whatever you say! Because... [laughing] You're hilarious!
310003 If it turns out we need to use our elements against you, I'm sure we can convince Princess Celestia it was for a good reason!
3100db Mmm... I suppose that's correct. [snaps fingers]
310000 [animal roars]
3100db [snaps fingers]
310000 [beavers chittering]
3100db Oopsie! Well, it looks like I know where I'll be crashing while I'm being "reformed"... With you, Fluttershy. [laughs]
31000e Oh, dear.
31000e He may be horrible, but that doesn't mean we have to act the same way. We should at least try to be hospitable. You don't mind giving up your favorite spot on the couch, do you, Angel Bunny?
310040 [angry squeaking]
31000e Oh, I'm sorry about Angel. Are you alright?
3100db Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy, for your concern. If only your pony friends could be as considerate...
31000c Don't listen to him, Fluttershy! He's just trying to drive a wedge between us like he always does.
3100db Now why in the world would I ever try to do a thing like that?
31000c So we can't unite and use the Elements of Harmony against you, that's why!
3100db I never thought of that...
31000c You big liar!
3100db Now, look who's a liar. Anyone can plainly see that I'm not big at all.
310000 [crash]
3100db Oops. [snaps fingers] There, all better. [whip]
310008 I can't watch...
31000c We'll be outside.
310003 You sure you're okay with this?
31000e I know it's not gonna be easy, but Princess Celestia's counting on me. And... I think I actually know what to do.
310003 You do?
310040 [angry squeaking]
31000e I think the key is to befriend him. Being kind to him and letting him be my house guest is probably the best way to do that.
310003 And you really think that'll work?
31000e I think it's worth a try.
310003 Okay, but if you need us, all you need to do is whisper "help", and we'll be back here with our elements. [to Discord] So watch that goat-legged step of yours, pal!
3100db Wh-what?! Look at me! I'm practically reformed already.
310000 [door shuts]
31000d She's really alright with him staying there?
310003 That's what she said.
31000c Personally, I think we should come up with a backup plan, in case this whole "befriending" business doesn't work out.
31000d Rainbow Dash is right. This is Discord we are talking about, girls. It wouldn't be a bad idea to have another trick up our sleeves.
310003 And I think I know just the trick.
31000e Discord? Oh, there you are. Listen, Discord, I just want to make sure you know that if there's anything I can do to– uh, umm, are you eating... paper?
3100db [gulp] Am I? Huh, how odd of me.
31000e Well, um... I'm just heading out, so you just make yourself at home while I'm gone.
3100db Buh-bye, have a nice time! Everything is fine here. Bye bye... Bye bye...
310000 [door shuts]
3100db You like carrots, Angel? I'm playing your owner for a fool! [laughs] How d'ya like them carrots?
310040 [screams]
3100db [snaps fingers]
310003 That's weird. The spell I had in mind isn't in here. Spike, where are the other books I asked you to pull?
310005 Right here, Twilight.
310003 I really want to have a reforming spell up and running pronto.
310005 But what if he makes the Elements of Harmony disappear like he did last time?
310003 Princess Celestia cast a spell protecting them, remember? Uh-oh.
310005 What's wrong?
310003 Princess Celestia didn't cast a spell protecting our books! Everywhere I thought I'd find the reforming spell... [gasps]
310000 [rumbling]
3100db [chomp] Are you sure this isn't overdoing it? You said to make myself at home while you were gone, but I wouldn't want to overstep my bounds.
31000e Nngh... I did say that, so... if this makes you more comfortable... by all means, please feel free.
3100db Oh. Well, it does, very much so. You're so very kind, my dear Fluttershy. I always knew that you were the understanding one, not like those nasty friends of yours.
310040 [Wilhelm scream]
31000e [gasps] My friends aren't nasty!
3100db Well, of course you'd say that. It just goes to show how understanding you truly are. You know, I think Princess Celestia is right when she singled you out as the one who could reform me. [to Angel - blows raspberry] You're off to such a good start, I'm seriously considering actually being reformed.
310003 Fluttershy! Fluttershy, can you hear me?
31000e Goodness! I hear Twilight!
310003 Fluttershy, what's going on? Are you okay?!
31000e We're fine. Everything's going great. Isn't it, Angel?
310040 [chitters dizzily]
310003 We've come to get you away from Discord! He's just terrible and, from the looks of it, completely out of control!
31000e Oh, but you're wrong! We're making great progress!
310049 Seriously?!
31000e I'm earning his trust by giving him a little space to be himself.
310005 Hate to break it to ya, but he used that "space to be himself" to tear out all the reforming spells from the library!
31000e That does explain the paper eating...
310003 He ate them?! Ugggghhhh!
31000e But we aren't gonna need a spell. He's already really considering being reformed! He said so.
310003 And you believed him?
31000e If I'm going to be his friend, I have to start by giving him the benefit of the doubt! Tell you what. Bring all the ponies over for a dinner party this evening, and I'll bet his manners will have really improved by then. I'll even get him to put the cottage back on the ground first.
310003 [sighs] Alright. Dinner it is.
31000c Ugh, I can't believe we're having a dinner party with Discord!
31000d This evening is sure to be a disaster. Glad I didn't bother wearing my fanciest outfit.
310003 Fluttershy thinks this is the way to reform Discord and asked us to give it a chance.
310000 [door opens]
3100db Oh, our pony guests! [upper class voice] We're so delighted that you've come. Please, do come in.
31000e See what a beautiful job he did helping? Discord set the entire table himself. I'm so proud.
3100db May I take your... [clears throat] hats, ladies?
310003 Hang on to your elements, girls. It's gonna be a bumpy night.
31000e As you all know, Princess Celestia hoped we'd help Discord use his magic for good instead of evil. Pinkie Pie, care for some gravy?
310007 You bet!
3100db Allow me.
310000 [gravy boat panting]
310007 Oh, what a cute little gravy boat you are! Yes you are! Yes you are!
31000c That's one creepy little gravy boat if you ask me.
31000e Oh, come on now, Dashie. You're not even giving this a chance.
31000c Hey! That's hot!
3100db Whoops! [chuckles] I'm so sorry!
31000c He did that on purpose!
3100db Oh, w-well, I don't know about that. Mistakes happen. Oh, look, everypony, dancing candles!
31000c I'm not falling for that! Discord's just trying to distract us from– [grunts] Hey! Knock it off! I suppose that's another "mistake"?
3100db No, I think you just made them mad.
310003 There's something fishy going on.
310000 [splashes]
31000e Discord?
3100db Well, it's hardly my fault if the soup tureen finds the term "something fishy" to be offensive.
31000d Not the dress! Not the dress!
310000 [splashes]
310008 That tureen's only doin' what you're makin' it do!
31000e Now let's not jump to any conclusions.
31000c Fluttershy! Can't you see what he's doing? He's playing innocent with you so you'll never agree to use the Elements of Harmony against him!
310000 [splash]
3100db Oh, well, that's a bit harsh, isn't it?
31000c You see what I'm saying, right, Fluttershy? Fluttershy!
31000e You know what I see? I see that Discord's far from perfect, but I also see none of you giving him a chance!
310015 [complaining]
31000c What's gotten into you?! Why do you keep cutting him so much slack?
31000e Because that's what friends do.
3100db We're friends?
31000e Why, of course! I can't remember my house ever being this lively before you came along.
3100db Oh... Well, I've... never really had a friend before.
31000e Well, now you do!
310040 [frantic chittering]
31000e Now is not a good time, Angel. We're having a dinner party.
310008 Hold up! I-I think he's tryin' to tell us somethin'!
310000 [splashing]
3101ee Apple!
3101ef Applejack!
31000d Oh, oh, oh! Sweet Apple Acres?
31000c Flooding at Sweet Apple Acres! And we all know who's behind that, now don't we?!
3100db Who, me?
31000c Oh, give it a rest! What do you think of your "friend" now, Fluttershy?
310008 I've never seen the floodin' this bad! They've built dams 'round here before, but never like this! What's goin' on?
310000 [beaver chittering]
31000e [gasps] Such language! [sighs] It's no use. They won't listen to a word I say!
31000c You see Discord's behind all this, right?
31000e Oh, of course I do! Do you all think I'm a silly, gullible fool?
31000d Rarity:
31000d Only in the sense
31000d of being silly and gullible...
310007 Pinkie Pie:
310007 Um, well...
310008 Applejack:
310008 Uh... uh, no, not exactly...
31000e I've just been trying to gain his friendship any way I can so he'd come to trust and listen to me.
3100db Hey there, Fluttershy! You want a turn? The water's great!
31000e Time to see if it worked.
3100db Fluttershy, oh, there you are. A sight for sore eyes.
31000e As you can see, there's a big mess down here at Sweet Apple Acres.
3100db Oh, yes. Awful business, that. Mm.
31000e It is awful. This is Applejack's home, and it's being destroyed by innocent creatures who would never be acting this way if it weren't for your reckless behavior. You need to fix this.
3100db Oh, yes, very well, I will fix it. I only ask one thing in return.
31000e Yes?
3100db I ask that you never use your Element of Harmony against me. As a sign of our friendship.
31000e I will never use my Element of Harmony against you.
3100db Excellent! [snaps fingers] There, much better! I do prefer ice skating to water skiing! Don't you? [humming]
310000 [crowd cheering]
31000e Discord! That's not fixing it! Why, I oughta...
3100db Where are you going? What's wrong, pal?
31000e Don't call me your pal!
3100db Oh, pfft, come skating with me, and we'll let bygones be bygones.
310005 Here you go, Fluttershy! Game on!
310003 He fixes this or he goes back to being stone! Princess Celestia will understand!
31000e I made a promise not to use my element against him, and I'm going to keep it.
310007 [gasps]
31001d [groans]
3100db Hahah! You see? She wants to have fun with me because we're friends. She can't use the elements against me because we're friends. I'm free forever! [laughs]
31000e [growls] Not! Your! Friend!
3100db Who cares? I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. I'm Discord, the master of chaos! You think you can boss Discord around? You think I'm just going to turn all this back because you say so? Because if I don't, I'll lose the one friend I ever had? ...Huh. Oh. Well played, Fluttershy. Well played.
310000 [magic noises]
310015 [cheering]
3100db I like it better my way, but... I guess when you're friends, you can't always have things exactly your way all the time, eh?
3100db Yes, Princess, I'm ready to use my magic for good instead of evil. [under his breath] Most of the time.
310019 Congratulations on your success, ponies. I definitely sense a big change in Discord. I'll leave the Elements of Harmony with you, Twilight. Just in case.
310003 You were right when you said Fluttershy would be the one to find the way to reform Discord. By treating Discord as a friend, she got him to realize that friendship was actually important to him. And something that, once he had, he didn't want to lose.
31000e Go on. Say it...
3100db [groans] Alright. [quickly] Friendship is magic.
31000e See? He can be a real sweetheart once you get to know him.

311005 [humming] [singing] Spike is great... making a jewel cake... [chewing]
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 Me, that's who. [singing] Been saving up my gems so fine... for a cake that is divine... [chewing]
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 Who are you hooing at?
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 I know, they're delicious.
311000 [jewels rattling]
311005 Now you see 'em, now you don't. [chewing] [belches] Mm! [singing] This is how you make a jewel cake - stir in some gems, and then you bake. [chewing] Mm-hmm! Gonna, eat, eat it up! Gonna– [gasps] What happened to all my jewels?! [drums claws] I had a bowl full of them here, and now I don't! Which means somebody took 'em!
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 Who? That's what I'm asking, who?! Who took my jewels?! Oh. I'm who. This cake was gonna be so good! Why? [thump] Why?! [gulps] Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!
3110c3 [hoots]
311000 [theme song]
311005 [singing] I have no jewels... I have no cake... I'm a sad little dragon... With nothing to–
311000 [knock on door]
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 ...is it?
311000 [door opens]
31100e Oh! Oh goodness, I-I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
311005 Well... I do have this cake to not bake...
31100e Oh... sorry, it's a bad time.
311005 Uh, inside joke. Talk to me.
31100e It's just that... Princess Cadance needs us to do a great job welcoming the Head of the Equestria Games when she visits the Crystal Empire tomorrow–
311005 Oh, I know all about that. As if I wouldn't be any help at welcoming...
31100e Oh, I don't know what was I thinking. Of course you might be upset for not being invited, and... here I am coming to ask you for a favor. You were probably going to say no anyway. All I had to offer you in exchange was one little jewel.
311005 What was that?
31100e [yelps] All I have is this jewel.
311005 [slurp] That's a really big one. A really big, juicy, perfect-for-a-cake-topper jewel.
31100e Does this mean you'll do it?
311005 Yeah... Sure...
31100e Oh, thank you, thank you! So while I'm gone, you'll take care of Angel, and tomorrow is Tuesday, which is his tail-fluffing day, and it's really important for him to look good.
311005 Wait, what? You want me to take care of him?
311040 [blows raspberry]
31100e Oh, well, yes. But if it's too much trouble, I can always see if there is somepony else.
311005 Uhh... We already agreed on the whole jewel thing, so I'll just...
31100e Thank you, thank you, thank you! Angel, aren't you just so excited?
311040 [distressed squeaking]
31100e See you tomorrow.
311040 [blows raspberry]
311005 You know... She's not the only pony with a pet that might need some watching...
311000 [gyrocopter spinning]
311005 All I'm saying is, if Fluttershy thought that her beloved little friend shouldn't be left alone while you're busy in the Crystal Empire, then maybe that's just something to think about.
311000 [gems clinking]
31100c Tch! Tank's not some fuzzy little bunny. He can take care of himself.
311000 [thwack]
311000 [thudding]
31100c He's a strong, fearless, and totally together pet.
311000 [crash]
311000 [apples rolling]
31100c [groans]
311000 [gyrocopter restarts]
311000 [crunch]
311005 [whistles innocently]
31100c Alright. You can watch him, but only because... uh... Tank's got a strict flying regimen, and-and someone needs to make sure that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone.
3111f0 [licking]
31100d Ohh! [laughs]
31100c You know... the two of us are very diligent.
311005 Okay, whatever.
31100d Yes, yes, more importantly, as for Opal, she likes to eat every thirty six and a half minutes, you groom her with her silken brush, head to toe...
311000 [scribbling]
31100d ...Oh, and don't forget to pooch her pillow out in the middle, that's where she likes it. And the temperature in the room should always be exactly eighty one point four degrees. That's the only way she can get to sleep.
31106a [purring]
311000 [scribbling]
311000 [feather spontaneously combusting]
31100d And, um... hmm... oh, good, so thanks for your help and good luck to you.
31100c A-hem... I think the dragon was expecting a little something for his efforts.
311000 [gem sparkling]
311005 Almost as beautiful as the pony who gave it to me...
31100c Shouldn't you be critter-proofing the library or something? Tank has a tendency to–
311000 [thud]
31106a [yowls]
311000 [crash]
311005 Critter-proofing. Yeah, I'll get right on that. [chuckles] Three down, three to go.
311005 What's that you said, Gummy? Uh-huh. Well, you're just gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie about that one.
311000 [sproing]
311007 Ask me, ask me!
311005 Go ahead, ask her!
311000 [boing]
311007 Of course you can have another cupcake! Mm? Mm-hm? Yeah? Why didn't you say so? I'll get you a bigger pond immediately.
311005 I think what Gummy's trying to say is–
311007 He's always wanted a pair of riding pants? His toenails need a new coat of shellac? He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once? [giggles]
311005 I think what Gummy's trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.
311007 Who wouldn't?! Spike time is the best!
311005 Alas, it doesn't come cheap.
31100c All I'm saying is you might wanna think about a helmet. You only want to get hit in the head by a flying turtle... once.
311005 A thousand plus carats of pure deliciousness... [slurp]
311008 Looks like you got a regular pet day care in here, Spike. You'll still be able to get some good play time with Winona like you said though, won't ya? She tends to get a little wild if she doesn't get her exercise.
311005 Exercise. Sure, of course.
311028 [barks]
311005 Whoa!
311003 I don't remember seeing critters on the invite list.
311008 That's 'cause we're leavin' them here with Spike. He's gonna do a little critter-sittin' for us.
311003 Oh, really?
311000 [thunk]
31100e So sorry I'm late. Silly bunny had hidden his brush. Be sure you get plenty on his tail, or it won't get as poofy as he likes it.
311008 Come on, girls, or we're gonna miss the train. One more for the road? Oh, you little puppy-wuppy, come on here! [chuckles]
311007 No, no no no. I love you more. No, I love you more! I LOVE YOU MORE!
31100e Oh, I promise it'll be okay. I'll fluff your tail twice next week. Three times?
31100d Oh, I know. It's a chilly eighty one point two in here. Spike, take care of this, would you please?
311005 You got it! So, uhh... What are you thinking about that hooting little friend of yours? Suppose you want me to keep an eye on him too.
311003 That would be nice. You sure you don't already have your hands full?
311005 Nah, pshaw. I'll be fine. But, uh, just between you and me, I gotta give priority to the... paying customers.
311003 [sigh] You absolutely sure you can do this?
311005 Of course. Wouldn't have agreed to it if I couldn't. Piece of cake. Speaking of cake, I got a little something I need to attend to.
311003 Yeah, like keeping an eye on a house full of critters.
311005 [slurp] Uh, yeah, uh, that was totally what I was talking about. Relax. Go to your welcoming thing in the Crystal Empire. Spike's got it all under control.
311000 [door closes]

311005 There are six of you, but there's only one right here in front of me... Gah! Two! And what I say goes!
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 Spike, the boss of you, that's who. One, two, three! Nngh, come on, number four!
31106a [yowls] [scratches]
311005 Whoa! Guh...
3110c6 [sucking]
311000 [squelch]
311005 One, two, three, four, five... Argh, who's missing?
311000 [zip]
311005 Angel.
311000 [thunk]
311000 [gyrocopter spinning]
311005 All I wanted were some jewels. Big, juicy, delicious jewels. Now what do I have? A missing rabbit and–
311028 [barks] [sniffs]
311066 Awww, little fluffy Angel Bunny-kins! You're so cute! The natural weaves in his fluff are to die for!
311005 [clears throat]
311040 [thumping]
311066 Isn't Angel just the cutest thing you've ever seen?!
311040 [blows raspberry]
311000 [ding]
311005 [to Angel] Look, you don't wanna be with me. I'd rather not chase you around all over the place when I could be enjoying some jewel cake. Watch me solve both of our problems. [to the Cutie Mark Crusaders] Y'know, I'm supposed to be watching him, but you all have just hit it off so well that maybe, maybe I could let you take care of him instead.
31100a We would, but we've got some major Crusaders business planned for today!
311065 Major. We're getting our skydiving cutie marks today!
311080 Ha! Yeah!
311005 Well, I suppose, if you've got other plans... It's just, you're so good with them. Like get-a-cutie-mark-for-bunny-sitting good?
31100a A bunny-sittin' cutie mark...
311066 That would be adorable!
311065 He does seem to like us.
31100a And we haven't exactly figured out how we're gonna pull off this whole skydivin' thing.
311005 You know what? As hard as it's gonna be for me to part with these little guys, I think you should probably just take all of them. If you ask me, nngh, the more critters you take care of, the more chances you have of getting some kind of critter-sitting cutie mark. Am I right or am I right?
31100a Sure!
311000 [door shuts]
311005 Yes!
31100a But wait! How're we gonna take good care of them without treats for when they're good?
311066 And we'll need beds for when they're tired!
311065 And toys! They need toys!
311005 It's an afternoon. They don't need all that stuff. They'll be fine.
31100a We need to be able to buy them some things! One jewel might be able to cover it all.
311005 Uh... what would I possibly be doing with jewels?
31100a I happen to know for a fact that Applejack gave you a gem to watch Winona, which means...
311005 Obviously, no one around here is getting a cutie mark for kindness toward a poor, hungry little dragon. Take it or leave it.
31100a We'll take it.
311000 [zip]
311000 [door shuts]
311005 [singing] Gonna put in some flour, and add a little sugar for my five de-li-cious jewels!
311066 [distant] But pink feathers would look so good with your eyes!
311005 Meh... that bird could use a little color.
311065 [distant] Has anyone seen Tank's head? Where's his head?!
311000 [door opens]
311005 What have you done to the turtle?!
311000 [pop]
311065 Ohh, I totally forgot he could do that. Heh.
31100a Yeah, so, pretty sure critter-sittin' cutie marks are out.
311066 And our critter-grooming cutie marks probably aren't going to appear anytime soon either.
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 [groans] Alright, load 'em up. And you can gimme back that jewel I gave you.
31100a Sorry, we don't have it anymore.
311005 What? Why not?!
311065 How do you think we paid for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?
311000 [dryer blowing]
311005 [groans] Oh.
311028 [barks]
31106a [yowls]
311000 [crash]
311040 [laughs]
311047 Zecora knows just what to do about all this bad mojo that's floating around you.
311005 I'm thinking a cage and a great big lock might be next.
311047 Zecora can take the bad away if you do just what I say.
311005 Really?
311047 But before I can do my duty, I am going to need some of your booty.
311005 [sighs] Where are you going?
311047 You think jewels are what you need, but there's no worse mojo than dragon greed.
311040 [laughs]
311005 [stomach growling]
311000 [pets fighting]
311005 Almost there...
311009 [suspiciously] Mm-hm...
311005 Just taking good care of everyone's animals. What am I gonna have to do to get this to go away? [sighs] And this is just between you and me, right? No other pony has to hear a word about it?
311000 [pets fighting]
311009 A word about what now?
311005 This better be important.
311000 [steam hissing]
31113e All aboard!
311005 Angel.
31113e I can't have all of these animals on my train. Not without tickets and not without chaperones.
311005 All I need is to get on for one minute, grab a bunny, and get off! Promise!
31113e [laughs] Likely story. No chaperone, no train.
311080 [laughing]
311065 Skydiving cutie marks!
311000 [splash]
311005 Is three ponies enough? [sighs] At least I have you two left, my delectable little treasures.
31113e All aboard for the Crystal Empire!
311080 Crystal Empire?!
311065 I've always wanted to see the Crystal Empire!
311066 I wish I were dressed for it, but still... [squealing] THE CRYSTAL EMPIRE!
311005 We're not really going! We just needed to get on the train so I can get that rabbit! And when I do, we're off!
311065 What?!
31100a That's not fair!
311040 [blows raspberry]
311005 There he is!
31113e Next stop, the Crystal Empire!
311005 No, no, no, no, no, no!
311000 [train engine chugging]
31100a So it seems like the Crystal Empire would be really cold, but I've heard that it's not! It's as warm as can be!
311065 Do you think the walls are crystal? [gasps] Maybe even see-through! Can you imagine see-through walls?
311000 [door opens]
311080 [gasping]
311000 [crash, crunch]
3111f1 [yowls]
311005 Take it! Just take it!
311000 [train engine chugging]
311065 So beautiful!
311005 Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause we're not getting out of this car until we're back in Ponyville!
31100a There is no way, no how, we're comin' all the way to the Crystal Empire without lookin' around!
311005 Nopony's gonna get past this dragon!
31100a Don't make me use this!
311005 You wouldn't dare! [giggles]
311000 [crunch]
311005 Oh no! [gasps]
311065 Whoa, just whoa.
311080 [giggling]
311066 Ah! I'm in crystal heaven!
311005 Shhh! They're right there! There's the bunny! Please, please, pretty please, don't go down there! I'll fluff your tail! I'll perm, highlight, and blow it out if you'll just stop!
311040 [blows raspberry]
311005 What do you want?! Name it, and it's yours! [pants] [groans] [kisses] Hyah!
311080 [gasping]
311040 [crying]
311000 [click]
311000 [luggage clattering]
31100e Oh my goodness.
31113e All aboard!
311005 Hah! You're coming with me!
311040 [crying]
311005 We made it!
311066 Without seeing the palace!
311003 I think this car's empty.
311005 They're coming this way! Everybody down!
311066 There has to be a better solution!
311005 Shh! Oh, don't sit down, don't sit down!
311008 Whooeee! My dogs are barkin'.
311028 [barks]
311008 Did y'all hear that? They really are!
31100c Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here.
311003 I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.
311008 Think he's still got a handle on things?
311003 If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader.
311005 Go ahead, bunny. Do your worst. I deserve it. I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else, I didn't take these silly things out, or fluff this like I was supposed to. I wasn't really thinking about you at all. Any of you. Just wanted the jewels. I hope you'll all forgive me someday.
311028 [licks]
311005 You will? [stomach growls] Oh great. I'm gonna be the one who gives us away.
311000 [clink]
311005 Where did you– [stomach growls]
311008 You all hear that?
311000 [patting]
311000 [train braking]
311008 I can't wait to scratch the belly on Winona. Oh, I miss her.
311003 I can't wait to see Owlowiscious! [giggles]
311005 Hello! Thought we'd meet you at the station!
311066 So we could hear all about the Crystal Empire, and find out if you brought us one of the crystal snow globes that they sell at the train station!
31100d How did you know about the snow globes?
311066 Um... lucky guess?
311003 I've gotta hand it to you, Spike. You did a really good job of taking care of the animals.
311000 [gyrocopter spinning]
31100e Oh, Spike, Angel looks perfect! You did such a good job fluffing his tail.
311005 Yeah, well... we're like this now.
3110c3 [hoots]
311005 You know who.
3110c3 [hoots]
311003 So what are you thinking? Bake 'em into a jewel pie? Ooh, six-layer gem cake sounds pretty good!
311005 Yeah, it does. [slurps] It really, really does. Whyyyyyyyyy???!!!

312000 [noises of ruckus]
31200c Hurry up, Twilight! We can't miss our train!
31213e Tickets.
312008 Oh, this is gonna be a real treat. Princess Cadance said she'd never seen the Crystal Ponies so excited.
31200c Duh! Of course they're excited. They're up for the Equestria Games. It's only the biggest sporting event in all of Equestria.
31200d Didn't Cloudsdale host the Equestria Games one year?
31200c No. Cloudsdale should have hosted the games one year. I'll never forget when we got the bad news.
3121f2 The Equestria Games go to... the city of Fillydelphia.
3120b7 NOOOOOOOOOOO!
31200c These Crystal Ponies lost a thousand years to an evil king's curse. They've had enough bad news. No way we're letting them experience the pain of losing out on these games.
312003 Exactly. Princess Cadance is counting on us to do our part to convince the Games inspector to choose the Crystal Empire. And we are not gonna let her down, are we?
312007 NOOOOOOOOOOO! What? I was just answering Twilight's question.
312000 [theme song]
312000 [train whistle]
312012 Four, three, two, one! The Crystal Empire, that's the one!
312007 [through megaphone] Okay, everypony, great job! Sounds like we're ready.
31201f [cheers, etc.]
312003 One more time from the top.
312025 [groans]
31200d Oh, please! I think that was perfect.
312008 [sighs] But we've run this, like, twelve times already. I think we've got it.
312003 Cadance said the Games inspector really puts folks through the wringer on her visits. There's no margin for error here. And this time we need to practice the steps.
312008 On a train car?
31200c You heard the pony! On your hooves!
312012 Two, four, six, eight– [screams]
312000 [brakes squealing]
312000 [crash]
3121f3 Crystal Empire, ladies! Watch your step leaving the train!
31200d [groans]
312008 [sighs] Probably should've watched our step while we were still on it, too.
312000 [train chugging]
312007 Wow! The Crystal Empire looks crystallier than ever!
312008 They must have everypony in the Empire out sprucing it up!
312003 This must be why we were asked to handle the welcome committee routine.
31200c And it's probably also because we'll be awesome at it.
312008 Princess Cadance was right. These ponies do look pretty darn excited.
31200c Yup, I remember that feeling. But not as much as I remember the crushing wave of disappointment that came when things didn't work out. That right there. That is the face I do not want to see.
31211a [mutters of agreement]
312000 [door opens]
312003 We're here.
312198 [giggles] There are my girls.
3121f4 Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake!
31200d [gasp]
3121f4 Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [giggling]
31200d Oh, my. This is spectacular. Please, everypony, stand back! I need air!
312198 Go ahead and try whatever you like. It's all complimentary for the welcome committee.
31200d Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
312198 That over there is a crystal mud bath, which relaxes your body and rejuvenates your coat. Now, I realize it can be kind of strange to climb into mud, but if you'll just give it a chance, I'm sure–
312007 Woo-hoo!
312003 Pinkie, no!
312007 [laughing] Ahh, so relaxing!
312003 Pinkie Pie! Honestly!
312198 [breathes in]
312003 [breathes in]
312198 [breathes out]
312003 [breathes out]
312198 Go ahead, have a good time while I get my ceremonial headdress done.
31200d Ceremonial... headdress?
312198 When meeting with important guests, it was tradition for rulers of the Crystal Empire to weave crystals into their manes in a very specific way. The Games inspector is known for doing her homework. She'll certainly be expecting my look to reflect the importance of her visit.
312000 [door opens]
3121f5 Princess, if I may have a word... I-I have two pieces of news for you. First, your mane stylist has the flu and won't be able to make it for fear of you catching it, too.
312198 Oh. Well... I hope she's better soon. Do any of the other stylists here know how to do the traditional royal ceremonial headdress?
3121b0 Um... well... uh... (No.)
312198 Oh. [breaths in] [breaths out] Just a... small detail.
31200c Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're trying to land the Equestria Games here. There is no such thing as a small detail!
312003 Rainbow Dash!
31200d I suppose... I could give it a shot.
312198 Oh, Rarity, you would do that for me?
31200c Way to step it up, Rare!
312198 Fortunately, I have all the precise instructions right here.
312000 [paper unfurling]
31200d Oh, my!
312198 You sure you're up to this?
31200d Working on the hair of royalty on such an auspicious occasion is the opportunity of a lifetime! I will give it everything I've got!
312003 See? No worries!
31200d Besides, the Games inspector isn't expected for several hours. I'll have plenty of time to figure out exactly how to... do... this...
312198 Oh, Rarity, that's wonderful! [to Golden Hooves] You said you had a second bit of news?
3121f5 Yes, quite. The Games inspector, Ms. Harshwhinny, will be arriving on the... next train.
31204d [gasp]
31200c What!? You couldn't have told her that news first!? That's fifteen minutes from now!
31200e Oh, my goodness!
31200c [panicked breathing]
312003 [breathes in] [breathes out] How long before Cadance is ready?
31200d Hmmmm... I'm sure to find some shortcuts.
312003 Can you have her back at the castle when we're done?
31200d Done.
312003 Okay, we'll be fine. Everypony, just be on the look out for the pony with the flower print luggage.
312007 Easy peasy, pudding in the freezy!
312003 We bring the Games inspector back to the castle, put on our big welcome committee how-do-you-do and then...
312007 Put the pudding out to thaw before you eat it or you'll crack a tooth?
31200c I'll just ignore that. We need to remember that the Games inspector arriving early is probably part of a plan to psych us out.
312003 What do you mean?
31200c You said it yourself. She's got a rep for trying to catch hosts off-guard, just to see if we can handle the kind of massive pressure that comes with hosting the Equestria Games.
31200e Oh, no... We're gonna blow it...
31200c Not if we always stay one step ahead and don't fall for any of her mind games. Anything she throws at us, we just need to remember she's testing us and roll with it.
312000 [train braking]
31200c Excuse me, ma'am?
3121f6 Yes, what is it?
31200e Oh, no!
312003 Be cool. [to Ms. Peachbottom] Well, I know you're not expecting us, but we're here to personally welcome you to the Crystal Empire.
3121f6 The whole lot of you came to do that?
312003 Uh, well, um... yes!
3121f6 Well, darn tootin', ain't that the cat's meow! Y'all didn't need to do that. Why, I hardly expected anything like this.
312008 Whew! The Princess wouldn't have had it any other way.
3121f6 The Princess? Princess Cadance?
312003 None other!
3121f6 Well, tie me up and throw me down! This just keeps gettin' better and better!
31200e Can we help you with your bags?
3121f6 Don't mind if ya do!
31200e Ooh, I love flower print! Sorry.
312007 Our first stop is the castle, where we got a big razzamatazzy welcome planned for you!
3121f6 The castle? Are you kidding?! Hot-diggety-dawg!
312003 See that? We just gotta roll with it until the Princess gets there and we'll be just fine.
312000 [train chugging]
312000 [drilling noise]
312000 [stretching noise]
312198 So, uh... how's it going so far?
31200d Oh, I'm so sorry... It's just... oh so complicated. [laughs nervously] I can fix it!
312198 Fix what?!
31200d Well, I-I was looking for shortcuts and I thought step twelve was optional! But it's not!
3121f6 My golly, the crystal castle! [gasps] Why, I've seen pictures, but I never expected to see it with my very own eyes! [gulps] From the inside...
31200e Oh, my gosh, she's so nice!
31200c You're letting her lull you into a false sense of confidence. Watch that. It's all part of the game.
312000 [twang]
3121f6 Oh, my, I'm so excited.
312003 Please, have a seat, won't you?
3121f6 Mind if I take a quick run outside first? It was an awfully long train ride and my legs could use a stretch.
312003 Oh, well... we were just about to start.
3121f6 Oh! Never you mind. You go on ahead. I'm listening.
31200c She was probably testing us to see if we could remain in control of a complex situation. Looks like we passed. Bump–
31200e –cha!
312003 We'd like to thank you for this opportunity to introduce you to this wonderful kingdom!
3121f6 Oh, why, the pleasure is all mine.
312003 And since we're not even from here ourselves, who better than us to let you know just how welcoming this place can be!
312012 Mane Six:
312012 Two, four, six, eight!
312012 Name a place that's really great!
312012 One, two, three, four!
312012 Keeps you coming back for more!
312012 Two, seven, nine, three!
312012 The place that we all wanna be!
312012 Four, three, two, one!
312012 The Crystal Empire, that's the one!
3121f6 Oooh, yeah! [whistles]
312012 [panting]
3121f6 Ooh, I tell ya! I have traveled far and wide, but I have never, ever been welcomed anyplace in the fashion that y'all have done here today.
312003 That's fantastic! Princess Cadance would be so glad to hear that!
3121f6 Honestly, I'm surprised she knows anything about me at all!
312000 [pause]
312003 Of course she does! She's been looking forward to your visit for weeks!
3121f6 Oh, goody! Is she here?
312003 Uh...
312008 [hushed] Where the heck is she anyway? Wasn't she supposed to be here by now?
3121f6 Oh, that's all right. [gulps] Maybe I-I-I'll just take my little run outside now. [panting]
31200c Or, if you like, we could give you a tour of the castle! That way you could be learning and stretching all at the same time!
3121f6 Ooh, a tour of the crystal castle... I'd love that a whole heap.
312003 [hushed] Dash! We've hardly ever even been here before!
31200c [hushed] It's just another test! We gotta roll with it, remember?
312007 Oooh! Lemme give the tour! I'lldoit, I'lldoit, letmeletmeletme!
312003 [breathes in] [breathes out] Fine. You all start giving her the tour, and I'll go see what's keeping Cadance.
312000 [luggage dragging]
3121f7 Oof!
312003 Hello there!
3121f7 Hello yourself. First hello of the day–
312000 [splash]
3121f7 Oof! [groans]
312003 [humming]
31200d [gasps] W-What are you doing here?
312003 We finished the welcome committee song and we just wanted to introduce Ms. Harshwhinny to–
31200d No, no! Princess Cadance isn't ready. Something's gone terribly wrong!
312003 I need to speak to the Princess.
31200d You can't! You mustn't! She's in the middle of a delicate conditioning rinse that must go perfectly if there's to be any hope for her hair!
312003 Come on, how bad can it be?
31200d Imagine her mane turned into a porcupine.
312003 Ew.
31200d Please! I will bring her back from the brink of tragedy, but you have got to buy me some time! There's no other way!
312000 [door slams]
312007 So, you see this here? This, um, this is, um... a big, round room. It's known for its roundness and bigness. And did I mention that it's round?
3121f6 I think they call it a rotunda? A small, confining, rotunda...
312007 [blows raspberry] Whatever. Round is round, am I right?
312008 [hushed] Easy, Pinkie, let's play this safe! We got her in a good mood, so let's not do anything to ruin that.
3121f6 You know... I love this sort of architecture. I-I-I detect a neo-Gothic inspiration in the design, yes?
312007 Hey! Look at me! [makes funny noises]
312008 [sighs] And not a moment too soon. Where's Cadance? Please tell me she's right behind you.
312003 There's a bit of a problem with her headdress. How's it going here?
312007 Boingy, boingy, boingy! [wibbles tongue]
3121f6 I, uh, hate to be a bother, but the legs are cramping up on me with all this standing around...
31200c Huh?
312003 She's getting bored, and we have to buy Rarity some more time. [breathes in] [breathes out] I'll see if Shining Armor can come help. Can't one of you other ponies take over in the meantime?
31200c I got this. Wanna stretch your legs, huh? Well, whatever you need, I'm sure we can provide. Let's just make our way to the castle's gymnasium. Our tour will now be headed... this way. And we're walking, and we're walking...
312003 [humming]
312000 [door opens]
3121f8 [indistinct conversations]
312193 Twily!
312003 Hello there! Shining Armor, you've gotta help me.
312193 [blows whistle] Everything okay?
312003 I left the other ponies behind giving the Games inspector the worst castle tour ever.
312193 Come on, gang! Are we gonna gallop, or are we gonna trot!? [to Twilight] Castle tour, huh? I'm pretty sure I can give you a hoof with that. [to athletes] Let's move, move, move! [to Twilight] Everything's gonna be okay.
312003 I know, I'm not worried. I'm not worried... it worked!
3121f6 [gasping] I'm outside! [laughing] Feels so good to stretch the old legs!
312193 Uh, what the–
31200c Turns out the crystal castle doesn't have a gymnasium.
312193 Watch it!
312000 [crash]
3121f6 Woo-hoo!
312193 Make her stop!
31200c Wait, that's the Games inspector! Let her do her thing.
3121f6 Good. Oh, these hooves! I'm outside!
312193 Why would she do that?
31200c I have no idea, but that's why she's who's in charge of choosing who gets the Games, and we're not.
312000 [crashing]
312000 [skidding]
3121f6 [muffled] Oh! Oh, get me outside for a run!
312193 Look out!
312000 [crash]
31200c Yeah, okay, we need to stop her.
3121f6 [muffled, hysterical yelps]
312000 [splash]
31200e Where's she going in such a hurry?
3121f6 [muffled, hysterical yelps]
31200c Closer... closer... I think we've got her... Yaaaaaaah!
312000 [thud]
312000 [glass squeaking]
3121f6 Hoo-eee! Oh, that felt good! Nothing like a great run to shake the cobwebs off these old bones.
31200c [panting]
3121f6 Hey there, speedy. Ah, these wide open spaces y'all got here remind me of home. This is great!
31200c Oh! [pants] So you're [pants] enjoying your visit? [pants] Well, I'm so [pants] glad! [pants]
3121f6 Oh, good golly, yes. I just love to travel and see new places. Such a beautiful spot you got here, too!
312193 Why... thank you so much! I'm Shining Armor.
3121f6 [gasps] The Prince!
312003 What's going on?
31200c From the looks of it, just locking up the games for the Crystal Empire is all. Ain't no thing.
3121f6 My, oh, my... I never met a Prince before...
312193 [chuckles] I'm surprised. I'd think in your line of work you'd meet princes all the time.
3121f6 Hardly. Just an ordinary wild mustang from Mustangia here to enjoy a little vay-cay. Never thought I'd also be meeting royalty to boot. [giggles]
312003 You... are Ms. Harshwhinny, the Equestria Games inspector... aren't you?
3121f6 Inspector what-now?
31200c We got the wrong pony?!
312007 NOOOOOOOOOOO! I mean, YEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!
312003 [panicked breathing]
312008 Oh, please still be here... Oh please, oh please, oh please...
312003 There's got to be another pony with flower print luggage around here somewhere.
31200c Except that there isn't!
312003 We've gotta find her before Cadance finds out what a mess we've made of things.
31200c Okay, here's what we do. We split the Empire up into five sectors.
31200e Each of us search a sector.
312007 Well... except for the spa. What's the point of checking there? That's where Cadance is. If Ms. Harshwhinny is there, well, then, game over, right?
3120d4 [gasp]
3121f7 Every city and empire wants to host the Equestria Games. So, I have to go through all the big phony-baloney song and dance, though of course, I'm never getting the real inside scoop.
3121f6 Oh, golly, I've been having a swell time since I got here. I'm actually thinking of extendin' my stay.
3121f7 And what exactly has made your visit so special?
3121f6 Oohohohoooh, gosh, where to start?
31200c Oh, there she is! We're in luck! I don't think either of them knows yet that the other one's here!
312000 [bell rings]
31200d Wonderful news, look! Princess Cadance, better than new!
3121f7 Princess Cadance? So, this is where you've been! I will have you know this is by far the worst welcome I've had in all my years!
312198 I-I can't believe it... What was wrong with your welcome?
3121f7 There wasn't one!
312198 What is going on?
31200c Princess, we gave our welcome to the wrong pony, left the right one waiting at the station, and completely ruined everything.
312007 [nervously] Cinnamon bun? [squee]
31200c When I was a little filly, I wanted so badly for Cloudsdale to win the Equestria Games. But it didn't happen. So I thought I could make up for that disappointment by helping the Crystal Empire win the chance to host the Games. But it looks like I ruined your chances instead.
3121f6 Not so fast, speedy.
3121f7 I just finished hearing about how this pony was just treated to the warmest, finest, most fabulous reception she ever had.
3121f6 Darn tootin'!
3121f7 Courtesy of these fine ponies right here. Which, in my expert opinion, amounts to the first ever unvarnished, unrehearsed, and unbiased appraisal of a potential host of the Equestria Games. Which can only mean one thing...
312198 [through microphone] The next host of the Equestria Games is... the Crystal Empire!
312000 [cheering]
31200c We did it!
312198 [through microphone] Congratulations, Crystal Ponies!
312000 [boom]
31200c [sighs] You know, it feels good to help others get something you always wanted but never had. Almost as good as getting it yourself. Almost.
312003 We'll still be able to come back here and watch the games when they're played.
31200c You're right. That'll rock!
312000 [luggage collapsing]
31200e Oh, my goodness.
31213e All aboard!
31200c Huh, bummer Spike had to miss out on all this. He woulda' had fun here.
312003 I'm sure he's having a great time watching all the critters back at home.
312008 Think he's still got a handle on things?
312003 [breathes out] If he's staying calm and collected, I bet he's doing a terrific job as a leader.
312000 [stomach growl]
312008 You all hear that?

313003 Rainbow Dash, that's not funny!
31300d Terribly sorry, darling. I'm afraid I'm... I'm not good with the thundery ones.
313003 [gasp] Something tells me everything is not going to be fine.
313000 [theme song]
313003 What are you doing? What happened to your cutie mark?
31300d Whatever do you mean, Twilight? I'm simply doing what I've done since the day it first appeared. Does my sky look fabulous or what?
313000 [ponies complaining]
31300d Too last season?
313003 Where is Rainbow Dash? Why isn't she handling this?
313005 [yawns] I still don't know what you had to wake me up for. I love sleeping in the rain.
313003 It's not about the weather, Spike. Rarity had Rainbow Dash's cutie mark and said this was Rainbow Dash's cottage. Something strange is going on... [knocks]
313000 [animal noises]
31300c Hey, guys.
313003 Rainbow Dash! Why is Rarity doing your job?
313000 [crash]
313003 And what in Equestria is going on in... here?
31300c [Rainbow Dash]
31300c These animals don't listen, no, not one little bit
31300c They run around out of control and throw their hissy fits
31300c It's up to me to stop them, 'cause plainly you can see
31300c It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me
31300e [Fluttershy]
31300e I try to keep them laughing, put a smile upon their face
31300e But no matter what I try, it seems a bit of a disgrace
31300e I have to entertain them, it's there for all to see
31300e It's got to be my destiny, and it's what my cutie mark is telling me
313007 [Pinkie Pie]
313007 I don't care much for pickin' fruit and plowin' fields ain't such a hoot
313007 No matter what I try, I cannot fix this busted water chute!
313007 I've got so many chores to do, it's no fun being me
313007 But it has to be my destiny, 'cause it's what my cutie mark is telling me
313008 [Applejack]
313008 Lookie here at what I made, I think that it's a dress
313008 I know it doesn't look like much, I'm under some distress
313008 Could y'all give me a hand here and help me fix this mess?
313008 My destiny is not pretty, but it's what my cutie mark is tellin' me
31300d [Rarity]
31300d I'm in love with weather patterns, but the others have concerns
31300d For I just gave them frostbite over top of their sunburns
31300d I have to keep on trying, for everyone can see
313000 [Rarity and Rainbow Dash]
313000 It's got to be
31300e [Fluttershy]
31300e It's got to be
313007 [Pinkie Pie]
313007 My destiny
313008 [Applejack]
313008 My destiny
313000 [Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Fluttershy]
313000 And it's what my cutie mark
313000 [Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy]
313000 It's what my cutie mark
313000 [Rarity, Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Applejack]
313000 Yes, it's what my cutie mark is telling me!
313003 This is bad. This is very, very bad.
313005 What's going on? Why is this happening?!
313003 Last night when you were taking one of your seven-hour bubble baths, I got a special delivery from the princess.
313003 Dear Twilight Sparkle,
313003 The spell contained on the last page of this book is Star Swirl the Bearded's secret unfinished masterpiece. [gasps] Ooh! He was never able to get it right and thus abandoned it. I believe you are the only pony who can understand and rewrite it. Princess Celestia
313003 From one to another, another to one. A mark of one's destiny singled out alone, fulfilled. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't even rhyme!
313003 I cast the spell so I could find out what it was, but nothing seemed to happen. But now I know something did happen. The spell has changed the Elements of Harmony! That must be why their cutie marks are all wrong!
313005 So just cast a counter-spell to switch them back.
313003 Oh. There is no counter-spell!
313005 Why don't you just use that memory spell you used to fix everypony when Discord was here?
313003 It's not their memories, Spike. It's their true selves that have been altered!
313005 Zecora's cure for the cutie pox?
313003 That won't work either...
313005 Well [sighs], maybe it won't be so bad. Maybe our friends will grow to like their new lives.
313003 No, Spike. They're not who they are meant to be anymore. Their destinies are now changed, and it's all my fault.
313003 [Twilight Sparkle]
313003 I have to find a way
313003 To make this all okay
313003 I can't believe this small mistake
313003 Could've caused so much heartache
313003 Oh why, oh why?
313003 Losing promise
313003 I don't know what to do
313003 Seeking answers
313003 I fear I won't get through to you
313003 Oh why, oh why?
313003 Oh, Spike, what have I done?
313005 Aw, come on, Twilight, you'll figure out a way to fix this. These are your friends.
313003 You're right, Spike. And they mean more to me than anything. My friends...
313005 Twilight? Are you alright?
313003 I've got it! I know what to do!
313005 You do?
313003 I may not be able to remind them of who they are, but I can show them what they mean to each other. They'll find the part of themselves that's been lost so they can help the friend they care about so much! Come on, Spike!
313000 [bits clinking]
313003 Fluttershy, wait!
31300e Oh... Hey, Twilight...
313003 Where are you going?
31300e I'm moving back to Cloudsdale. I don't know what's wrong, but I can't seem to make anypony laugh.
313000 [whoopee cushion deflating]
313003 Before you go, I was wondering if you might be willing to help Rainbow Dash. She's really struggling with her animals.
31300e But... I don't really know anything about animals...
313003 But you do know something about Rainbow Dash.
31300e I... know that she's a true friend, and I'll do anything I can to help her.
313000 [thunk]
31300c [muffled] Whoa!
313003 Rainbow Dash!
31300c I'm in here! Help! I'm trapped!
31300e Hurry, Twilight! Can't you do some sort of spell to get her out?
313003 No. Fluttershy, you're the only one who can help! Rainbow Dash needs you!
31300e Um... Hello? Little... woodland creatures? I know that you're all very upset and feel like giving Rainbow Dash a hard time, but we'd all really appreciate it if you'd calm down and, um, maybe... rest for a bit? Oh! Uh... look! Here's some nice, juicy leaves for you to munch on. And some crunchy, munchy acorns too. Uh, wouldn't you like to take a break and have a little snack?
313000 [cutlery clinking]
313000 [animals eating]
31300e Aww, look at that. I guess you were all just cranky because you were hungry. Oh, you are very welcome, little friends.
3130ee [kisses]
31300e Goodness, it's like I can understand them! I... I feel strange, like... like this is what I'm meant to do, like this is who I am! My destiny! Wha... what happened?
313003 Fluttershy, look! Your cutie mark!
313003 It worked! It worked! Oh, I'm so happy you're back to normal! Now we need your help!
313003 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313003 A friend will be there to help them see
313000 [Twilight and Fluttershy]
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 To see the light that shines from a true, true friend
31300c Um, hello? Friend trapped inside, remember?
313003 [Twilight Sparkle]
313003 Rarity needs your help
313003 She's trying hard, doing what she can
31300e [Fluttershy]
31300e Would you try, just give it a chance?
31300e You might find that you'll start to understand
313000 [Twilight and Fluttershy]
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 A friend will be there to help you see
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 To see the light that shines from a true, true friend
31300c Uh, what just happened?
313003 There's no time to explain, but we need your help. Applejack's trying to make dresses!
31300c Say no more!
31300c [Rainbow Dash]
31300c Applejack needs your help
31300c She's trying hard, doing what she can
31300c Would you try, just give it a chance?
31300c You might find that you'll start to understand
313000 [Twilight, Fluttershy, and Rainbow Dash]
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 A friend will be there to help them see
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 To see the light that shines from a true, true friend
31300d [gasps] Oh my, what a terrible dream I had. Or, maybe I'm still having it.
313003 Rarity, Pinkie Pie is about to lose the apple farm. We need Applejack's help!
31300d Lose the apple farm? Well we can't let that happen, now can we?
31300d [Rarity]
31300d Pinkie Pie is in trouble
31300d We need to get there by her side
31300d We can try to do what we can now
31300d For together we can be her guide
313000 [Twilight, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity]
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 A friend will be there to help them see
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need
313000 To see the light that shines from a true, true friend
313008 Yee-haw! Now that's more like it! What's next?
313003 The townspeople are furious. We need the old Pinkie Pie back.
313008 I'm on it. I know just the thing.
313008 [Applejack]
313008 The townspeople need you
313008 They've been sad for a while
313008 They march around, face a-frown
313008 And never seem to smile
313008 And if you feel like helpin'
313008 We'd appreciate a lot
313008 If you'd get up there and spread some cheer
313008 From here to Canterlot
313007 Come on ponies, I wanna see you SMILE!
3130ec PINKIE!
313000 [Mane Six and crowd]
313000 A true, true friend helps a friend in need

313000 To see the light! (To see the light!)
313000 That shines! (That shines!)
313000 From a true, true friend!
313003 [echoing] A mark of one's destiny, singled out alone, fulfilled. [normal] [gasps] Wait a second, that's it! I understand now! I know how to fix the spell!
313003 From all of us together, together we're friends. With the marks of our destinies made one, there is magic without end!
313025 [cries of shock]
31300e [gasps] What happened?
313015 [exclamations of shock]
313003 [echoing] Hello? Where am I? What is this place?
313019 [echoing] Congratulations, Twilight. I knew you could do it.
313003 [echoing] Princess... I don't understand. What did I do?
313019 You did something today that's never been done before. Something even a great unicorn like Star Swirl the Bearded was not able to do, because he did not understand friendship like you do. The lessons you've learned here in Ponyville have taught you well. You have proven that you're ready, Twilight.
313003 Ready? Ready for what?
313019 [Princess Celestia]
313019 You've come such a long, long way
313019 And I've watched you from that very first day
313019 To see how you might grow
313019 To see what you might do
313019 To see what you've been through
313019 And all the ways you've made me proud of you
313019 It's time now for a new change to come
313019 You've grown up and your new life has begun
313019 To go where you will go
313019 To see what you will see
313019 To find what you will be
313019 For it's time for you to fulfill your destiny
313008 Twilight? Is that you?
313024 [gasps]
313008 Wha... I-I've never seen anything like it!
31300c Ha! Twilight's got wings! Awesome! A new flying buddy! [laughs]
31300d Why, you've become an Alicorn. I didn't even know that was possible.
313007 [shouting] Alicorn party! [blows party horn]
313000 [crowd cheering]
31300e Wow... You look just like a princess!
313019 That's because she is a princess.
313012 Huh?
313007 Hold on a second! [drinks] [spits]
313003 A... A princess?
313019 Since you've come to Ponyville, you've displayed the charity, compassion, devotion, integrity, optimism, and of course, the leadership of a true princess.
313003 But... does this mean I won't be your student anymore?
313019 Not in the same way as before. I'll still be here to help and guide you, but we're all your students now, too. You are an inspiration to us all, Twilight.
313003 But... what do I do now? Is there a book about being a princess I should read?
313019 [giggles] There will be time for all of that later.
313019 We are gathered here today in celebration of a momentous occasion. My most faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, has done many extraordinary things since she's lived in Ponyville. She even helped reunite me with my sister, Princess Luna. But today, Twilight Sparkle did something extraordinary. She created new magic, proving without a doubt that she is ready to be crowned Equestria's newest princess. Fillies and gentlecolts, may I present for the very first time, Princess Twilight Sparkle!
313000 [Choir]
313000 The Princess Twilight cometh
313000 Behold, behold
313000 A Princess here before us
313000 Behold, behold, behold
313000 Behold, behold (behold, behold)
313000 The Princess Twilight cometh
313000 Behold, behold (behold, behold)
313000 The Princess is
313000 The Princess is here!
313000 [crowd cheering]
313019 Say something, Princess.
313003 Oh. Um... [clears throat] A little while ago, my teacher and mentor Princess Celestia sent me to live in Ponyville. She sent me to study friendship, which is something I didn't really care much about. But now, on a day like today, I can honestly say I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for the friendships I've made with all of you. Each one of you taught me something about friendship, and for that, I will always be grateful. Today, I consider myself the luckiest pony in Equestria. Thank you, friends. Thank you, everypony!
313000 [crowd cheering]
313193 Twilight! I'm so proud of you!
313003 Are you crying?
313193 Of course not. It's... it's liquid pride. Totally different thing.
3131f9 [laughing]
313008 Way to go, Princess!
313007 Best coronation day ever!
31300e We love you, Twilight.
313003 I love you too, girls!
313003 [Twilight Sparkle]
313003 Life in Equestria shimmers
313003 Life in Equestria shines
313003 And I know for absolute certain
313000 [Mane Six and crowd]
313000 That everything (that everything)
313000 Yes, everything (yes, everything)
313000 Yes, everything is certainly fine
313000 It’s fine
313003 Yes! Everything’s going to be just fine!
313000 ["A True, True Friend" plays over credits]
40100c You gotta really flap 'em hard.
401003 [grunts] Whoa!
40100c Uh, maybe not quite that hard.
401003 Whoa! Oof!
401008 Lookin' good up there, Princess Twilight.
401003 Applejack, you know you don't have to call me that.
40100d Why do you protest so? You've already given up wearing your crown all the time. The least you can do is embrace your new title.
401003 If other ponies want to address me that way, I suppose it's fine, but... not my friends. It just doesn't feel right. [sigh] And neither does all this flying business. The Summer Sun Celebration is only two days away, and I'm never gonna be ready to perform my part.
40100c Not if you spend all your time down here, you won't! Now get up there and show everypony the big finish!
40101f [cheering]
401003 Woo-hoo! Whaaaa! Oof! Oof! [coughs] [screams]
401007 Wow! That was a big finish!
401003 [groans]
401000 [theme song]
40100d You look amazing, darling. They've really captured your regality.
401003 I suppose.
40100d Oh, don't be so modest. It's everypony's dream to someday wear a crown and have their coronation ceremony preserved in stained glass for all to see. [sighs]
40100c I don't know if it's everypony's dream.
401007 Most of my dreams are about frosting! [slurp] Ohohohoho...
40100e We'd better get going. We don't want to miss our train.
401008 Fluttershy's right. Don't know about y'all, but I've still got bushels to do to get ready. The official celebration may be here in Canterlot, but hoo-wee, has the Mayor put us in charge of one heck of a party back home. Aw, don't look like that, sugarcube. You get to be right there with the other Princesses when Celestia raises the sun.
401003 And I'm honored. Really, I am. It's just that the Summer Sun Celebration is what first brought us all together. It just doesn't feel right not getting to spend such a special day with my Ponyville friends.
40100d It doesn't feel right to us either, darling. If the Mayor wasn't so desperate for our assistance, we'd most certainly stay here in Canterlot. And of course we do understand that your royal duties must come first.
401008 The Summer Sun Celebration may have brought us together, but it's something much bigger that'll always keep us connected. Exhibit A - The six of us are united by the Elements of Harmony. No amount of royal duties is gonna change that. Right, everypony?
401013 [general agreement]
401008 Right, Pinkie Pie?
401007 Creamy, creamy frosting... [chuckles]
40100e You should take that as a yes.
401000 [train whistle blows]
401007 We're gonna write you and give you so many details, it'll be like you're in Ponyville with us! Right, girls?
401053 Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye.
40100d And you will be with us right after the Celebration. We already have an appointment on the books to discuss the royal upgrades to your loft decor.
401000 [train whistle blows]
4011f3 All aboard for Ponyville!
40101f [giggling]
401007 Whee!
401000 [train chugging]
401003 [exhales] I can't help it, Spike. They've only been gone a minute, and I already feel like I'm missing something.
4011d4 For the Princess.
401005 [reading] Dear Twilight, you aren't missing anything. Your friend, Pinkie Pie.
401007 [in the distance] That's me!
40101f [laughing]
401003 But I am. I just know it.
401005 Check, check, check, check, and... check! Huh, whaddaya know? We're way ahead of schedule! I credit your extremely competent assistant.
401003 So do I.
401005 The Celebration isn't until the day after tomorrow. We could still fit in a quick trip to Ponyville and be back in plenty of time to finish off these last few things before the main event!
401003 [sighs] That would be nice, Spike, but what if something else came up while we were gone? What if we were delayed getting back and I wasn't able to finish everything on that list? What if we lost the list on the way to Ponyville and then couldn't remember which things we'd done and which things we hadn't done, and then spent so much time trying to figure out what we hadn't done and what we had done, and we ruined the entire Celebration by not doing the one really important thing that we were supposed to do?!
401000 [thud]
401005 Uh... so that's a 'no' then?
401003 These are the first royal duties Princess Celestia has given me. I can't risk letting her down!
401019 And I'm sure you won't.
401005 Your highness!
401019 No need for that now, Princess Twilight.
401003 Sorry.
401019 [giggles] No need to apologize.
401003 Sorry!
401019 I must admit that it is wonderful to actually be looking forward to the Summer Sun Celebration.
401003 What do you mean?
401019 For my subjects, it has always been a celebration of my defeat of Nightmare Moon. But for me... [sighs] It was just a terrible reminder that I'd had to banish my own sister.
401003 I guess I never really thought about it that way.
401019 But now it has become a wonderful reminder of her transformation back into Princess Luna, and our happy reunion. I am so pleased that you will be playing a role in the festivities. I know it must have been difficult to see your friends return to Ponyville without you.
401003 Maybe a little.
401019 You may no longer be my student, Princess Twilight, but I hope you know that I will always be here if you need me. Just as I hope that you will always be there when I need you.
401005 [clears throat] I think this guy needs you?
4011d4 Uh, a message for Princess Twilight.
401000 [party popper going off]
401019 A letter from Ponyville, I presume?
401003 Never mind. It's not important. Spike, where were we?
401005 About to call it a night?
401003 We should probably go over the checklist one more time.
401005 I knew you were gonna say that...
401019 I'll leave you to it.
401019 [gasps] [yelps]
401003 Huh?! Spike?
401005 [snores] Check-check-check-check-check-check...
401003 Spike!
401005 Ungh... What time is it?
401003 It's the middle of the night! But it could be morning. That's just it! I can't tell!
401005 Whoa. That is weird.
401003 Come on, Spike, we have to find out what's going on.
401000 [ponies chattering]
401034 What do you think it means?!
401096 Princess Twilight will know!
401000 [ponies chattering]
401003 I'm-I'm sure it's just... Well, there's certainly a logical ex–
4011a6 Your Highness, you must come with us.
401000 [doors slam]
4011a6 It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia.
4011a7 They're gone!
401049 [gasp]
401003 But I don't understand! Where are they?
4011a6 We don't know. It seems that Princess Celestia and Princess Luna have simply... vanished.
401005 Vanished?!
401000 [thud]
4011a6 This is why we have come to you.
4011a7 We await your command.
401003 My command?!
4011a7 We're officers of the Royal Guard. We take our orders from royalty. With Princess Luna and Princess Celestia gone, and Princess Cadance overseeing the Crystal Empire now, that means we take our orders from you.
401000 [thud]
4011a7 Princess Twilight, there's no time to waste. We need to know what you want us to do.
401003 I want you to continue the search for Princess Luna and Princess Celestia. We have to find them before ponies start to panic. There must be some clue that can tell us what's happened to them. If you find something, anything, let me know immediately. [exhales]
401005 Way to take charge, Twilight.
401000 [doors slam]
4011fa Your highness! News from Ponyville! The Everfree Forest appears to be... well... invading!
401003 [gasps]
401000 [thud]
401000 [animals chattering]
40100e Excuse me... Oh, pardon me... Are you all right? My goodness, what is it that has caused you all such distress?
4010ee [grunts]
40100e Whatever it is, I'm sure it's nothing you need to really worry about. [screams] Oh, no, you were right. You should be worried! Very, very worried!
401009 [grunting]
401000 [snap]
401008 Come on, y'all! Put your backs into it! [grunts]
401000 [stretching noises]
401026 Eeyup. [chomp] Nope. Eeyup. [chomp] Nope. Eeyup. [chomp]
401000 [thud]
401026 ...Nope.
401008 [straining] Dagnabbit, we ain't never seen this kind of trouble with weeds before. Now that I think about it, I've never seen these kinds of weeds at all! Have y'all?
401026 Nope.
401008 Where the heck are these things comin' from? And what in tarnation is goin' on with the sky?!
40100c Oh, no, you don't! This is Ponyville territory, and we aren't due for rain until after the Summer Sun Celebration. You Everfree clouds need to just head on back to where you belong! Whoa! [yelps] Gonna make me do this the hard way, huh? [yelping] Hey!
40100d [humming] Hmm. Something strange about the sky.
401000 [tea trickling]
401000 [splash]
40100d What in the name of calming chamomile is going on?!
40106a [yowls]
40100d Opalescence, darling, I'm so sorry! I promise I am not doing this on purpose!
401000 [hiss]
401000 [smashing crockery]
40100d It wasn't me, I swear!
40106a [growls]
40100d Ooh, Sweetie Belle! If this is some sort of prank you and your little Crusader friends are pulling, I find very little humor in it!
401066 Rarity, you have to help me! I think something's wrong with my horn!
401000 [thud]
401066 [grunts] [yelps]
40100d [gasps]
401066 [screams]
40100d [yelps]
401005 Where are we going?!
401003 The Everfree Forest is... 'invading'. Whatever is going on, I'm sure we're going to need our friends and the Elements of Harmony to stop it! I just hope we haven't missed the train...
401005 [gasps] [short on breath] Twilight? There is another way for us to get to Ponyville, remember?
401003 There is?
401005 Huah! You can fly!
401003 Oh. Right!
401000 [car engine starting and sputtering]
401003 Whoa!
401000 [Wilhelm scream, other ponies scream]
40100d Something very strange is going on, and- [gasps] I for one would appreciate an explanation!
40100c All I know is the sky's split in two, and these clouds moving in sure aren't from around here.
401008 Neither are all these crazy plants! They're comin' from the Everfree Forest! And try as we might, us Earth ponies can't do anythin' to get rid of 'em! Don't suppose you know any magic that might stop 'em from spreadin'?
40100d Alas, this whole raging forest situation seems to have left my horn on the fritz!
40100e We have to figure out something! I don't know how much more of this Ponyville can take! [yelps] I don't know how much more I can take!
401008 The forest is expandin', y'all, and judgin' by how fast it's movin', it doesn't seem content just takin' over Ponyville... I reckon before long, it'll cover half of Equestria!
401000 [plants creaking]
401003 [unsure noises]

401005 I'm starting to wish... we'd taken the train!
401003 Almost there! Come on, Spike, we need to get the Elements of Harmony and find the others!
401005 Incoming!
401003 Whoa! Aah!
401000 [thonk]
40100d Oh, thank goodness!
40100e Oh, I hope you know we wouldn't normally go through your books without permission...
401000 [door opens]
401005 Sweet ground! [kissing noises] Sweet, sweet, wonderful ground!
401003 Okay, I get it! I need to work on my flying!
401007 I dunno if you've noticed, but the Everfree Forest is just a teeny-tiny bit out of control.
40100d [groans]
401008 Guess it turned out you were missin' something here in Ponyville after all.
40100d But perhaps you already know what's causing all of this calamity. Has Princess Celestia sent you to dispel it posthaste?
401003 Not exactly. You see, Princess Celestia is, well... she and Princess Luna are both...
401005 They're missing!
4010da [gasps]
401003 I don't know who has taken them, but I've got a hunch we're going to need the Elements of Harmony to get them back.
40100c Oh, yeah, just like old times.
401007 A-boo-yah!
401008 I told ya we'd always be connected by the Elements. [sighs] Now we just gotta figure out who to aim these bad boys at so we can get Celestia and Luna back and keep the rest of Equestria from becoming plant food! Any ideas?
401003 Hmm...
401007 I haven't found squat in any of the books I've been looking through! Oopsies! Missed a spot!
401000 [scribbling]
401003 Half day, half night... strange weather patterns... out of control plants. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.
401000 [magical whirling noises]
4010db [singing] Winter Wrap Up, Winter Wrap-ooh! [laughs] Now, Twilight, you know Princess Celestia said that you were to give me a heads up before you summon me with that little spell she gave you. In case you haven't noticed, I was in the middle of a particularly invigorating shower.
401003 E-nough! Release Princess Celestia and Princess Luna, and stop the Everfree Forest from invading!
4010db Why, [chuckles] whatever are you talking about?
401008 Don't you play dumb with us, Discord! We know you're the one behind all of this!
4010db Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love what you've done with the place, but I couldn't possibly take responsibility. I'm reformed, don't you remember?
40100c Yeah, right! This has got your cloven hoofprints all over it!
4010db I'll have you know that I have only one cloven hoof. Such accusations. And here I thought we were friends.
401007 Drop the act, buster! We're onto you!
4010db Ladies, ladies, I'm innocent. Would I lie to you?
401015 Yes!
40100e Um, maybe?
4010db Well then, it seems we've reached an impasse. I'm telling the truth, but you think I'm lying. What do friends like us do in a situation like this, Princess Twilight? Congrats, by the way, on the promotion. You totally deserve it.
40100c I say we blast him back to stone!
401008 Works for me!
40100d Hear, hear!
40100e Hey! We can't do that! What if he really is telling the truth?
4010db Well, finally! Somepony willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. The rest of you could learn a lot about friendship from my dear friend Shutterfly here.
40100e Um, it's Fluttershy.
4010db Oh, right, whatever.
401003 If you're not the one responsible, then help us figure out who is!
4010db I suppose I could, but after all the hoof pointing and besmirching of my good name, I just don't know if I'm up to it.
401000 [knitting needles clacking]
401003 Rrrgh!
4010db Why don't you ask your zebra friend if she knows anything?
401003 Zecora!
401047 From my home, I have had to flee! The forest has grown too wild, even for me!
401008 Any idea why all this is happenin'?
401047 I'm afraid it is a mystery to me as well, but I may have something that, if combined with a spell... I do not dare to use it myself, the results would be tragic. It only responds to Alicorn magic. Princess Twilight, you can turn the potion from purple to white. After a sip, you may see why the sky is day and night.
401003 [straining]
401007 Oooh!
401003 [drinking] Doesn't seem to be worki-
401003 Where am I?
40101a Not... another step!
401003 Princess Luna! I don't understand. Where are we? Why did you and Celestia disappear?
40101a Did you really expect me to sit idly by while they all basked in your precious light?
401003 Precious light?
40101a There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess... will be me!
401000 [rumbling]
401011 [evil laughter]
401000 [To be continued...]
401000 [credits]
402000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
4021fb It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia.
402005 They're missing!
402003 The Everfree Forest is... invading. I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.
4020db I'm reformed. Don't you remember? Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
402047 You can turn the potion from purple to white. You may see why the sky is day and night.
402003 Princess Luna!
40201a There can only be one princess in Equestria! And that princess will be me!
402011 [laughing]
402000 [theme song]
402011 [laughing]
402000 [crashing]
402003 Luna! Think of how long you were banished to the moon! You'll give us no choice but to send you back there if you don't stop!
402019 Luna, I will not fight you! You must lower the moon! It is your duty!
402011 Luna? I am... Nightmare Moon! I have but one royal duty now - to destroy you! And where do you think you're going?
402019 [screams]
402003 Celestia!
402011 [laughing]
402003 No... Why would Luna do this? Why now? [crying] You're all right. You're all right! Princess Celestia?
402019 Oh, dear sister. I am sorry, but you have given me no choice but to use these.
402000 [rumbling and clanking]
402003 Are those the Elements of Harmony? But that's how they looked in... the past. This is the night you banished her.
402011 Nooooooo!
402003 Why are you all looking at me like that?
402008 It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself...
402007 Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!
40200e We were really worried about you.
4020db I for one found it delightful. Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will. You should really consider taking it on the road.
40200c Did you find out whose rump we need to kick and where we can find them?
402003 I saw something from a long time ago. But it didn't explain what's happening now.
402047 Perhaps farther back still are the answers you seek. Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.
402005 You sure about this?
402003 [gulping]
4020db Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!
4020db Oh, this is so much fun. How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?
402019 [gasp] Play time is over for you, Discord.
4020db Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? Suit yourselves. Oh! What have you got there?
402019 The Elements of Harmony.
40201a With them, we shall defeat you.
402003 This must be when they turned Discord into stone.
4020db [laughing] You should see yourselves right now. The expressions on your face. So intense. So sure of yourselves. [laughing] Hilarious!
402003 [gasp]
40201a [gasp] The Tree of Harmony.
402003 The Tree of Harmony? My cutie mark.
40201a Are you sure?
402019 We have managed to discover the only means by which we can defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria. Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here.
402005 So what did you find out?
402003 I still don't know what's happened to Princess Luna and Princess Celestia, but I think I know why the Everfree Forest is acting this way. Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony.
40200c The tree of what now?
402003 It's where Princess Celestia and Princess Luna found the Elements. I think it's in danger.
402008 Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree. Uh... where is it exactly?
402003 I think it's in... there.
4020db Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
40200d Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these woods to find the Elements of Harmony.
402003 Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to think I should go after them on my own. I don't know what we're going to face in there. But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together.
40204d [agreeing]
402003 We can use those to cross. [yelps]
40200d [gasps] A cragadile! Run for your lives!
4021fc [roars]
40201f [grunting]
402003 That was close.
402008 [sighs] A little too close, if you ask me. You sure you're all right?
402003 I'm fine. I just can't seem to get these new wings to do what I want them to do when I want them to do it.
40200c Aw, you'll figure it out eventually.
402003 "Eventually" isn't soon enough.
402008 You have been having an awful lot of trouble with those things. And, well, who knows what else is gonna come after us? You know, maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea for Twilight to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her.
402003 What? Why?
402008 For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly.
402003 We all did. He wasn't after just me.
402008 Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses.
402003 What's that got to do with anything?
402008 Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone. If something happened to you, I-I just don't think Equestria can risk losing another princess.
40200d Applejack does make a valid point. Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony, it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return. Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence.
402003 But the Tree of Harmony! I'm the only one who has seen it and knows what it looks like.
40200c Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk, probably being attacked by something hideously awful? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it.
402003 All of you feel this way? Feel like I shouldn't be here?
40200e It is probably for the best.
4020db [humming]
4021fd Help! Help!
402003 Discord!
4020db You're welcome! Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
402003 We ran into some trouble. And my friends decided it would be best if I returned to Ponyville while they continue the search. Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return.
4020db I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan. I never thought you'd be the kind of pony who would think she was better than everypony else.
402003 I don't think I'm better than anypony!
4020db Oh, well, how silly of me to assume that you would think that. All you did was choose to keep your precious princess self out of harm's way while your friends thrust themselves right into it. I'm sure you'll all be the best of pals again when they return from their terrifying yet deeply bonding experience that they're having without you. [chuckles]
402003 I never should have agreed to come back here.
402005 Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed. He's just trying to get under your skin.
402003 Well, it's working!
40200c Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause? We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle. Maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real. Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybe–
402008 Maybe it's right down there.
40200c [gasp] It can't be!
40200d How are we supposed to get to it?
402007 Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Take the stairs, silly!
402005 Are we there yet?
402003 I don't know where we are. We're lost. I never should have left my friends.
402005 We can't just give up. Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em. Well, what do you know? Twilight?
402003 [coughing]
402005 [gasp]
40200e [gasp] I think it's dying!
402008 So let's save it already! [grunting]
40200c Nice try. Heh- Whoa! Oof!
40200d Valiant efforts on both your parts, but the tree remains in jeopardy.
402008 And I suppose you've got a better idea? That's what I thought.
40200e I know who would know what to do. But we sent her home.
40200c It was your idea, Applejack!
402008 We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash! We were tryin' to protect her.
402005 Oof! Ow! Ugh!
402000 [whinny]
402005 Twilight! Trouble! Help!
4021fe [screech]
402008 Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons! You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!
402007 [blows party horn]
4021fe [screech]
40200c Up here!
402007 Yoo-hoo! Come and get me!
40200d Don't forget about me!
402007 Ta-da!
4021fe [roar]
402008 I sure am glad you came looking for us.
402003 Not as glad as I am that you found me.
40200d The truth of it is, Twilight, we're simply lost without you.
40200c Yeah. Equestria may need its princess...
40200e ...But we need our friend.
402003 [gasp] [yelps]
402019 [voice over] Even without these elements, the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic. As long as that magic remains, it will continue to control and contain all that grows here.
402003 I know how we can save the tree. We have to give it the Elements of Harmony.
40200c Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are we supposed to protect Equestria?
40200d How are we meant to rein Discord in if we can't use the Elements to turn him back to stone?
402008 Twilight... The Elements of Harmony... They're what keep us connected no matter what.
402003 You're right about one thing, Applejack. The Elements of Harmony did bring us together. But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected. It's our friendship. And it's more important and more powerful than any magic. My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities, and our friendships may be tested, but it will never, ever be broken. There's no time to lose. Everypony ready?
40201f Ready! [gasp]
402000 [whirring]
4020db [thud] Oh, poo.
402019 We know how difficult it must have been for you to give up the Elements. It took great courage to relinquish them.
402003 What's inside it? How am I supposed to open it?
40201a Six locks, six keys.
402019 I do not know where they are. But I do know that it is a mystery you will not be solving alone.
402000 [party horn]
4020db Bravo, ladies, bravo! How ever did you save the day this time? Blast the beastie with your magic necklaces, I presume? Where are those little trinkets of yours? You know, the ones you use to send me back to my extremely uncomfortable stone prison?
402008 [sigh] Gone.
4020db Gone? Gone?
40200e But our friendship remains. And if you want to remain friends, you'll stop thinking whatever it is you're thinking and help us clean up.
4020db Fine. But I don't do windows.
402008 One thing I don't get. Why did all this happen now?
4020db I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
402003 What did you say?!
4020db Oh, why should I try to explain it when you can see for yourself?
402003 [gulping]
402019 Play time is over for you, Discord!
4020db Oh, I doubt that. [munching] Hungry? [voice over] Well, obviously things didn't go according to my original plan. My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and Princess Luna thousands of moons ago. Alas, it seems the tree had enough magic to keep the seeds from growing up big and strong. Until now, that is.
402003 You realize this is information we could have used hours ago?!
4020db And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess? What kind of friend do you think I am?
402000 [snap]
402000 [trumpet fanfare]
402019 Citizens of Equestria, it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great joy that I raise the summer sun. For this celebration now represents not the defeat of Nightmare Moon, but the return of my sister, Princess Luna.
402000 [ponies cheering]
402000 [music]
402000 [credits]
403003 [groan]
403000 [whap]
403005 What's wrong, Twilight?
403003 Ugh, I've gone through every book in Ponyville, Spike, and there isn't a single mention of the mysterious chest that came from the Tree of Harmony, nor anything about keys to unlock it! But something tells me that opening it is pretty important. I hope Princess Celestia has some ideas. If the library in Canterlot doesn't have anything, I-I don't know where else to look!
403005 [yelp] [belch]
403003 [reading] My dearest Twilight, while it would be perfectly lovely to have you in Canterlot once more, I have another option in mind much closer to Ponyville.
403019 [voice over] As you know, the ancient castle that I once shared with Princess Luna lies mostly in ruins, deep in the Everfree Forest. But if you look carefully, you may find a book that could prove helpful to your research, hidden somewhere in what's left of the castle library.
403003 [gasp] Wow! Look at all these ancient books! It's a veritable goldmine of information! I can't believe it! Woo-hoo!
403005 Whoa, whoa-whoa! Oof! [yelp] Uh, heh-heh. So, uh, Twilight. Uh, ready to head home?
403003 Are you kidding? This place is perfect!
403005 [teeth chattering]
403000 [spiders scuttling]
403000 [theme song]
403000 [bees buzzing]
40300c I'm not gonna move. You move.
403008 Uh-uh. There is no way I'm movin'.
403007 This is the most daring dare anypony ever dared dare another pony to dare!
40301d Huh?
403007 It's exciting!
403000 [pop]
403000 [bee buzzing]
403140 Uh, whatcha'll doing?
403007 Rainbow Dash and Applejack are competing for the title of "Most Daring Pony"! This is the final test - the Bee Stare! Last pony to blink wins!
403140 ... I'm gonna need my bees back.
40300c But then we'll never find out who the Most Daring Pony is!
403140 Eh, sorry about that. [whistles]
403000 [buzzing stops]
403008 Well, what do we do now?
403007 Don't worry, ladies, I've been keeping excellent score all day! [quietly] Hmm, move the decimal, carry the 2, and... [aloud] Congratulations! You're tied!
403008 Tied?
40300c You can't be tied for the Most Daring Pony!
403007 I dunno! Numbers don't lie! I'd love to stay and keep keeping score, but I promised to help test the new school bell. I get to ring it all week, nonstop! And I don't even have to take turns, because no one else volunteered! [giggles]
40300c Okay, no problem. We just have to come up with another daring dare.
403008 Right. I think I might have an idea of what we can do.
40300e Um, Rarity? Don't you think it's a little late in the day to be walking through the forest? It is... star-spider season, after all. Though, I'm sure you have a very good reason.
40300d Simply the most important reason I've ever had in my entire life!
40300e Oh, well then I'm happy to help. What is it?
40300d I've heard rumors that the Castle of the Two Sisters is filled with the most gorgeous of ancient tapestries in all of pony history! It pains me to think of those magnificent creations rotting away in those old ruins, totally unappreciated.
40300e I see...
40300d I require your help in borrowing one or two to bring back to the boutique where I can restore them. Maybe I'll even use the patterns as the inspiration for a new line!
40300e That does sound... very important.
40300d Yes, well, [clears throat] maybe not the most important thing in my entire life, but retro-ancient classical will be all the rage next season, so it's nothing to sneeze at. [sneezes]
40300e Um, are you sure you need those tapestries?
40300d But, of course. Although, I must admit these ruins are a fright. Just look at all the dirt everywhere! Ugh...
40300e [gasp] Angel!
40300d Goodness! It's practically an artistic treasure trove of ancient good taste! [sigh]
40300e Angel! Oh, you really shouldn't have run off like that. Ancient ruins are filled with all sorts of things that can hurt you! You could stub your toe, or, or trip on a loose stone... You have to be careful!
403005 I don't think I'll need all these candles, Twilight. I was really only scared for a second.
403003 Oh, these aren't for you, Spike. We're gonna be studying late into the night, and we're gonna need all the light we can get.
403005 Oh, great.
403008 Well, here we are!
40300c Uh, what's so daring about this place? This is where we got the Elements of Harmony.
403008 When I was just a filly, Granny Smith told me of an ancient legend. When Nightmare Moon was banished, not every last bit of her dark magic went with her. Granny used to say, when night falls on the castle, that magic takes the form of... the Pony of Shadows!
40300c You mean, like a ghost?
403008 [spookily] Nopony knows!
40300c Ugh.
40300d [excited gasp] This one is perfect!
40300e Well, it certainly could use some restoration.
40300d Be a dear, fly up there and lift it off that hook?
40300e [grunts]
40300d [calling out] Maybe from below?
403000 [clattering and shuffling]
40300c I don't see what's so daring about an old legend. Plus, I don't believe in ghosts.
403008 You might wanna rethink your position on that.
40300e [scared yelling]
40301d [yelling] [screaming]
40301d [screaming]
403008 You saw that, right?
40300c Run!
403000 [clattering and shuffling]
40300e Ow... I think I hurt my wing.
40300d Oh, my dear, I am so sorry! That tapestry is far too heavy. We'll just have to find a smaller one.
40300e Oh, of course.
40300d Where, pray tell, did you disappear to?
40300e What do you mean?
40300d While you were struggling under that fabric, the entire wall spun around! You must have activated a secret door.
40300e Oh, I'm sorry.
40300d I suppose these ruins are chock full of them.
40300e Really?
40300d Absolutely. We must use the utmost care as we—
40307e [yelp]
403000 [clunk]
40300c [panting] Okay, so, maybe the legend is true!
403008 Well, that's why I brought you here! I guess only the most daring pony of all could stay in this castle all night without being scared off.
403000 [screech]
40300c Scared? I'm not scared!
403008 Well, m-me neither!
40300c Then it's settled! Whoever stays in the castle the longest is the Most Daring Pony.
403008 Deal.
403000 [clop]
40300c But it's gonna take a lot more than some shadowy ghost pony to get me to leave.
403008 Me too! Humph!
403003 Find anything, Spike?
403005 Uh, nope. Nothing yet.
403000 [boing]
403005 Aaah!
403003 Angel? What are you doing here?
403000 [whoosh, clatter]
403003 [gasp] Whoa! [reading] The Journal of the Two Sisters. [gasp] Maybe this is the book Princess Celestia was talking about!
40300c I sure hope you're not afraid of the dark, Applejack!
403008 I can't say that I am! But even if I was, I'd be at least fifty percent less scared of it than you, Rainbow Dash.
40300c I dunno how all that math works because I'm not scared at all!
403008 Me neither!
403000 [whoosh]
403008 Huh?
40300c W-what's the matter? It's just a dark hallway full of... disembodied pony legs.
403008 Yeah. Nothin'... creepy about that.
40300d I'm starting to wonder if maybe this castle doesn't want my expertise!
40300e Oh dear. Angel? Rarity, have you seen him?
40300d I'm not sure he made the trip down with us, dear.
40300e Oh, goodness! We have to find him. An ancient castle is no place for a bunny. He could get hit by falling debris, or the floor could give out under him! Oh! He could be trapped in a dark place with no way out!
40300d [flatly] I can only imagine how that might feel. Hmm...
40300c Applejack, if you're scared, you can just admit it. You don't need to put your hoof around me.
403008 Uh, I'm over here.
40300c [scream]
403008 [scream]
40301d [both screaming]
40300d [gasp]
40300e Rarity! What is it?
40300d I felt something... alive!
40300e [gasp] Angel!
403000 [rattle, spin]
40300d Well, tapestries or no, I have had just about enough of secret passages, mysterious presences, and unappreciative castles! [echoes]
40300e But we can't leave now, not with Angel lost somewhere in this dangerous old castle! He could be trapped under a crumbling statue, or stuck high in a tower without food or water or any friends at all!
403040 [munching]
403003 Spike, you've got to hear this. [reading] I love to duck behind the paintings, and though the Hall of Hooves still gives her a bit of a fright, the trap door slide is Luna's favorite.
403005 "Hall of Hooves"?
403003 [reading] Soon the Organ to the Outside will be finished. I can hardly wait.
403005 What's the "Organ to the Outside"?
403003 [happily] I have no idea!
403000 [organ music]
403000 [crash]
403008 You hear that?
40300c You mean, the creepy sound of a haunted pipe organ?
403008 Uh... maybe?
40300c [worried] I don't know what you're talking about!
403000 [organ music, whinny]
403005 Uh, Twilight? Did you hear something?
403003 Oh, Spike. Quit being such a scaredy-dragon. This castle is thousands of years old, and half of it was destroyed by Nightmare Moon. Of course it makes strange sounds. It's practically falling apart!
403000 [clatter]
403040 [giggles]
403005 Oh... kay.
40300e [calling] Angel! Angel!
40300d I'm sure we'll find him.
40300e Angel?
40300d [hysterical yelling]
40300e Did you find Angel? Is he okay?
40300d [gasp] They are perfect! No castle in its right mind could possibly object to my restoring such exquisite works of art.
40300e Oh! They're lovely, Rarity, but... I have to keep looking for Angel. Oh, I hope he doesn't think I've given up on him.
40300d I'm right behind you! Won't... [grunts] be... [grunts] a moment!
403008 Do you think there's a single room in this castle that isn't filled with terrifying things?
403000 [rattle]
40300c Whoa! [nervous laughter] It's just old pony armor. What's the big deal?
403008 Yeah! It's not like it's gonna come to life or anything. Right?
403000 [organ note]
403008 Huh?!
403000 [spinning]
403000 [growl]
40300c [screams]
403000 [organ chord]
40300d [yelps]
403000 [spinning]
40300e [screams]
403000 [organ chord]
403000 [carrot platform spins]
403000 [organ broken chord]
403008 Whoa-oa!
403000 [lightning and thunder]
403008 [screams]
40300d Oh! [screams]
403000 [more ominous organ music with strings]
403000 [crash of thunder]
40300d [groans, spits] Now, you look here, castle! You are very old and very scary! But your wall art is in an atrocious state!
403000 [wind whistling]
40300d And there is nothing you can do to keep me from my sacred task of restoration!
40300c Uh... Applejack? If you went back to Ponyville, that means I win, right?
403000 [rattle, crash]
40300c [screaming]
40300e [calling] Rarity! I know hiding isn't really your sense of humor, but please let this be a joke!
403000 [light tap]
403000 [loud organ chord]
40300e [panicked screaming, panting]
403000 [spinning]
403008 [screams] [echoing] Rainbow? Hello? I guess if I don't find you, I win by default, right?
40300d [grunts] [grumbles] Of all the castles in Equestria, this is by far the most ungrateful! Oof!
403000 [lightning]
40300e [whispered yelling] Angel! Rarity! Oh... I hope you two are together.
403000 [rock sliding]
403008 [yells]
40300c Haunted statues, creepy armor... Come on, castle! Is that all you got?
403000 [thunder]
403053 [scream]
40300c [scream]
40300e [scream]
403008 [scream]
40300d Aah! Aaaah! I was only trying to restore ancient art! [muffled crying]
403000 [lightning]
40300e [whimpering] [gasp] Angel?
403008 [grunting]
403000 [crash]
40300e AAANGEEEEEL!
403000 [distant thunder]
403003 What in the world is that?!
403005 Oh, you know. Probably just more strange sounds of this old castle falling apart!
403003 No one likes sarcasm, Spike.
403053 [yelling and screaming]
403005 What got into them?
40300e [grunting] It's okay, Angel! You're okay! You're okay!
403008 Yaaaaah! Shadows everywhere!
40300c [screaming]
40300d [crying]
40300e [sobbing] Aaangeeeeel!
403003 Alright, everypony, stop!
403008 Twilight?
40300e Must... save... Ange—! ...Oh.
40300c Fluttershy? What are you doing here?
40300d She's with me...
403000 [magic release]
40300d [gasps] Thank you.
403003 Have you all spent the whole night running around, scaring each other?
403008 Well, that depends.
403003 On what?
40300c On whether or not you're the Pony of Shadows.
403005 What's... the Pony of Shadows?
403003 Oh, that's just an old ponies' tale.
403000 [organ music]
403005 Then who's playing... that?
403003 We're going to find out.
403000 [ominous organ music continues]
403000 [all gasp]
403003 [whispered] The Pony of Shadows!
403000 [organ player continues]
403007 Hey, you guys! Did you know I can totally play the organ? Because I didn't!
40304d Pinkie?!
403007 Check it out!
403000 [plays sports "Charge!" theme]
40300c You're the Pony of Shadows?
403007 [continues playing light melody] The pony of what?
403003 See? What'd I tell ya?
403008 I thought you went to ring the school bell all week!
403007 Oh, yeah! I only had to ring it for, like, five minutes! They said that was good enough! Eh, can't imagine why...
403000 [bell ringing]
403007 So then, I decided to throw a "finish ringing the school bell" party! But I didn't have any bluebells, and you can't throw a "finish ringing the school bell" party without bluebells, so I went to Everfree Forest to pick some, but it started to get so chilly. [plays happy organ music] I had to wrap myself up in the tarp I was gonna use to gather flowers, and then I saw Fluttershy and Rarity. But they went into the castle before I could invite them to my party. Luckily, I followed them inside so I could help you all with your party! [stops playing]
40300d What party is that?
403007 Uh, the "everypony come to the scary old castle and hide from each other while I play the organ" party? [plays note]
403000 [sproing, thud]
403007 Duh!
40300d I swear, this is going right back where I found it just as soon as I've returned it to its former glory.
40300e Now don't go running off again! Oh, I can't believe I was so frightened. Guess I let my imagination get the best of me.
403008 I think we all did.
403007 I always let my imagination run away from me! Then it comes back... with cake!
403003 Well, it's good to know that whenever your imagination is getting away from you, a good friend can help you rein it in. And even though I didn't find anything out about the mysterious chest, I'm glad I was here to help all of you.
40300d You certainly did that, Twilight.
40300c Yeah! Why weren't you scared?
403003 Reading Celestia's diary made it hard to be afraid, because I knew what it was like when she and Luna lived here. Knowing something about the past made it easier to deal with my problems in the present, even the scary ones.
403025 [remarks of agreement]
403003 I've just thought of a great idea! Why don't we keep a journal, just like the royal pony sisters?
40300e All of us?
403003 Sure! That way we can learn from each other! And maybe some day, other ponies will read it and learn something, too!
40300d What a splendid idea!
403008 I know what my first entry will be! "Dear Diary, I'm glad Granny Smith's legend wasn't true."
40300c Me too!
403007 Me three! Because that means you two are still tied for "Most Daring Pony"!
403005 Heh, Shadow Ponies... How ridiculous is that?
403000 [credits]
40400c Four more months, four more months, four more months! I bet you're excited, huh?
40400e Oh, my. I, uh, I could be excited. I don't really know. I wasn't really think—
40400c Come on, you gotta be excited!
40400e Oh, well, I guess maybe I'm a little kinda sort of excited.
40400c I thought so!
40400e Yeah... so, um, why am I excited?
40400c Because the next Daring Do book is coming out exactly four months from today! That's how exciting it is! So what amazing, incredible, awesome adventure do you think Daring Do will have in her next book, huh?
40400c [voice over] Will she at long last stalk the Fortress of Talacon, only to be forced to contend with its dreaded and impenetrable arrow defense? And if so, could her skill, quick wits, and courage possibly carry the day? Or will her next adventure bring her face to face with the vast and horrible Ahuizotl himself?!
404151 [roars]
40400c Would she cower, turn tail and run? Or would she fly at him, full bore, knowing full well against all odds that the greatest challenge she ever faced was still surely no match for—
4041ff [gasps] Look out!
404000 [crash]
404000 [birds tweeting]
40400e Oh, I'm not so sure she's gonna last another four months...
404000 [theme song]
40400c Three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days, three months and twenty six days! Heya, Twilight! Aren't you excited that—
404007 [blows party horn]
404000 [party music playing]
404003 So glad you've finally made it!
40400c What's everypony doing here?
404007 We're having a holiday party! [blows horn]
40400c So what holiday would today be?
404007 National Random Holiday Party Day! Woo-hoo!
40400d I've never heard of it either. [sips] But the punch is quite tasty.
404007 You might say the secret ingredient is... [whispering loudly] a secret! [squee]
40400c How come nopony bothered to invite me?
404008 I came to invite you personally, but it seems you were a speck too busy reading the last Daring Do book for the twelfth time.
40400c Yeah, well, in three months and twenty six more days, I'll be able to read the next one.
404003 Oh, haven't you heard? The release of the next book got pushed another two months.
40400c [spit-take] Two more months?! I've been waiting so long already! I don't think I can take another two months! I'll never make it!
40400e Yeah. I can vouch for that...
40400c Did they give a reason?
404003 The publisher just said author A.K. Yearling won't be able to finish the book for another two months. Cupcakes?
40400c [growls] How could you possibly know that before me? I'm the series' biggest fan!
404003 I'm just as big a fan as you! In fact, I'm the one who first introduced you to the books, remember?
40400c Oh. Right.
404003 A.K. Yearling just might be my favorite author. I know everything about her. Where she grew up, where she studied literature, where she wrote the first Daring Do book...
40400c Where she lives?
404003 Uh... no, though I could probably find out somehow. Why?
40400c Don't you get it? The new book is obviously delayed because she needs help dealing with whatever everyday nonsense is distracting her from spending her every living breathing second writing so I— I mean, fans like me, can get to read the new book ASAP! Think about it! We could help her with her laundry, buy her groceries, cooking her meals, whatever! Now, who wouldn't appreciate that?
404003 Hmm, I don't know... what she probably wants most of all is respect for her privacy.
40400c She can always just say no.
404003 Mmh... I suppose you're right...
40400c Of course I am. So... how's about getting that address?
404003 You see what I mean? Why would she live in this remote part of Equestria except to keep folks from intruding on her privacy? We should respec—
40400c I think I spotted the house! We're super close! This way!
404003 Wait! Oh no. What happened?
40400c Apparently somepony has intruded on her privacy pretty hard already...
404000 [knocking]
404000 [crash]
404008 Hoo-wee, somepony really trashed this place.
404007 Hmm... maybe... or maybe A.K. Yearling's just a terrible, horrible, unbelievable slob!
40400d I hope A.K. Yearling's alright!
404003 Oh no! What if something terrible happened to her?
40400c I know! There might be no more books! Uh... but, of course, I'd be worried about her, too. Heh.
404200 What are you all doing here?
40400c Uh... A... K-K... Yearling...? [squee]
404003 We didn't do this! We swear!
404200 What have you done to my house?
404008 We didn't do this, Ms. Yearling— whoa!
404003 We're awfully glad to see you're alright.
40400c [whistles] Okay, clearly this isn't the best time, but I've just gotta say how much we all really love your books... [laughs nervously]
404000 [thud]
404000 [clicking]
404200 [sighs] It's safe.
40400c Great! Maybe now would be a good time for me to ask her how we can help move the new book along a little faster. Chop chop!
404003 Rainbow Dash, a minute please! A.K. Yearling has made it pretty clear that she wants to be left alone. We need to respect her wishes!
404007 You should tell that to those guys.
404201 [exclamations]
40401b A.K. Yearling is Daring Do!
404003 A.K. Yearling and Daring Do are one and the same! My mind is officially blown!
40400c Aw, come on, I knew it all along.
404000 [ring clanking]
404201 [exclamations]
404008 Amazing!
40400d Incredible!
404007 Wow! So much action! Whee!
40400c Daring Do!
404000 [grunting]
404000 [ring settling]
404202 Many thanks, Daring Do. As you've probably surmised, our earlier search for this treasure was... unsuccessful. So kind of you to find it for us.
40414e [grunting] Give it back, Caballeron!
404202 That's Doctor Caballeron to you.
40400c [hushed] He's from book four - Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams. He wanted to partner with Daring Do on her adventures.
404003 I know, but she refused! I can't believe it! The real Daring Do and the real Caballeron!
40414e So let me guess - Ahuizotl has put you up to this? You're stealing the ring to give to him so his hold on the Fortress of Talacon will be good for eight centuries as foretold by prophecy!
404202 Close, but... no. I'm going to sell this to him, make a bundle, and retire from archaeology in splendor.
40414e [grunting] Caballeron, you fool! You're dooming the valley to eight centuries of unrelenting heat!
404202 To market, henchponies!
40414e [grunting]
40400e Uh... should we go in and help her, maybe?
404015 Oh, right.
40400c [gasps] Are you okay?
40414e I got this.
40400e Um, she was just trying to help, Ms. Do.
40414e Daring Do doesn't need help. She handles her business herself.
40400c We've gotta go help!
404003 You heard her! She says she works alone!
40400c How can we just stand by and do nothing? You know what's at stake here! Ahuizotl has sought control of the Tenochtitlan Basin since book three!
404003 True, but in book four, she defeated Ahuizotl and secured control of the Amulet of Atonement, dispelling the dark magic of the Ketztwctl Empress, and thus protecting the basin with the Radiant Shield of Razdon!
40400c But the Radiant Shield of Razdon is vulnerable to the dark enchantment of the Rings of Scorchero!
404003 But are you forgetting that the Rings were scattered to the four corners of Tenochtitlan, thus rendering the dark enchantment powerless?
40400c Only if you assume that the Rings have yet to be retrieved, and the ring Caballeron just stole isn't the last to completely restore the dark tower and its cruel hold on Tenochtitlan! Did you ever think of that?!
404007 You gotta admit, Rainbow Dash makes a pretty good point.
40400c We gotta help Daring Do retrieve the ring for safekeeping before it's too late!
404003 [sighs] Okay, but sounds to me like we're in way, way, way over our heads. We're going to need a carefully thought out plan...
40400c I'm coming, Daring Do!
404003 That's not a plan!
40400c Come on, come on, come on... bingo! Here I come, Daring Do! To join an adventure with the greatest, bravest, coolest, most incredible hero I could ever– [whimpers] Okay, maybe I just need a sec... just another adventure. No big deal. [smack] Get a grip! I got this. Though, doing it alongside Daring Do... wow! Maybe I could get my picture taken with her, or an autograph– [smack] There you go again. She's just a pony like any other pony. A pony who stops entire armies of bad guys with nothing more than her bare hooves, and an attitude, and—! [smack] Ow... that's starting to hurt.
40414e [grunts]
40400c Yow! Stop!
40414e Oh, it's just you.
40400c Wait, don't go! [to herself] Think fast. This is your big chance to impress her with your quick wit and courage. [to Daring Do, nervously] I am suuuuuch a huge fan. [laughs nervously]
40414e [sighs]
40400c Wait, wait, wait! Let me help you! I promise I could be a huge, huge help if you just give me a chance.
40414e I. Work. Alone.
40400c But why won't you let me team up with you just this once?!
40414e My work always involves secrets. And since you never know who you can trust, it's best never to trust anypony.
40400c But just because you can't trust some, doesn't mean nopony can be trusted!
40414e Look, I don't have time to argue—
40400c Neither do I. Let's go!
40414e [sighs] [under her breath] Can't believe I'm even talking to her...
404000 [bushes rustling]
40400c Looks like they decided to have an early dinner before making their way back down the hill to the marketplace in town.
404000 [digging noise]
40400c Oh, I see. You're gonna ambush them like in book four at the Horavian caves! Or maybe, that neat trick you did in book three, where you swoop in and knock three guys down with one swing! Or maybe— [hushed] Okay. I'll be quiet now. Just watching very quietly, heh. Shh. So, what kind of ambush are you gonna use then?
404000 [bits jingling]
40400c Wow!
404000 [chewing noises]
404000 [bits jingling]
40414e [gravely voice] I have been led to believe you have in your possession an item of significant importance that might be... for sale.
404202 Oh, uh, well... I did have another buyer lined up, but he's not here, so... sounds like we have a deal.
404151 [roars] Caballeron!
40414e Ahuizotl!
404151 The ring!
404202 [gasps]
404000 [ring clanking]
404151 [roars]
40400c Be cool, Rainbow Dash, be cool... she's got this!
404151 The ring, Daring Do! Give it to me!
40414e Now, Ahuizotl, you know I love you, but I can't give you the ring 'til I've properly proposed.
404151 [laughs] Interesting, because my friends here have a proposal of their own. [fingers click]
404000 [big cats and kitten growling]
40414e Bring it!
404000 [big cats growling, punching noises, Daring Do grunting, etc.]
40400c Come on, Daring Do, come on...
404000 [Wilhelm scream]
40400c Daring Do! I've got your hat! You want me to toss it? Daring Do! Daring Do!
40414e [grunting]
40400c Whoa! [yelps]
404000 [cats yowling]
40414e [grunting]
40400c Don't worry, Daring Do! I'll come help you! Whoa! Ow.
404000 [thud]
40414e Don't bother! I'd say you've already helped plenty.
40400c What have I done?
40400d [gasps] Thank goodness you're alright!
404003 Quick, where does it hurt?
40400c In here. Daring Do and the ring have been captured by the dreaded Ahuizotl, and it's all my fault.
40411a [gasps]
404003 Dash, I'm sure whatever you did was an honest mistake.
40400c Whatever. Let's just go home.
404008 We can't go back now! Looks a mite like she needs our help more than ever!
40400c Trying to help is how I got in this mess in the first place. You were right, Twilight. We should've stayed out of this.
404003 Look, there is more going on here than meets the eye. In every Daring Do book, there always is! We can't turn our backs on her!
40400c She doesn't want my help, Twilight.
404003 Perhaps. But she might need it anyway.
40400c No. My hero's way better off without me.
404008 This don't sound like you.
404007 Where's the Rainbow Dash who would help anypony at the drop of a hat?
40400d Or pith helmet, as the case may be.
40400c She's here where she's got no business being. She should be at home.
404003 It's fine to look up to Daring Do, but you've put her so high up on a pedestal, you can't even see your own worth anymore! She's in the fortress, and we're here, and we wouldn't be who we are if we didn't go in after her! And neither would you! So, are you with us, or not?
404000 [underwater sounds]
40414e Surrender now, Ahuizotl, or I'll be forced to take you down! [grunts]
404151 [laughs] Oh, Daring Do, I will so miss your amusing laughter-jokes. Now, I must leave to commence the ring-placing ceremony to unleash eight hundred years of unrelenting, sweltering heat!
404000 [water thundering]
404151 [laughs]
40414e [sounds of exertion]
404000 [piranha jaws snapping]
40414e [sounds of exertion]
40400c Gotcha! [grunts] You can flap too, y'know!
404000 [crushing rocks]
40414e I was just about to save myself, y'know.
40400c Of course. I just thought you might need this.
40414e Have I mentioned yet that I work alone?
40400c Have I mentioned yet that you're lucky I don't?
40414e [sighs]
404000 [rhythmic thudding]
404151 [laughs]
404008 Drop the ring, Ahui... whatever your name is!
404151 Hmph, place the ring, quickly! Get it!
404000 [thuds, ring clanking, etc.]
40414e Come with me! Help me get all these rings off!
40400c [straining noises]
404000 [rings clinking]
40414e [panting] If we can remove the giant ring at the bottom, the whole fortress will collapse!
40400c W-Was this your plan all along?
40414e I had to find a way to get into the fortress.
40400c You did it on purpose?! But– but I thought—
40414e I didn't count on how heavy this ring would be, though... guess having a little help can be handy sometimes.
404151 [laughs]
404000 [rumbling]
404151 Stop her!
40414e [straining noises] You can flap too, y'know!
40400c [straining noises] Ponies! Run! This place is goin' down!
404000 [Wilhelm scream]
404000 [rumbling, crumbling]
404151 Daring Do! I will have my revenge!
404000 [shattering]
40414e Could never have done this without you, Rainbow Dash. I've got a book to finish!
40400c Just had the coolest adventure with the coolest pony ever. Came this close to blowing it because I got so wrapped up in how awesome she was, I almost forgot about how awesome I was. Good thing I didn't, 'cause it gave me a chance to show her how important it is to put your trust in somepony else.
404000 [knocking]
4041d4 Package from A.K. Yearling.
40400c Sweet! The new book a week before anypony else gets it! [gasps] Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh!
404000 [credits]
40505b Today, we have two special guests with a very special announcement! Everypony, welcome the head of the Equestria Games, Ms. Harshwhinny!
4051f7 Thank you. Now, I'm sure you all know about the Equestria Games, where ponies from all over the land compete for glory in various athletic pursuits. Well, now you littlest ones will have the chance to compete for a weighty responsibility of your very own.
40500c [distant] Oh, come on! Tell 'em the fun part!
405183 [Oohing and ahhing]
40500c That's right! All you gotta do is show Ms. Harshwhinny the coolest, most spectacular, most rocking routine and you're going to the Games! So who's going to be the lucky ponies?!
40505c It's gotta be me!
40510a Maybe it's me!
405065 Maybe it's us!
405039 Maybe it's us!
405000 [creaking]
405000 [thud]
405036 Hey! It could happen!
405000 [theme song]
40500c So, the winning team gets to carry the Ponyville flag at the Equestria Games! Oh, you are gonna love this!
4051f7 Ms. Dash, will you please curb your over-enthusiastic outbursts? Now then, let me be clear on the rules. You ponies will form teams. Each team will create their own flag carrying routine. Everypony will be judged on grace, style and originality. There's a most complicated scoring system, which I will elaborate upon now. Firstly—
40500c Aw, get to the nitty-gritty later. Tell 'em the important stuff! Like who's the coach! [blows whistle] That's right! Me! And you know why I'm qualified to coach you? Guess who carried the Cloudsdale flag in the Games when she was a little filly? Me! I'll never forget it—I burst into the stadium, spreading my wings, the flag flapping in the breeze. I did tricks with that flag the likes of which nopony saw before and nopony's seen since!
405000 [thud]
4051f7 Professionalism, Ms. Dash. I must insist. If you want to keep your job as coach of these ponies, you must maintain a professional attitude and keep your emotions in check! Am I making myself absolutely, one hundred percent crystal clear?
40500c Yes, Ms. Harshwhinny. Y'know, "professionalism" is my middle name. Rainbow Professionalism Dash.
4051f7 Hmph! Well, in three days time, Ms. Dash will accompany anypony competing to the Crystal Empire, where you will demonstrate your routines for me and the other judges, who will judge you very professionally.
40500c Ahem. Yes. Quite, quite correct. In the meantime, get ready to train, and train hard, because I know this opening ceremony is the single most important thing that will ever happen in your young lives! But, I know you're up for the challenge. And so am I! Wooho—! Ahem... meet me after school tomorrow at 1500 hours. Sharp. And show me your flag carrying skills. I am outta here. Professionally. See how professionally?
4051f7 Ugh. Ponies, the most important thing is this - Your routine needs to show what your town means to you. So, do Ponyville proud. Work hard, be bold, wow me. That is all!
405000 [school bell rings]
405000 [foals talking]
405065 So what do you say we come up with the perfect routine and win this thing?
40500a I'd say that's rootin'-tootin' terrific!
405066 But there's one problem! I bet everypony in class is planning to compete!
405065 Listen. Somepony in our class is gonna carry that flag, so it might as well be us! Crusaders, are you in or are you in? 'Cause I'm in!
40500a Me too!
405000 [beat]
405066 Me three!
405065 Alright, the winning routine needs to show what's important about Ponyville, right?
405081 Right!
405065 So... what's special about Ponyville? It's... it's... I got it! It's a place where different kinds of ponies live together as friends!
40500a Earth ponies like me!
405066 Unicorns like me!
405065 And Pegasi like me! So somehow we got to figure out a way to show that in our act.
405066 We're gonna need a plan.
40500a And a lot of hard work!
405065 And a whole bunch of practice! But take it from me; we may just be little ponies, but we have hearts as strong as horses!
405000 [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle]
405000 We're the toughest little ponies in town
405000 Got the moves, got the mojo, no harder working ponies around
405000 We are a trio, work as a team
405000 We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene
405000 We get going when the going gets tough
405000 We know our very best is just never enough
405000 We're kinda short, but so what? We don't get defeated
405000 We could take a little break, but we don't need it
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses
405000 When we put our minds together, we can achieve
405000 We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and you should believe
405000 We've got determination to represent the nation
405000 For the win
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory
405000 We can conquer any challenge we're in
405000 We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses
405000 Hearts strong as horses
405080 Whoa!
405000 [thud]
405080 Oof!
405000 [clapping]
40505c If that's the best you've got, we're going to win for sure.
40505f We already have the most divine routine planned.
40505c It's absolutely sure to crush everyone else – and I mean crush.
405065 But we're winners! And we have [starts singing] hearts—
40505f Sure. But you know what you don't have?
405060 Your cutie marks! Blank flanks, blank flanks, blank flanks!
40500a What does that have to do with flag carryin'?
40505f Having cutie mark-less ponies represent Ponyville would be unthinkable.
40505c And we, of course, already have our cutie marks. So we know who's gonna be in the winner's circle.
405065 Listen, you two! Cutie marks or no cutie marks, you'll see! The Crusaders are gonna carry that flag at the Games.
40505f May the best ponies win!
405065 Game on!
40500c Show me what you got, Cutie Mark Crusaders, and make it good!
405065 Don't worry, we will!
405066 Now, this is just a little something we threw together. It's not perfect yet, not even close.
40505c Let's watch the Cutie Mark "Goof-saders" do their saddle routine.
40505f They're gonna be a hot mess!
405060 [giggling]
405065 Since the dawn of recorded time, in one town of amazing amazingness, three types of ponies coexist!
40500a We are Earth ponies!
405066 We are unicorns!
405065 We are Pegasi! And the town where friendship reigns is our home. Now, welcome to the stadium, the flag of the place we love best...
405080 Ponyville forever! Yay!
405065 It's kind of a work in progress. So? What did you think?
40500c That was ama— [thinking] Wait. Hold on now. Gotta stay calm, cool and collected. [aloud] To give a calm, clear analysis— wait. You whipped that act together just yesterday?! That is— [thinking] Professionalism, Dash, keep those emotions in check! [aloud] Overall, it was... kinda, sorta... [quickly] overall, it was okay. Keep working hard. Who knows? You might have a shot. Gotta go!
40500a Do y'all think she liked it?
405066 I'm not really sure.
405065 You heard her! If we keep working hard, we might have a shot! So let's keep working! Trot to it, ponies!
40505c Did you see that?! I can't believe I'm saying this. They could win!
40505f But how do we stop them? We already called them blank flanks!
40505c Then we need to find a new way to get under their skin. Or maybe... get under their wings.
40505c Girls, we just wanted to say your act is quite impressive!
405066 Wait... what?
40500a Um... thanks?
40505f Oh, but of course. As a matter of fact, we think you're very brave.
405065 Brave? Why?
40505c Isn't it obvious? It is to us. In fact, it's obvious to everypony. You're showing all three types of Ponyville ponies, yet you have a Pegasus pony...
405060 ...who can't even fly!
40500a What in tarnation does that have to do with anything?
40505f I'd say not even being able to fly has everything to do with everything. Doesn't it?
40505c I mean, a Pegasus pony at your age? You should've been flying long ago.
405065 So what if my wings can't get me off the ground?
40505c Your career as a flag carrier isn't getting off the ground either.
40505f Ms. Harshwhinny will never pick a Pegasus pony who can't fly to represent Ponyville in front of all of Equestria.
405066 Ms. Harshwhinny never said anything about that!
40505f I would've thought that was obvious.
40505c Well, have fun practicing anyway, even if your routine will never—how shall I say—take off!
405066 Don't listen to them, Scootaloo. Scootaloo? You okay?
405065 This routine isn't working how it is. We've gotta rethink my part in the whole thing.
405066 What?
40500a Why?
405065 If we wanna win, I'm gonna have to fly!
405066 Is that even possible?
40500a And by tomorrow?
405065 Maybe I can win if I work twice as hard. See? Oof! Maybe... three times as hard.
40500a Golly, I don't know, Scootaloo, I don't think that's the problem.
405065 Well, I know this for sure – flying is the only way we're gonna win, so it's back to practice!
405066 Is this a good idea?
405065 Whoaaaaa!
405000 [thud]
405065 I'll just work four times as hard!
40500a Probably not.
405065 [sighs] Guys, guys, guys! Try it again!
40500a [yawns] But we've been rehearsin' all the livelong day! We're gettin' tired!
405065 Fine! We'll skip to my big impressive flying entrance. So you've done the do-si-do to the left, then to the right, and then there's the hoop. Then I come in—
405000 [thud]
405065 Not quite what I had in mind. We'll just... try that part again. [straining noises]
40500a [hushed] I liked the routine the way it was!
405066 [hushed] Me too! But all she cares about now is flying!
405065 Don't worry, I'll be flying high tomorrow on our final run-through for Rainbow Dash. I'm gonna get this, you'll see. [straining noises]
405000 [thud]
40500c Okay, Cutie Mark Crusaders, this is your final run before you show it at the stadium tomorrow. I know you're gonna absolutely, positively— have a lot of fun, heheh. Okay, go! [blows whistle]
405065 [panting] Ponyville! Home of the, um...
405081 [hushed] Friendship!
405065 Ah, friendship, right! Uh, there are four— no, three kinds of ponies.
40500a [yawns]
405066 [hushed] Left, left!
40500a [hushed] I'm sorry! I'm just tired! And then I dip, and then we turn, and— Sorry!
405081 [straining noises]
405000 [boing]
405000 [thud]
405065 Ta-da! Oof! [panting] So? What'cha think?
40500c That's... y'know... good and all, heheh... I just thought... maybe possibly you might wanna go back to, say, the first version of the act, which was, I dunno, what's the word, better? Just do the routine as it was! Don't mess with success, right? Seriously. Now I need to... go coach these other ponies! And don't forget, we've got to catch the early train for the Crystal Empire. See you in the morning!
405065 What are we gonna do?! We're competing tomorrow, and I still can't fly! Unless...
405066 I'm just too tired! I can't keep going!
40500a Me too! I'm tired, I'm hungry, and now I hate this routine! It feels like it's all about you now!
405066 She's right. It's like you don't even need us anymore!
405065 Of course I need you! Without you two, who's gonna hold up the hoop?
40500a Rrgh! You don't listen to yourself! Forget it. I'm goin' home to get some sleep.
405065 So? Are you gonna leave me too?
405066 We've gotta catch the early train to the Crystal Empire. I'd better get some rest. See you in the morning, Scootaloo.
405065 Come on, Scootaloo! Do it for Ponyville! Just got to try twenty times as hard! [straining noises] Thirty times as hard...! Oof! Just... a little... harder!
405000 [thud]
405065 [straining noises] [sighs] I can't fly. I just... can't.
405203 Crystal Empire! All aboard!
405066 Scootaloo? Where is she?
40500a She'd better get here soon! This here train is about to leave!
405065 Here I am...
40500a We were scared you were gonna miss the train!
405065 I... I'm not going.
405081 What?!
405065 I'm the weak link. If I go, and fall, flop, or do anything but fly, I'm gonna blow it for you two.
405066 I can't believe you're quitting on us!
405065 But you're better off without me!
405066 But that's not true, Scootaloo!
40500a You know what, Sweetie Belle? Forget it. If she's gonna quit, we don't want her, and we don't need her!
405065 Fine!
40500a Fine!
405066 Fine...
405203 All aboard!
405000 [train puffing]
405000 [train whistle blowing]
40500c How's my favorite routine going today? Oh, I just can't keep it in! I want you to win so bad! [to the BGM] Bom, bom, bom, bom... and then Scootaloo does that [half-whistles] through the hoop!
40500a Well, there ain't gonna be a Scootaloo.
405066 She's staying home.
40500c She's what?!
40500a She got it in her head that the only way to represent Ponyville was by flyin' in our routine! When she couldn't do it, she told us that she was quittin'.
40500c And then you tried to stop her from doing that, right?
405066 Well, actually, we kinda told her...
40500a ...uh, that we didn't want a quitter.
40500c Hang on. Are you nuts?! You're a team, and a team never leaves a friend behind!
405000 [ding]
405000 [brakes squealing]
40500c Come on!
40505c Sorry you can't make it! We'll take a picture for you from the winner's circle!
405060 [laughing, under]
405066 I do not like them one bit.
40500c Put on some speed, girls!
405000 [ripping noises]
405000 [clang]
40500c Throwing away your scooter?!
405065 Rainbow Dash?
40500c Yup, but not just me.
405065 I don't wanna see them. And what are they doing here, anyway? They're supposed to be on the train.
40500a We're not goin'.
405066 Not without you, Scootaloo.
40500c What's gotten into you, Scootaloo?
405065 I didn't want to ruin their chance to win just because I couldn't fly.
40500c And who said you had to?
405065 But flying's what Pegasus ponies are supposed to do! You flew when you carried the flag in the games!
40500c But that was me! You're you! And it just doesn't matter if you can fly or not. Your routine was amazing 'cause it represented exactly what makes Ponyville special. You do still know what that is, right?
405066 Friendship.
40500a Three kinds of ponies livin' together as friends. Just like us. Earth ponies...
405066 ...unicorns...
405065 ...and Pegasi. But Rainbow Dash... what if... what if my wings never grow? What if I never fly?
40500c Listen, Scootaloo. Maybe you'll fly someday, or maybe you won't. You're all kinds of awesome anyway. Who's the toughest little pony in town?
405066 [Sweetie Belle]
405066 Got the moves, got the mojo...
40500a [Apple Bloom]
40500a No harder working pony around.
405065 [Scootaloo]
405065 We are a trio, work as a team
405000 [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle]
405000 We'll be the first ponies out on the flag-waving scene
405065 So let's get to the Crystal Empire and let's do the routine as it was! And let's win this thing!
405000 [Apple Bloom, Scootaloo, and Sweetie Belle]
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 We've got hearts as strong as horses
405000 And we're playing to win as we gallop to glory
405000 We can conquer any challenge we're in
405000 We've got hea-a-a-arts, hearts strong as horses
405000 Hearts strong as horses
405000 [crowd cheering]
405080 Ponyville forever! Yay!
405000 [microphone feedback]
4051f7 [through microphone] In the Equestria Games, the Ponyville flag will be carried by... 'Cutie Mark Crusaders'!
405000 [crowd cheering]
405060 [groaning]
40500c Ahem. Look. What you three did was... acceptable.
4051f7 Acceptable? Acceptable?! Why, it was totally stupendously the single most amazing thing I've ever seen! [laughs]
40500c Contain your excitement, Ms. Harshwhinny. Remember – professionalism.
4051f7 Ahem. Y-Yes, well, I- [laughs nervously]
405204 [laughing]
405065 You know what this means, right?
40500a What?
405065 We are totally gonna get cutie marks in flag-carrying!
405081 Yeah!
405080 [laughing]
405000 [credits]
406000 [pages flipping]
406003 Spike, you really need to go to sleep!
406005 Aw, two more minutes, Twilight! I'm just getting to the really good part! The Mane-iac is about to—
406003 "The Mane-iac"?
406005 The Power Ponies' most evil nemesis! She was the power-mad owner of a hair-care product company. A tragic accident at her shampoo factory in Maretropolis not only gave her mane strange new powers but also caused her to go completely insane! She and her henchponies are planning to break into the Maretropolis Museum and steal the Electro-Orb so she can use it to power up her doomsday device! Of course, the Mane-iac wouldn't have even known if Hum Drum hadn't slipped up and told her all about it.
406003 Hum Drum?
406005 Nah, the guy in the blue boots and pointless red cape. The Power Ponies' bumbling and totally useless sidekick. The Power Ponies have to stop the Mane-iac or Maretropolis is doo-hoo-hoo-hoomed!
406003 Believe me, Spike. If anypony understands what it's like to get caught up in a really good book, it's me. But if we're going to make any progress fixing up Luna and Celestia's old castle tomorrow, we all have to do our part. We don't want to be too tired to lend a hoof... or claw.
406005 Okay, okay, I'm going to bed. Goodnight.
406000 [click]
406000 [patting]
406003 Two more minutes.
406005 Yes!
406000 [theme song]
406003 Looking good, everypony! Let's keep this magical makeover moving!
40600c You got it!
406005 Good old Spike is here, ready to do his part!
406007 A little more to the left! No, the other left! [quickly] Awesome! That's perfect right where it is! On to the next painting!
406005 You sure you don't need any help?
406008 Nah, that's okay.
406007 [quickly] We have everything under control!
406005 Dash?
40600c I'm good!
406005 [sighs] Isn't there anything I can help you with, Twilight?
406007 [quickly] Don't worry about it, Spike! It's all good!
406003 I think she's right. It looks like we've got it, Spike. Looking great, everypony! Why don't you find a quiet spot and finish reading your comic? Aren't you right at the part where Hum Drum was about to stop the villain?
406005 Hum Drum never stops the villain. He's just there for comic relief. [splash and clatter] [grunts]
406003 Rarity, lemme give you a hoof with that!
406005 I could do it!
406003 That's okay, Spike.
406007 Pony power! Weehee!!
406005 [sigh]
406000 [bucket clatters]
406005 [to himself] Mane-iac breaks into the museum... okay, here we go. ...Ugh, what a surprise! Hum Drum is in the way again while the Power Ponies do all the work! I guess I know what that feels like... [gasps] Wait. What? How can that be the end?! What's... that? "You can... retr-" What? "You can... return..." Urgh! I know I saw a magnifying glass laying around the last time I was here...
406008 Spike! Where are ya, Spike?
40600d We're breaking for tea and biscuits!
40600c Spike!
406005 [reading] "You can return to the place you started when the Mane-iac is... defeated." Huh? "Take a closer look to join the adventure in this book"? What does that even mean? Whoa! Cool!
406003 Spike! What are you—
406005 Heeeeeelp!
406003 Spike! [straining noises]
40600c [straining noises]
406008 [straining noises]
40607e [gasps] [screaming]
406007 Weehee!
406005 Is this... Maretropolis?
406008 Somepony wanna tell me what the hay is goin' on?
406005 Holy new personas, ponies! You're the... Masked Matter-Horn! Fili-Second! Zapp! R-Radiance! Mistress Mare-velous! Saddle Rager! You're the... Power Ponies!
406000 [thud]
406000 [whipping noises]
406205 Power Ponies! [laughs] How kind of you to join us!
406012 Huh?
406205 [evil laughter]
406205 [evil laughter]
406008 Did she just call us... Power Ponies?
406005 You're the... the superheroes from my comic book! It somehow zapped us all in here!
40600c So somepony zap us back out!
406005 My comic book! It said the way to get back to where we started was to defeat the Mane-iac! Your arch-nemesis!
406205 Time for the mane event!
406000 [crash]
40600c Pinkie! Where'd she go?!
406007 Wheeeeeeee!
406005 She could be miles away from here by now! Pinkie is Fili-Second, the fastest pony in all of Maretropolis!
406000 [whipping noise]
406000 [clang]
406008 Whoa! [straining noises]
406205 [cackles]
406005 Twilight! Freeze her mane!
406003 Do what?
406005 You're the Masked Matter-Horn! You can shoot all kinds of crazy power beams from your horn!
406000 [magic fizzling out]
406205 You know, I'm beginning to enjoy this. [cackles]
406012 [gasps]
406000 [thud]
406005 Dash! Quick! You're Zapp, and your superpower is controlling the mighty forces of nature! Unholster the lightning bolt!
406000 [electricity crackling]
406000 [lightning cracking]
406005 Lightning, not a tornado!
406007 [yelps]
406012 [yelping]
406007 Whoa!
40600c Whoa-whoa!
406012 [screaming]
406005 Fluttershy! You're Saddle Rager! Lose your temper, and you'll turn into a huge, super-strong monster!
40600e Oh, gosh! That wouldn't... be very... polite!
406005 Ugh! Rarity! Use your jewelry to create attack constructs!
40600d What's an attack construct?!
406005 Just think of something, anything, and your bracelet makes it appear!
406000 [smashing crockery]
406005 Something useful!
406000 [thud]
406005 The Electro-Orb!
406205 Well, this has been quite the mane-raising experience. But I really must be going. [laughs]
406000 [thud]
406205 Why, thank you, Hum Drum! [evil laughter]
406000 [whipping noises]
406005 I'm Hum Drum...?! Oh no... [straining noises] Applejack! You gotta... help stop the... tornado from destroying.. the city!
406008 But every time I move, this darn lasso gets tighter!
406005 You're psychically connected to it! Will it to where you want it to go, and it'll obey you!
406000 [lasso whipping]
406000 [thud]
406007 [giggles] That was spin-tastic!
406008 Lemme get this straight - We've been sucked into some kind of comic-book world?
406005 Technically, it's called Maretropolis. And if we wanna get back to Ponyville, I think we have to stop the Mane-iac from using her doomsday device to destroy it!
40600c No biggie. I was already awesome. And now we've all got superpowers!
406005 Almost all of us have superpowers...
40600d But you must have them too, Spikey-boo. Your character is wearing a cape!
406005 Yeah, for absolutely no reason. He's pretty much useless...
406003 Good thing you're not really Hum Drum, then.
406005 Yeah, good thing...
40600c So the six of us Power Ponies will take care of Mane-iac, and get us back to Ponyville!
406003 Spike, where is the Mane-iac building her doomsday device?
406005 Her top-secret headquarters! But you'd better get there quick. That glowing orb she just stole is what she's going to use to power it up!
406008 Lead the way, Spike!
40600c Then leave the rest to us!
406005 [sighs]
406000 [neon light humming]
406005 There it is!
406008 Is that a... shampoo factory?
406003 All right, Power Ponies, here's the plan. Rarity, you, me and—
40600c Come on out, Mane-iac! Or the Power Ponies are comin' in!
406000 [thunder crash]
406003 So much for "element of surprise".
406005 Guess I'll just hang back here doing nothing.
406000 [electricity crackling]
40600e Oh, I don't think she's home. Maybe we should just come back later.
406205 [evil laughter]
40600d She's home.
406000 [garage door opening]
406008 Time to Power Pony up!
406007 Ooh! Nice catchphrase!
406003 Freeze ray!
406000 [thwap]
40600d It's an improvement, darling.
406000 [thud]
406007 [giggles]
406000 [banging]
406000 [crash]
40600d Ooh, I do so love a functional accessory!
40600e [whimpering]
406000 [lightning strikes]
406206 My hair!
40600c Seriously? You aren't even just a little angry right now?
406003 Nice work, Power Ponies! Now let's take care of the Mane-iac and get ourselves home!
406205 I don't think so! I have a city to destroy, and I'm not about to let the Power Ponies stop me! Not this time!
40600c Just watch us!
406005 The Hairspray Ray of Doom! It stops you in your tracks and renders your powers useless!
406000 [hairspray hissing]
406000 [clunk]
40600d We'll just see about that!
406000 [hairspray hissing]
406000 [ice cracking]
406000 [tink]
406205 [evil laughter]
406005 Fluttershy, please! Just a little anger?!
40600e Well, I'm not so much angry as I am concerned, bordering on terrified!
406000 [hairspray hissing]
406005 Don't spray!
406205 [cackles] Oh, Hum Drum, why in all of Maretropolis would I use the Hairspray Ray of Doom on you? Rather pointless, don't you think?
406012 [shouts of concern]
406000 [door slamming]
406000 [clang]
406005 What am I supposed to do? I'm useless. No wonder my friends never need me to do anything important. They're the ones with superpowers. They've probably already figured out how to escape.
406000 [clang]
406005 Or not!
406000 [cracking]
406000 [timer ringing]
406000 [hairspray hissing]
406000 [cracking]
406205 Congratulations, Power Ponies! [laughs] You shall live just long enough to see me fire... the instrument of your destruction! [cackles] Once the Electro-Orb has powered it up completely, this cannon will amplify the power of my mane one million times, expelling an energy blast that will cause everypony in Maretropolis's mane to grow wild! [laughs] You will be my weapon's first victims, and there is nopony who can save you from this fate! [evil laughter]
40600e Ahem. I don't mean to interrupt, but aren't you forgetting about somepony?
406205 Hum Drum? Little guy? No superpowers whatsoever? [laughs] He's utterly useless!
406000 [timer ringing]
406000 [hairspray hissing]
406205 Puh-lease. Everypony knows you just keep him around because you [condescending tone] feel sowwy for him. Wah. Wah.
406003 Maybe in your world. But in our world, Spike— uh, Hum Drum always comes through when we need him! Always!
406025 [agreements]
406005 I'm not like Hum Drum! When my friends really need me, I do come through! And they need me now!
406205 [laughs] I see dementia must be a side-effect of prolonged exposure to the Hairspray Ray of Doom. [laughs] Tonight, we stand upon the brink of immortality, for we collectively—though, mostly me—have finally defeated our most hated nemeses! We have hurled the brush of badness into the now fearful face of [laughs] goodness, and have struck a blow for freedom in the name of oppression! And nothing will stop us! [laughs]
406000 [chain rattling]
406201 [yelping]
406000 [whinny]
406000 [timer ringing]
406000 [chain rattling]
406000 [thwack]
406000 [hairspray hissing]
406003 Way to go, Spike!
406000 [cracking]
406000 [clang]
40600c Get mad!
40600e I'm trying! [straining noises]
406007 Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it! Tag you're it!
406205 Over there! There! There! Idiots!
406000 [ice cracking]
406000 [thud]
406000 [electricity crackling]
406000 [lightning crackling]
40600c Need a place to put these guys!
406000 [clanging]
406000 [thudding]
406008 Hold it right there, partner!
406000 [zapping]
406201 [screaming]
406000 [Wilhelm scream]
406005 Fluttershy, where are you going?
40600e You seem to have everything under control.
406005 Fluttershy, we need you! You have to power up!
40600e I'm sorry, it's just that nothing is making me mad.
406000 [firefly buzzing]
406000 [smack]
406000 [firefly squealing]
40600e Oh, goodness! Are you okay? [to the Mane-iac] Are you kidding me? I mean, I know you're evil and everything, but [getting frustrated] you hurt a teensy, little, harmless firefly?! Really?! Well you're just a great big meanie! [voice getting deeper] There! I said it! What makes you think you're so special?! Like the rules of common courtesy don't apply to you?! [voice getting even deeper] Why don't you pick on somepony your own size?! [roars]
406000 [controls buzzing]
406000 [laser firing]
40600e [roars]
406205 [yelps]
40600e [roaring]
406000 [smashing noises]
40600e [spits]
406205 My mane! [laughs] My maaaaaane! [laughs insanely]
406000 [thud]
406000 [electricity crackling]
406005 Once again, the day is saved by—
406012 [yelping]
406000 [thud]
40600c Awesome!
406008 Whoo-ee!
406012 [excited chattering]
40600c Did you see how I was raining down a storm of justice at the end there?!
406008 You catch how I was wieldin' that lasso?
406007 Cupcakes?
40600d How did you—
406007 Eh, we had a good half second before we got sucked back out of the comic, and the Maretropolis bakery was only sixty-five blocks away!
406005 I'm just glad to be back.
406003 We wouldn't have made it without you, Spike. And I hope you realize that just because we don't always need your help, it doesn't mean that we don't think you're helpful.
406005 And that you don't have to have superpowers to be a super friend.
406012 [general agreement]
406003 But I do have one question. Where exactly did you get that comic book?
406005 This one I got in Canterlot at the House of Enchanted Comics. Well, I didn't know it meant they were literally enchanted!
406012 ["Aw, come on!", overlapping disbelief]
406005 I thought it just meant, like, the comics they sold there had really enchanting storylines! Hey, wait up! I'm an important part of this team, remember?!
406000 [magic zapping]
406000 [credits]
407008 Any minute now...
407000 [rooster crowing]
407008 Yee-haw! It's officially Apple Bucking Day! Look at all those apples! Ripe and juicy, perfect for buckin'! [grunts]
407000 [splat]
407008 What the heck is goin' on? [gasps] They're back!
407000 [bats chittering]
407000 [theme song]
407000 [bell ringing]
407008 Attention! This is a Sweet Apple Acres code red! I need all hooves – and claws – on deck!
40700d Calm down, Applejack.
407008 Calm down?! How can I calm down at a time like this?! Vampire fruit bats are attackin' Sweet Apple Acres!
407003 But I thought the fruit bats usually stayed put in the west orchard.
407008 The fruit bats do, but these aren't just your everyday ordinary fruit bats. They're vampire fruit bats! I'll be darned if they think they're gonna sink their fangs into my blue ribbon apple.
407024 [Wow, etc.]
407005 Awesome!
407008 This here's our entry into the Appleloosa State Fair's produce competition. [exhales] You know how much TLC goes into getting an apple to grow like this?
40700d Applejack! When you go big, you really go big!
407008 Them vampire bats want to shrivel it up like a raisin!
40700e Oh, I'm sure if we just let them know how special that particular apple is to you, they'll leave it alone.
407008 Yeah, right. Be my guest.
407000 [bats chittering quietly]
40700e Um, excuse me, Mr Vampire Bat—
407000 [splat]
40700e We were just wondering if maybe you wouldn't mind leaving that really big apple alone?
407000 [seeds hammering]
40700e [gasps]
407008 Well? What'd he say?
40700e Um... yes.
407008 Huh?!
40700e But... it could've been a no.
407008 Oh.
40700e This is the first vampire fruit bat I've ever met and, well, it might take some time for me to really understand their language.
407008 Uh-huh. And in the meantime, this pest and his vermin friends are gonna go after my prized apple and, while they're at it, every other apple in the orchard! These vampire bats are nothin' but a bunch of monsters!
40700e Monsters?! Oh, that's a bit harsh, don't you think?
407008 No, I do not.
407008 [Applejack]
407008 Those vampire bats will give you a fright
407008 Eating apples both day and night
407008 They rest for a minute, maybe three
407008 Then they're eatin' every apple in your apple tree
407008 They don't care about nada, not zilch, no, nothin'
407008 'Cept bringin' about an orchard's destruction
40700e [Fluttershy]
40700e Now wait just a minute, there's another side to this
40700e And if I did not defend them, then I would be remiss
40700e These bats are mamas and papas too
40700e They care for their young just like we ponies do
407008 [Applejack]
407008 Oh, give me a break, you're bein' too kind
407008 These creatures have a one-track mind
407008 The orchard is not their restaurant
407008 But do they ever think what others may want?
407008 No! They don't! And that is just a fact
407008 These bats, they simply don't know how to act
40700e [Fluttershy]
40700e That's where I have to disagree
40700e They're loyal to their family
40700e Spreading seeds both far and wide
407008 [Applejack]
407008 You see one comin', you'd better run and hide!
407008 They're big and ugly and mean as sin
407008 Will ya look at the state my trees are in?
40700e [Fluttershy]
40700e They help your trees, they'll grow stronger faster
407008 [Applejack]
407008 They've turned my life to a total disaster!
40700d [Rarity]
40700d Well, I for one don't have a doubt
40700d These vermin must be stamped right out
40700c [Rainbow Dash]
40700c I second that, they've got to go
40700c These bats, they've got to hit the road
407008 [Applejack]
407008 It comes down to just one simple fact
407008 They've crossed the line, it's time to fight them back!
407000 [All except Fluttershy]
407000 Stop the bats! Stop the bats!
407000 Make them go and not come back!
407000 Stop the bats! Stop the bats!
407000 Make them go and not come back!
407000 Stop the bats! Stop the bats!
407000 Make them go and not come back!
407008 [Applejack]
407008 Yes, it comes down to just one simple fact
407008 They've crossed the line, it's time that we attack!
40700d I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I believe Applejack has made the better argument. These vampire fruit bats sound downright dreadful.
407008 So let's get to roundin' them up so they don't destroy the rest of my orchard.
407007 [to the tune of Winter Wrap Up] Fruit bat round-up, fruit bat round-up!
40700e Um, excuse me, but, um, what if instead of rounding them up, we... let them have part of the orchard?
407008 [whinny] Have you lost your pest-lovin' mind?!
40700e They're only here because they're hungry! If we build a sanctuary for them, they could have their own apples to enjoy! After a while, they could even help the rest of your orchard! The vampire bats don't eat the seeds of the apples, and when they spit them out, they grow into even more productive apple trees!
407008 Listen, Fluttershy. That sounds real nice 'n' all, but every second we spend buildin' this so-called 'sanctuary' is a second they'll spend destroyin' orchards! You don't know what it was like the last time there was an infestation, but Granny Smith has told me enough stories about it that just the thought of it gives me nightmares! [narrating] Granny says we lost a huge section of orchard that year. They had to ration out apples all winter!
40700c What about the cider? There was still cider, right?
407008 Not... a... drop.
40700c No cider?! No cider?! We need to round up these monsters, and we need to do it now!
407008 If Granny Smith wasn't with Apple Bloom an' Big Mac checkin' out our produce competition in Appleloosa, she'd be here tellin' us to do just that!
407003 I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I think Applejack is right. I just wish there was another way we could convince them not to eat them in the first place. Maybe there is...!
407003 So, there's good news and bad news. The good news is that I found a spell that can get the vampire fruit bats to stop wanting to suck the juice from the apples. But in order for the spell to work, I need the bats' full and complete attention.
40700e [gasps] Oh no.
407003 Fluttershy, I need you to do your Stare on the bats.
40700e Oh, gosh, I don't know.
40700c What's the problem? You've used the Stare plenty of times before!
40700e Yes, but it's not something I take lightly. I've made a vow not to use it except in dire circumstances.
407008 This circumstance is plenty dire to me!
40700c Me too! Think of the cider! Won't somepony please think of the cider?!
40700e I'm sorry. I just don't like the idea of taking away the thing that really makes the vampire fruit bats [inhales] vampire fruit bats! It just feels wrong!
407003 But if we don't do this, there won't be any apples left for anypony here in Ponyville. Doesn't that feel wrong, too?
407008 So what's it gonna be, Fluttershy? Will you do your Stare on the bats or not?
40700e Um... Um... Okay, I'll do it.
40700d Good choice. I knew you wouldn't side with those icky bats! [whimpers]
40700e They're not icky.
40700c First round of cider's on me!
407008 Hold it right there! We've gotta round up these beasts with wings first. Time's a-wastin'!
407000 [bats chittering]
40700d [muffled] [yelps] Ew, ew, ew, ewwww!
407000 [bat gulps and spits]
40700c Gotcha!
407007 [giggles]
40700d [screams]
407008 Good work, everypony! I think we got 'em all! [to Fluttershy] Now all we need is for you to do your Stare.
40700e Oh, um, are you sure I really need— Okay. I really, really, really hate to do this to you... I just hope you can forgive me...
407000 [bats hissing]
407008 Good... Now you go, Twilight!
407003 Alright.
407000 [magic humming]
407003 You can stop staring, Fluttershy.
407005 Did it work?
407008 Only one way to find out for sure.
407000 [bat sniffing, chittering]
40700c Ye-he-heah, whoo!
407008 My crop is saved! Yee-haw!
40700c We'll be drinking cider all winter long!
407008 I wanna thank you for your help. I couldn't have done it without you.
407005 Aw, don't mention it, Applejack. It was my pleasure! Really!
407008 Now all we gotta do is sweep up these cores so I can start buckin' fresh tomorrow mornin'!
40700e [sniffs]
407008 Apple Bucking Day, take two!
407000 [rooster crowing]
407008 Yee-haw! Time to collect those juicy, sweet apples! [grunts]
407000 [splat]
407003 The spell didn't work!
407008 You're darn tootin' the spell didn't work! I think we're gonna have to take more extreme measures!
40700c I hear ya, Applejack! C'mon, everypony! Let's track down those vampire bats!
407000 [bats chittering]
407000 [splat]
407008 Wait a minute... I don't think these bats are the ones that sucked my apples dry.
40700d But if the vampire bats aren't eating your apples...
407003 Who is? Fluttershy, you're our animal expert. Do you know of any other creature that might be capable of this?
40700e I'm sorry. I don't.
407003 Well, there's only one way to find out. We'll have to catch whoever it is in the act.
40700d And how do you propose we do that?
407003 A stakeout...!
40700c [spookily] The witching hour...
407000 [owl hoots]
40700e Maybe we should just call this off. Not sure about the rest of you guys, [entranced] but I'm really hungry... [drip, drip, gulp]
40700d Oh, Fluttershy, it'll be okay. Don't forget, darling, we're all in this together.
407003 That's right. Nopony leaves this orchard until we've solved this mystery. Agreed?
407025 Agreed!
407008 Does everypony have their pony signals? Now remember, Pinkie Pie, only use the signal if you see somethin' suspicious.
407007 I got it. Something suspicious...
40700e [sniffing]
407007 Whatcha doin'?!
407008 Alright, now everypony split up. We'll each patrol our own row of the orchard. Whoever or whatever's destroyin' my apples has gotta be here somewhere.
40700e I have a bad feeling about this. A really bad feeling about this... That apple... It looks... [entranced] so juicy... and sweet... [slurps]
407000 [biting]
407007 What was that?! [gasps] Suspicious! [giggles] It's pony signal time!
40700d Who's there? Oh, well, there's obviously no need to worry about that shadowy figure overhead... [frightened] Or maybe there is! I think I'll just go see how Rainbow Dash is doing...
40700c Uh... who's there? Answer me or you'll regret it! Fine, have it your own way! Take that, you, you, you... scarecrow... Oh.
407000 [rustling]
407000 [owl hoots]
407003 [gasps]
407000 [slurping]
407003 Applejack, what is it?
407007 Suspicious!
40700e [hisses]
40700e [slurps]
407007 Fluttershy? Yoo-hoo! Fluttershy!
40700e [hisses]
40700d That's not Fluttershy... That's Flutterbat!
407003 We've gotta get her down from there!
40700d Uh... Fluttershy, sweetness, please come down, and... do stop being a vampire bat.
40700e [hisses] [slurps]
40700c Fluttershy! It's me, Rainbow Dash! Why don't you cut the bat act and come on down?!
40700e [hisses]
40700c [yelps] Whoa! Maybe we should just let her come down when she's ready.
407007 Flutterbat on the loose! Run for your lives!
407003 Pinkie Pie, calm down! See? She's back on her... branch.
407007 She's just biding her time! Waiting for the right moment to pounce!
407008 Pinkie Pie, bats don't eat ponies. Not even vampire bats.
407007 But maybe vampire ponies eat other ponies! I'm not taking any chances!
40700d How did this happen? That's what I don't understand.
407003 I think this was actually our fault.
40700c Our fault?
407008 And how'd you figure that?
407000 [magic humming, synth-electronic noises]
407003 Okay, so this is me, these are the bats, and this is Fluttershy doing her Stare. The spell was supposed to go right onto the bats like this, but somehow the spell must have backfired. It took the vampire fruit bats' desire to be vampire fruit bats and transferred that desire into Fluttershy. C'mon! We'll reverse the spell and make it right!
407007 Then what are we waiting for? Let's save Fluttershy before that thing eats us all!
40700c Hit the deck!
40711a [yelps]
407007 Follow that bat!
40700d I can't believe we lost her!
407003 Oh, Fluttershy, where are you?
40700e [hisses] [slurps]
407008 Look out! Whoa!
40700c If she keeps this up, your whole crop will be gone in no time!
407008 That's the least of my worries. I just want my friend back.
407003 We'll never get her back unless we corner her and catch her so I can reverse the spell!
407000 [wolf howling]
407003 [hushed] There she is!
40700e [hisses]
407008 There she goes!
407003 Oh, this is no use. I think the only way we're gonna catch her is if we find a way to lure her closer to us.
407008 But even if we can lure her to us, how're we gonna get her to stay still long enough for you to do your reverse spell?
407007 Aww, if only we had Fluttershy to do her Stare on the Flutterbat.
407003 [gasps] That's it!
407003 Okay, let's get our friend back. Action stations!
40700c So much for having the winning apple in the Appleloosa State Fair, huh?
407008 [sighs]
40700e [sniffs] [hisses]
40700c [hushed] She's coming!
40700e [hisses]
407000 [magic humming]
40700e Oh... where am I?
407015 [cheering]
407008 Thank goodness you're okay!
40700e But... what happened to me?
407007 You turned into a vampire pony!
40700e [gasps] I tried to eat ponies?!
407007 Of course not!
40700e So I wasn't a vampire?
407007 Yes!
40700e Yes I was, or yes I wasn't?
407007 Yes, you were!
40700e But I didn't try and eat ponies?
407007 Yes!
40700e I did?!
407007 No!
40700e I'm confused...
40700d Me too... and I was there!
407000 [bats chittering]
407008 Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I didn't take your suggestion in the first place.
40700e And don't forget, now you'll get seeds that will grow into even bigger and better apple trees.
40700c Does that mean what I think it means?
407008 Yup! More cider too.
40700c Yea-he-heah, whoo!
407005 Okay, got the part about the spell, Fluttershy turning into a bat, building a sanctuary...
407008 Be sure to put in there that I came to see that my short-term solution was a little short-sighted.
40700e And that you shouldn't let anypony pressure you into doing something that you don't think is right. Sometimes you have to tell even your closest friends 'no'.
407008 Now, how about we celebrate our stronger than ever friendship with a nice, ripe, juicy apple?
407007 [fake accent] Stand back! I vant to suck its juuuice! [squee]
407012 [laughing]
408005 There you are, Rarity! That's the last of your bags.
40800d Actually, Spike, I've got one last pile of bags, over there. Won't you be a dear?
408005 Sure... I'll be a dear... [strains]
40800d An entire week in the fabulous city of Manehattan! Plus, all of my very best friends there with me!
408003 Of course we'd all come along to support you during Fashion Week, Rarity!
40800e Not that you'll need it. We're sure you'll win.
40800d [squeals] I can't begin to tell you how excited I am that you'll all be there with me! However... Perhaps I can show you...
408003 What's that?
408007 Ooh, ooh, ooh, I know! A paper fan!
40800d No, it's—
408007 A magic trick! You know, where I pick a card and remember what it is and then you put it back in the deck so you can't look at it and—
40800d These are tickets to the hottest musical on Bridleway!
408003 You couldn't mean Hinny of the Hills... because that show's been sold out for months! Or could you?!
40800d I could. I do.
408003 [gasps] Oh, Rarity, you didn't have to do that, but... since you did...
40806c [cheering]
408007 This trip is fun already! I love jumping up and down! Whee-hee!
408000 [theme song]
408000 [train engine chugging]
40800d Come along, ponies! I found us a place to stay only a block from the train station in the very heart of this glorious metropolis!
408008 Hey, look! That's the theatre where Hinny of the Hills is playin'!
408024 [oohing]
408003 Wow, Rarity! How'd you manage to get us seats for tomorrow night?
40800d Oh, I gave some designs to the costume designer, so he pulled a few strings.
40816c Cool!
40800d That is what makes Manehattan so splendid and amazing. You do something nice for somepony, and then you never know when they'll do something nice for you!
408008 So then you can do something nice for us!
40800e Like get us in to see Hinny of the Hills!
40800c Which is only the best musical in all of Equestria!
408008 It must be good if Rainbow Dash is impressed. Normally she doesn't even like musicals.
40800c I know. Ponies just bursting into song in random places at the drop of a hat? Who does that?
40800d [Rarity]
40800d Oh Manehattan, what you do to me
40800d Such a huge bustling community
40800d And there's always opportunity
40800d To do the friendly thing
40800d If some are grouchy, pay no mind
40800d Surprise instead with something kind
40800d Lo and behold, you may just find
40800d A smile is what you bring
408207 Welcome to the Manefair Hotel! Please allow me to take those bags to your room for you!
40800d Only if you'll accept this gratuity first.
408207 Oh-ho-ho! I'll get your change!
40800d Do keep it all. I insist!
40800d [Rarity]
40800d Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can give
40800d Generosity, I'm here to set the bar
40800d Just sit back and watch how I live
40800d After you.
408208 Why, thank you.
40800d Please, take mine.
408111 Wow, okay.
40800d [Rarity]
40800d Some may say, "Rarity,
40800d Don't be so big-hearted and bold
40800d Treating strangers like they're friends
40800d This town's too big and cold"
40800d But this is how I play my cards
40800d I'm not about to fold
40800d Where I see a frown, I go to town
40800d Call me the smile patrol
40800c [Rainbow Dash]
40800c Oh Manehattan, what you do to us
40800e [Fluttershy]
40800e What if you find a Gloomy Gus?
408008 [Applejack]
408008 It's no intimidatin' thing
408007 [Pinkie Pie]
408007 Just be kind without a fuss
40800d [Rarity]
40800d Generosity, I'm here to show all that I can do
40800d Generosity, you are the key
40800d Manehattan, I'm here just for you
40800d Just for you
40800d [sigh] To think my dresses could soon be displayed on the most glamorous shopping thoroughfare of the most glamorous city in Equestria! Oh, it would be my dream come true!
408003 Is there anything left to do we can help you with?
40800d Hm, nothing I can think of. The dresses are all completely finished, all made from a fabulous new fabric I've been developing for months. Stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery, but not showy.
40800e Sounds amazing.
40800d There's nothing left for me to do but check in at the runway with my dresses by two this afternoon.
408007 Oh, that's funny. Because that clock over there makes it seem like that's only ten minutes from now!
408000 [thunder rumbling]
40800d Oh, my ribbons and threads. And the runway ballroom is all the way across town! If I don't get there, I'm disqualified! Taaaaxiii!
40800e Oh, no! We've gotta help her find a cab, now!
40800c I'm on it! Hey, buddy! Is this cab taken?
4080be The line ends back there, "buddy"!
40800c Huh? What? Does everypony in this town want a cab?
40800d I'm afraid getting a taxi at this time could prove almost impossible!
408003 Please won't you let her have this taxi? She has somewhere very important to be right away!
408209 Not likely! She can get in line like the rest of us!
40800f [complaining]
408003 Oh, it's no use! The cab drivers just drive right past to get to the next pony in line!
40820a New wheel works like a charm! So now which of you nice folks are hoppin' in?
40800d Fashion runway plaza in seven minutes. Can you make it?
40820a Hang on!
40800d Ta-ta!
408005 Whew, that was close.
4080da [general agreement]
408005 Anypony else got a sneaking suspicion we're forgetting something?
4080da The dresses!
40800d [out of breath, quickly] Good afternoon, I'm here for Fashion Week!
40820b Everypony's gathered in front of the runway and about to start, so you'll just have to bring your dresses along with you and store them backstage later.
40800d My– My dresses! How could I possibly forget them?! [gasps] I'm dooooomed!
408207 Got 'em right here, ma'am! Your friends told me you need these in a hurry, so I offered to race 'em over myself. "Anything for that nice mare," I told 'em!
40800d You're a lifesaver!
40800d [sighs] I made it! And with seconds to spare! Hello, everypony. Pleased to meet you all.
40820c Rarity, I presume.
40800d You must be Prim Hemline, the host of this grand event. How do you—?
40820c Miss Rarity, how is it that all your competitors are here half an hour early, and yet you arrive seconds before we begin?
40800d Uhhhh... [chuckles nervously] Just... lucky, I guess.
40820c Once we're done here, you're to finish setting up backstage so you'll be ready for your run-through appointment. You show your designs last. We keep to a precise schedule, so let's try to be more than a few seconds early, hmm? Tomorrow is the contest to see which one of you gets to stay to meet top designers all across the city. The rest of you must go home early. So sad. Dismissed!
40820d [chuckles] I'm so glad you made it, Rarity!
40800d Me too, but everything just seems to keep working out!
40820d Don't you remember me? Suri Polomare from the Ponyville Knitters League?
40800d Oh, yes, of course, of course! I– I thought you looked familiar, but I couldn't place it. You haven't been back in years!
40820d Because I moved here to make it in the big city. [laughs], okay?
40800d Oh, good for you, Sur—
40820d Ooh, it's so good to see you! And now here we are, competing! [laughs], okay?
40800d Yes, yes. Well, good luck!
40820d Oh, I don't need luck. Would you like a hoof with your things?
40800d Why, thank you so much!
40820d My, your collection is gorgeous!
40800d Oh now, I'm sure your collection is equally lovely, if not more so!
40820d It's alright, but nothing like this! Take my culottes, for example – they are simply crying out for just the right accent, but I haven't the slightest notion where I— [gasps] Actually... just a touch of this fabric could be perfect with it. W– Oh, hey, would you mind terribly if I took a swatch?
40800d Oh, not at all! Here, I have loads extra.
40820d You're sure?
40800d Positive! Oh, well, it's been wonderful getting caught up, and I don't wish to be rude, but I must finish my preparations and I am a bit late as it... is?
40800d Hello! I'm here half an hour early for my run-through appointment, just the way Prim likes!
40820b Get in line over there. Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous, did you make that yourself?
40800d Oh, why, yes. It's stretchy, but not clingy. Shimmery—
40820d [simultaneously] Shimmery, but not showy. And the entire line is in the same adorable pattern. It works on everything from skirts to tops to shoes and, [chuckles]...
40820c Oh, bravo! I've never seen anything like it!
40800d You stole my fabric!
40820d [laughs] I didn't steal it, okay? You gave it to me, 'member?
40800d I gave you the fabric for accents! Not for your whole line! And how could you possibly make all of those outfits out of it so fast?!
40820d Fast? Hah! Coco Pommel here took practically forever. Nearly got me completely disqualified.
40820e Well, I wanted to make sure you'd win, so I took the extra time to—
40820d Quiet! I pay an assistant to sew and get coffee, not talk. 'Kay?
40800d [gasps] How could this happen?
40820d Aw, sweetie, don't blame yourself. It takes some small-town fillies a while to learn it's everypony for herself in the big city, m'kay?
40800d [crying]
40820d Hope you realize how fortunate you are to have me as a mentor. Now get me some coffee!
408003 Oh, my gosh, what a great afternoon! That was almost too much fun!
40800c Better pace yourself, 'cause the rest of the day is jam-packed!
408008 First there's the salon appointment to get our manes done.
408007 Then our fancy dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern!
40800e And after that...
4080da Hinny of the Hills! [laughing]
40800c Is... everything okay?
408007 You got the dresses the bellhop brought you and everything, right?
40800d [bawls]
40800c But he said he brought them.
40800d [crying] And then Suri stole them! [fast breathing] I let one of the other contestants use some of my one-of-a-kind fabric [fast breathing] and then she turned it into a wardrobe just like mine, [fast breathing] only now it looks like I'm the one copying her! My generosity has ruined me, I tell you! Ruined! [bawls]
408003 Now, Rarity, whatever went wrong, we're all here to help you get through it, no matter what it takes.
40820f [general agreement]
408008 Come on, Rarity, buck up! All we need is some fabric and you'll be back in business!
40800d [gasps] This new line is going to be marvelous! Perhaps even better than the last! It's daring, it's bold! Perhaps I still have a chance after all!
408000 [sewing machines whirring]
40800d Twilight! Sew these pieces together according to that pattern there!
408003 You said if we skipped dinner at the Far-Afield Tavern, you'd order a meal for us while we keep working.
40800d Don't fret. It'll be here in an hour. That's not going to be a problem, is it?
40800c Well, we're supposed to be watching Hinny of the Hills by then...
40800d Oh! I see! I go out of my way to get you tickets for a show, and this is how you repay me? By abandoning me in my hour of need? Oh, oh, oh! Fine! Go and see Hinny of the Hills tonight! And then tomorrow morning when you come to see my fashion show without any fashion to show, you can have more entertainment! "Oh, why look, there's our friend Rarity going down in flames! Isn't friendship magic?!"
408003 Rarity, calm down. What's gotten into you?
40800d What's gotten into you?! Oh, go ahead! See your little show! Congratu-pony-lations, fillies! Sounds like you've all figured out already it's everypony for herself in this town!
408000 [door slams]
408000 [sewing machines whirring]
408000 [clicking]
408003 There. That's the last of them.
40800d [gasps] Finally!
408003 You're welcome!
40820c Let's have another round of applause for Suri Polomare's amazing collection.
408000 [ponies cheering]
40820c That fabric! So original!
40800d [sighs]
40820d [chuckles] Well look who's here. Here to show off your copycat collection, mm? Heh.
40820c And now, Rarity from Ponyville with her brand new line – and I mean "brand new" – Hotel Chic.
408000 [ponies talking excitedly]
408000 [cameras clicking]
40800d Oh! They're liking it! I think I may have just won this thing! Oh, I can't wait to celebrate with... My friends. They didn't come. What have I done?
408000 [ponies cheering]
408000 [cameras clicking]
40820c Rarity, they all adore you! Aren't you going to tell them about your fabulous pieces?
40800d I have to go.
40820c [gasps] Come back at once!
408000 [audience gasps]
40820c This is unheard of!
408207 How do you do, ma'am? Contest going well?
40800d No time to talk. I have to find my friends!
408207 Oh, uh, they're gone already. I saw them headed out this morning.
40800d Oh, no! Back to Ponyville, I imagine. Oh, they worked so hard on my behalf! And I repaid them with unkindness. What have I done?! Oh... here you are.
408207 But miss, I– I didn't do anything!
408000 [thunder rumbling]
40800d [Rarity]
40800d Oh Manehattan, what have I done?
40800d The thought of Fashion Week was fun
40800d But I went way too far
40800d My friends gave to me in ways so kind
40800d And I gave them nothing but a hard time
40800d And now alone I stand
40800d And now alone I stand
408000 [bell rings]
40800d I need a moment with Prim Hemline. I have to rush back to Ponyville, but I just wanted to thank her first for—
40820d Uh-uh-uh, you'd best steer clear of Prim for a while. She's pretty furious. Isn't that right?
40820e Um... yes.
408007 [squee]
40800d There you all are! I can't believe it, I thought you went back home!
408003 We missed the show because we overslept. Suri told us you lost. I'm really sorry.
40800d I lost? You know what? I don't even care. I'm just happy you're all still here after how I treated you. Taking advantage of your friendship the way I did. How could you ever see past it?
408008 Yeah, you were pretty rotten.
40800c Wow, Applejack. I know your thing is honesty, but come on!
408003 Last night we may not have seen you at your best, but we know you. And we would never let one thing like that change how we feel about you.
40800d Oh, thank you! You really are the most wonderful friends a pony could have! You know, I already arranged to make it up to you this afternoon! Hope you're all available for an exclusive performance of Hinny of the Hills!
40806c [cheering]
40820d And that is how it's done. Pretty clever how I convinced her to stay away from Prim, wasn't it? [chuckles] Wouldn't have wanted her to find out the truth now, would we?
408210 [singing] And I'm a dancing pony!
408012 [cheering]
408008 Wow! That was even better than I imagined!
40800c I loved it! [beat] Uh, I mean, it was a'ight.
408211 [laughing]
408003 How did you ever get them to agree to do an extra performance just for us?
40800d Remember my costume designer friend who got me the tickets? Well, I offered to make all the costumes for his next show!
40800e Um, here in Manehattan?
40800d Well, um... yes... it will keep me away from Ponyville for a while.
40806c [sighs]
40800d But I so wanted you to see this show! And working for this designer is such a great opportunity!
408008 We know. We're happy for you, Rarity. We're just sad for us.
40820e Mind if I join you?
40800d Sure. Come on down. This is the first place trophy for Fashion Week. [gasps] With my name on it! But I thought I lost!
40820e You didn't. You won. Suri was hoping that if you didn't claim your prize, the judges would consider it a forfeit and first place would go to her. So she lied to make you and your friends go away, and, well, I lied too. I've worked for Suri for so long, I started to believe that it really is everypony for herself in this town. Until I saw how generous you were with your friends and how generous they were with you. It made me start believing there was something better for me out there. So, I– I quit. I brought you something to say thank you.
40800d Hm. I suppose you'll need a job now that you're no longer with Suri. How would you like to work for my friend making all the costumes for his next show?
40800d Manehattan was simply grand. It was in this magnificent metropolis that I learned that, while there are ponies who will take advantage of your generosity, you should never, ever let that cause you to abandon your generous spirit. Nothing feels worse than taking advantage of the giving nature of your friends.
408000 [credits]
409007 Whatcha doin'?
409003 Aaagh!
409007 "Aaagh" yourself! But that doesn't answer my question, silly. [giggles]
409003 Just some genealogical research.
409007 Ohhh. [whispering] I don't know what that is.
409005 Genealogy is the study of family history. Y'know, where ponies come from and who they're related to.
409007 Ooh, fascinating.
409003 Maybe you should pick one from the... top?
409007 Uh-huh... Interesting... I see... Hmm, that makes sense... Not much of a surprise there... WHAT?!? This is the most amazing thing ever! Why didn't you tell me how amazing this is?! Genealogy is better than cotton candy on top of a fountain of chocolate! [thud] You'll never believe who it says I'm related to!
409000 [knocking]
409007 Hey, cousin!
409000 [theme song]
409008 This is just so excitin', I can hardly believe it!
409007 I know! Isn't it the best?
40900a I have another sister! I have another sister!
409007 Well, you actually have a fourth cousin twice removed by a fifth cousin, but that's like exactly like a sister!
409008 I'd try to tone it down a little around non-family members, because I don't want to make them jealous, but...
40900a This is the best family ever!
409000 [sproing]
409008 It really is. You are gonna love bein' an Apple. I mean, you've got the playful one...
409000 [boing, thud, boing]
409007 [clapping]
409008 The strong one...
409026 Eeyup.
409000 [splat]
409008 And of course, there's Granny Smith, who knows everythin' about everythin'!
409009 A Ponyville snail can hibernate for up to forty-eight moons!
409007 Who knew?
409008 And then there's me. [sniffs, exhales] Do you smell that sweet apple air, Pinkie Pie?
409007 [sniffs]
409008 That was rhetorical. Of course you smell it. You're an Apple now!
40900a And Applejack is the one responsible for it!
409008 Aw, Apple Bloom, that is sweet, but--
40900a It's true! I mean she keeps us all organized and on schedule and does her own part on top of it all!
409212 Mm-hmm.
409007 I was already super happy as a Pie! And now I get to be a part of this amazing family too?
40900a It's even more amazin' now that you're in it! [rhythmically] We're family, we're family, you an' me are family!
409007 Best family twirl everrrrrrr!
409000 [crash]
409008 Huh, I just can't believe we've never heard anythin' about this before! Hmm...
40900a What's wrong, sis?
409008 I'm not seein' where exactly it says we're family.
409007 It's riiiiiiiii- [inhales] -iiiiiight here!
409008 It... is?
409007 Uh-huh. [reading] Applesauce of the Apple family lineage is a fourth cousin twice removed of the Pie family!
409008 I see the part about our great, great auntie Applesauce and fourth cousin twice removed part, but that last bit's awful smudged. Are you sure it says 'Pie'?
409007 I guess it is a little smudged, but I see most of it there, and when I read it, I knew in my heart it was true!
409009 Well, ain't that just the sweetest thing!
409008 It is, it is. I'd just hate for us to get all excited before we found out for sure.
40900a So how are we supposed to find out for sure?
409009 Ehhhh... Oh! Cousin Goldie Delicious! Her cabin's practically an Apple family history museum! If anypony has the records to back up Pinkie's theory, it's her!
409008 Huh, I suppose we could always... I mean, Goldie Delicious doesn't live that far away, and we haven't been on one as a family in a real long time... Are y'all thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
40900b Family road trip!
409009 Has anypony seen my travelin' bonnet?
40900a Isn't that it on your head?
409000 [beat]
409009 No!
40900a It looks an awful lot like--
409009 Well, it ain't, and that's final!
409008 Hey, everypony? Since Pinkie Pie's back home gettin' her stuff for the trip, can y'all gather round? I just wanted to say somethin' real quick.
409009 I've had somethin' in my teeth this whole time, haven't I? Gadsnickety, what a way to welcome a family member!
409008 Er, no, Granny, your teeth are fine. I just wanted to be sure that we're all on the same page about showin' Pinkie Pie how awesome a family we really are. We want her to get to know the family she's been born into, but, like, the best version of it, y'know?
409009 Oh, [blows raspberry]. Don't you worry, honey. We're a great family, and she can't help but see it.
40900a I'll bet my future cutie mark's gonna be a picture of me bein' the best behaved pony ever! That's how good I'm gonna be! Big Mac?
409026 Eeyup.
409007 Are y'all ready to go? Because I'm ready to go-go-go!
409008 Er, Big Mac? Are you sure we really need all that stuff?
409026 Eeyup.
409008 Are you sure you're strong enough to really pull all that stuff?
409026 Eeyup.
409008 Are you sure the wagon's strong enough to hold it all?
409026 [groans] Eeyup!
409008 Then let's get this show on the road!
409000 [wagon creaking and clanging rhythmically]
409008 C'mon, Apples, y'all know this one!
409009 Hot-diggity!
409008 Yee-haw!
409026 Eeyup.
409008 [Applejack]
409008 We've traveled the road of generations
409008 Joined by a common bond
409008 We sing our song 'cross the pony nation
409008 From Equestria and beyond
409000 [Applejack and Apple Bloom]
409000 We're Apples forever, Apples together
409000 We're family, but so much more
409000 No matter what comes, we will face the weather
409000 We're Apples to the core
409026 Eeyup.
40900a [Apple Bloom]
40900a There's no place that I'd rather be
40900a Than travelin' with my family
40900a Friends all around come to join and see
40900a As we sing out across the land
409000 [Applejack, Big McIntosh, and Apple Bloom]
409000 We're Apples forever, Apples together
409000 We're family, but so much more
409000 No matter what comes, we will face the weather
409000 We're Apples to the core
409026 Eeyup.
409009 [Granny Smith]
409009 We're peas in a pod, we're thick as thieves
409009 Any cliché you can throw at me
409009 We're here for each other, through thick and thin
409009 You're always welcome with your Apple kin
409009 Wheeeeee!
409007 [Pinkie Pie]
409007 You're more fun than the color pink
409007 Or balloons flying over your favorite drink
409007 The love I feel here is swim, not sink
409007 As we party across this land
4090dd All right!
40904d [All]
40904d We're Apples forever, Apples together
40904d We're family, but so much more
40904d No matter what comes, we will face the weather
40904d We're Apples to the core!
409026 Eeyup!
409000 [crash]
409008 Big Mac! I thought you said– Uh, I thought– I mean, not that I'm blamin' you, because we don't blame in this family, but I thought you said all this stuff wasn't gonna be too heavy.
40900a How're we supposed to get to Goldie Delicious now?
409009 I don't know, but I don't see how we can go back now either. We're closer to cousin Goldie's than we are to home.
409007 [gasps] I have the best... idea... ever! Family river trip!
409008 Heh. Just one problem. We haven't got a raft. [under her breath] 'Bout the only thing that didn't get packed.
409009 Well, back in the old days, we used to use the sap from a sugar pine tree to glue things together.
409008 That is, uh, fascinatin'... Don't know that it's helpful, but it is fascinatin'...
409009 Pfft! 'Not helpful', my patootie! We're gonna build ourselves a raft out of these here jalopy parts and keep it held together with sugar pine sap!
409008 Hm, worth a shot!
409007 Woo-hoo!
409008 Could be worse, I guess. Now remember, this time we're only packin' the necessities.
409007 Wait a second!
409000 [camera clicks]
409007 This one is for the scrapbook!
409008 Pinkie Pie, when did you have time to make this?
409007 Applejack, when you're family, you make the time.
409000 [splash]
409008 Woo-hoo! We did it!
409007 Say 'soaked'!
409000 [camera clicks]
409007 So what you're saying is, if I have the courage to jump, the parachute will open.
409026 Eeyup.
409007 Whoa! That is deep!
409026 Eeyup.
409008 Uh-oh... All right, y'all. Please tell me that the map didn' get wet. 'Cuz it looks like I'm gonna need it right about now.
40900a Found it!
40900a Who's got the map?
40900a I got the map!
40900a M to the A to the yeah, that's right, P
40900a Ain't no other pony found a map like me
40900a I'm Apple— uh-oh.
409008 [gasp]
409213 [screams]
409000 [splash, splash, camera clicks]
40900a [laughs nervously]
409008 [through gritted teeth] All you had to do was bring it to me. No singin', no dancin', no games. Just walk it over!
409026 [through gritted teeth] Eeyup.
409007 Say 'best siblings ever'!
409000 [camera clicks]
409007 Ooh, that's another keeper!
409009 It's okay, y'all! I travelled down this river as a filly and I know it like the back of my hoof!
409008 Are you sure you know which way to go?
409009 Does a June bug like to hide in a tree?
409008 Uh... I don't know.
409009 Well, I do know! And I also know we wanna head southeast! Now step aside, young'un!
409008 Um, Granny?
409009 Myuh-huh?
409008 Are we supposed to go through a cave?
409009 Ah, don't worry, child! The scariest cave in Equestria was down that other way!
40900a The scariest cave in Equestria?
409009 Oh, it's a fright all right! Filled with creatures that'll eat ya soon as look at ya!
409007 Ooh, sounds scary. Tell us more!
409009 Ponies go in... but they never come out!
409008 And you're sure it's not that cave? The one we're headin' straight for?
409009 Now, Applejack, I taught you better than to question your elder ponies!
409007 [squee]
409008 Heh... you sure did.
409009 Alrighty then. Now everypony just sit on back an' leave the steerin' to your old Granny Smith.
409008 [gulp]
409009 See now? Told ya th--
409000 [roaring]
40900b [screaming]
409000 [camera clicks]
409007 Got it! Best scary unidentifiable creature ever! Say 'terrified'!
40900b [continue screaming]
409000 [camera clicks]
409007 [hums]
409009 Guess that was the scariest cave in Equestria. Uh, of course I meant to take us through it! Unexpected adventure is good for the soul!
409007 Best granny wisdom ever!
409008 Uh-huh. Why don't you just scooch on over there, Granny? Think I'll take it from here on out.
409009 Huh! Is that how I taught you to treat your elder ponies?
409007 Ooh! Ooh! Is it?
409008 You taught me to trust my common sense. And my common sense says we should get to Goldie Delicious's cabin in one piece.
409009 And that is exactly what I'm gonna do!
409008 That is mighty generous of you, but I think you've done enough for one day.
409009 And how exactly are you gonna know which way to go?
409007 Hmmmmmmm?
409008 It would be easier if the map hadn't gone overboard!
40900a Hey! There wouldn't have been an overboard if Big Mac hadn't overpacked the jalopy!
409026 Eeyu- hey!
409008 Exactly! So I think we can all agree that from here on out, I should be in charge of everythin'.
40900b [arguing]
409000 [splash, duck quacks, eagle cries]
409008 [laughs nervously]
409007 I just wanna say... that I think you're all super duper, and I can't wait to make a page in my scrapbook about the amazing waterfall we went down!
409000 [water rushing]
409000 [duck quacks]
40900b [panicked cries] [screams]
40900b [screams]
409007 Wheeeee!
409000 [camera clicks]
409000 [splash]
409009 Huh! Told you that sugar pine sap would hold this thing together.
409000 [crunch]
40900b [yelps]
409000 [balloons pop]
409007 [yelps]
40900b [groaning]
409007 We're here! We're here! We made it to Goldie Delicious's's's's's! You guys! There's a note! [giggles]
409008 Uh, Pinkie Pie? Maybe you could read that one out loud?
409007 Oh, right, sorry! I haven't even read it yet. I was just looking at how pretty the paper is. Okay, it says that she ran off to run some errands but will be home soon! Oh, that's perfect!
40900a Why is that perfect?
409007 Because it'll give me enough time to get more scrapbook paper! See ya!
40900a Worst family road trip. Ever.
409026 [sadly] Eeyup.
409008 I can't believe she witnessed our family fallin' apart like this. [sighs] I can't believe I was arguin' with you so much that I tore the wheel right off the raft. It's like I wasn't myself at all.
409009 Aw, that wasn't your fault. My stubborn streak got a hold of me somethin' fierce. Should've let you take the wheel long a'fore that.
40900a It was my fault the map got all wet...
409026 I was the pony who—
409009 Now, now, Big Mac, you gotta know we forgive you for packin' the jalopy so much that it collapsed. You was just as eager to please Pinkie Pie like the rest of us.
409008 Everypony, I think we have to let Pinkie Pie know that even if she does discover that she's an Apple, she does not have to feel obliged to consider herself one.
409009 Sure as applesauce.
409007 Are you kidding me?! You guys are the best family ever!
409008 How can you say that? We started out as one big unit, and now look at us.
409007 Yeah! Now look at you! You're all here still in one big unit, loving each other and owning up to what went wrong! You never gave up, even when things got tough!
40900a She does make a pretty good point.
409007 You aren't just family, you're best friends! And I wanna be an Apple more than ever!
40900a And we want you to be one too!
409007 Yippee! [giggles]
409214 Now that's how you run an errand.
409007 Hello!
409214 Hello yourself!
409008 You must be Goldie Delicious. So nice to meet you.
409214 Uh-huh. And who exactly are you?
409007 We're Apples!
409008 Well, we think we're all Apples. But we need your help finding out if Pinkie Pie here is our fourth cousin twice removed.
409214 Well why didn't you say so? If anypony can help solve this genealogy mystery, it's me!
409000 [door creaking]
409214 [straining] Oh, I am sorry about this. I wasn't exactly expectin' company. Lemme try to squeeze in here... [straining]
409000 [cats complaining]
409214 Gotta... get some oil... for the hinges...
409000 [crashing, cat noises]
409214 Alrighty then, just have to move a few things out of the way of the door. Ooh! Ah! Get off of that, Mr Fluffy... Come on, Pooples... come here, sweetheart... Come on in! Sorry about the mess!
409000 [cats meowing]
409008 Whoa!
409214 Oh, careful now. Those belonged to your great-great-great-great uncle Apple Tart!
40900a Well, whose was this?
409214 Well, that was my lunch. A couple of weeks ago.
409000 [cats purring]
409214 [puffs] [straining] This here is a complete record of, of our family tree! It's not here, or here, or, or here, or it certainly isn't here, is it...? Oh, here it is! ...Oh, dear.
409009 'Oh, dear'? What is it?
409007 Am I not an Apple after all?
409214 Well, that's just it. I don't know. The page is all smudged. I sure am sorry, but I don't think I can help you out after all.
409007 Don't be sorry, it's okay. I'm just a little disappointed that I'll never know for sure if I'm a part of this family.
409008 Well, I know for sure!
409007 What do you mean? You can't know!
409008 I can know for sure that it doesn't matter what the book says or doesn't say. After all you've been through with us and all you've put up with, it's obvious you're an Apple to the core!
409009 Darn tootin'!
40900a Yes siree!
409026 Eeyup!
409007 Ooh! Say 'best family hug ever'!
40900b Best family hug ever!
409000 [camera clicks]
409008 Thanks again for the wagon, Goldie! We'll see you soon!
409214 Y'all sure you don't want to take any of these Apple family heirlooms home with you?
409000 [crash]
409000 [cat mews]
409026 Nnope.
40904d [All]
40904d We're Apples forever, Apples together
40904d We're family, but so much more
40904d No matter what comes, we will face the weather
40904d We're Apples to the core!
409026 Eeyup!
409008 Twilight agreed this was definitely an experience worth puttin' in the journal. Think I'll write about how bein' a good family isn't about bein' perfect as much as it is about bein' able to get through the rough patches together. About bein' able to forgive each other for mistakes.
40900a Don't forget to mention how really good friends can also feel like your family.
409026 Eeyup.
40900a You know what? Maybe I should write it. I'm good at makin' things sound excitin'.
409009 I have a history of excellent storytellin'. I should probably do it— Hey! Where in the haystack do you think you're goin' with that there pen?!
409026 I'm goin' to do- [voice drowned out]
40900b [arguing]
409007 Look at me! I'm part of the Apple family too! I'm arguing! Argue, argue, argue! Bicker, bicker! [laughs]
409000 [credits]
41000c Alright, ponies, listen up!
41000e We're all ears. Right, Bulk Biceps?
41017b [kissing noises] [grunts] Nuh-uh! I'm all muscles! Yeah!
41000c I like your attitude, Bulk Biceps, but it's gonna take more than muscles and Yeah!s to get us to the Equestria Games! We are the Aerial Relay team, and it's up to the three of us to make sure that we qualify at the tryouts. And do I need to remind you how much I— I mean, Ponyville, heh, wants to qualify and make it to the Games?
41000e I remember. I really, really, really want to qualify for you and Ponyville.
41017b Bring it on!
410007 Gimme a 'P' for 'Ponyville'!
41000e [yelps]
410007 [through megaphone] P, Ponyville!
41017b P!
41000e Oh, thanks, Pinkie Pie. That was a scary— I mean, great cheer. [laughs nervously]
41000c Just make sure you have one ready for when we qualify for the Aerial Relay.
41017b And after that, for when we win gold medals in the Equestria Games!
410008 Not so fast! If you're gonna be good, you're gonna be better with some of my apple brown bettys in ya. They're perfect.
410007 'P' is for 'perfect'!
410215 [chewing]
41000c Alright, team! Show me what you got! Put some bend into those knees! Flap those wings! And I want to see all four hooves off the ground on the count of three! [beat] [quickly] One two three!
41017b [straining noises]
41000c Don't forget to breathe while you're up there!
41017b [wheezes]
41000e [yelps]
410000 [thud]
410007 'P' is for, uhh... 'pain'?
41000c [sighs]
410000 [theme song]
410000 [train engine sounds]
410216 Good luck, Rainbow Dash! Sorry we couldn't fly with you on the Aerial Relay, but the air sprinters needed us too.
41017a Too bad we can only compete in one event. [sighs] But rules are rules.
410003 Good luck! [to Rainbow Dash] It was nice of you to be part of the team that doesn't have... uh... the strongest flyers.
41000c Nothing nice about it. I know that I can pick up the slack for anypony. With me on the team, we'll qualify. I'm sure of it.
410003 Ponyville is very lucky to have you.
41000c Yeah, I'm pretty awesome.
41000e [straining] [gasping] I am so proud to be representing Ponyville. [straining] Oh, it's such an honor to even try out for the Games. I just hope I don't let anypony down.
41017b We'll make them proud!
410007 'P' is for 'proud'! We're gonna be the best fans anypony has ever seen!
41000d Ooh. Can't wait to see what everypony else is wearing, even though I am absolutely sure they won't be better than the Ponyville uniforms I'm designing for the Equestria Games.
410008 And we will make it to the Games once everypony carbo-loads on my apple brown bettys.
410007 I can't wait!
410000 [train engine sounds]
41000f [excited chattering, groaning]
410217 There's Rainbow Dash! She's an awesome flyer!
4100f0 I heard that she's flying the last third of the relay, which means everypony else is gonna have to be way ahead to beat her!
410000 [distant boom]
410217 Oh, the Wonderbolts!
410218 I hear they're flying for Cloudsdale.
4100f0 Then Cloudsdale will definitely qualify. They're the best flyers ever.
41007c And the game is on!
41007b Hah, nice to see there's some real competition here!
410219 Two more days of practice, then we'll see you in the air, Rainbow Dash! If you're lucky.
41000c [sighs] The Wonderbolts know a winner when they see one, and we'll be winners just as soon as we practice! Right team?
41000e Right.
41017b Yeah!
410007 Hooray! [blows party hooter]
410000 [beat]
410003 And, um, I'm with her! Hooray!
41021a Give us some clouds! Give us some dale! And what do you get? Cloudsdale! Woo-hoo!
410007 [gasps] Where can I get pompoms like those?!
41000c So, do I need to remind you of what our goal is here?
41017b Uh, maybe?
41000c We want to qualify! We need to be one of the first four teams to cross the finish line! Bulk Biceps, you're the first flyer, so let me see you flap it!
41017b [grunts]
410000 [splat]
41000c What the?
410008 Sorry! Got the idea from them, but...
41021b Hooves down! Cakes up!
41021c [chewing]
410008 ...It looks like they got better aim.
41000c Okay, the passing of the baton needs to be seamless. You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude! And whatever you do, don't let go of it!
41000e Are you really, really, really sure you're ready? I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure.
41017b Ready!
410000 [clink, thud]
41000d Ponyville could do so much better. I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!
41000c We were using that! And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!
410000 [clink]
41000c [sighs] I guess some ponies do.
410003 Some ponies do what?
41000c [sighs] Have a better chance of qualifying and going to the Equestria Games than others.
41000c Watch and learn. The Cloudsdales are Wonderbolts, and Wonderbolts are the best flyers there are. And my personal heroes. So, maybe you can learn something.
410000 [jet engine sounds]
41000c Please learn something?
410219 C'mon, Soarin, pick up the pace! You can do better than that!
41007c I sure hope so.
41021a Practice, practice, yay, practice!
41007b Whoa!
410000 [sound of plane plummeting]
41007b Whooaaaa!
41007b Aaaaah! Help!
41000c Gotcha!
41021d [excited cheering]
410219 Awe-some!
41007c As good as any Wonderbolt!
41000e Oh, Rainbow Dash, I'm just so proud of you. You scooped Soarin out of the sky and brought him down to the ground and now, now he's okay. At least, I hope he's okay. [to Soarin] Are you okay?
41007b Uh, my wing hurts, but I-I'm sure it'll be okay by the competition.
410000 [siren wailing]
41007b You're the best, Rainbow Dash. [groans]
41000c Ah, it was nothin'. But, if you feel like talking about how great I am, don't let me stop you!
410000 [siren wailing]
41017b 'P' is for Rainbow Dash!
41000e [whispering] Um, 'Rainbow Dash' actually starts with an 'R'.
41017b Never mind!
41000c Tough break to lose a teammate right before the tryouts.
410219 You know, you grew up in Cloudsdale.
41007c So that means you could fly with us.
41000c Fly?
410219 Uh, we mean practice. You could practice with us until Soarin's better.
41007c What do you say? Wanna be our third?
41000c Uh, I don't know. My team really needs me to be at my best in order to qualify. Don't wanna be too worn out by the time the race comes around.
41007c We put you through some pretty intense workouts at the Wonderbolt Academy and you handled those just fine.
41000c Heh, I did kick some major tail at the Academy... but I don't know how my teammates will feel about me practicing with the competition.
410219 Who says they need to know? Think about it, Rainbow Dash! This is your chance to fly with the winners!
41017b [flexing muscles]
41000c Alright, I'll do it.
41007c [chuckles] Wise decision, Rainbow Dash.
410000 [training montage music]
410000 [clink]
410219 Awesome!
41021a Whinny, ponies, whinny! Fly on, fly on, fly on!
41017b [grunting]
41000c Come on, Bulk Biceps, you can do it!
410000 [creaking]
41000e Um... I'm ready to take the horseshoe, if you want me to.
410000 [clink]
410215 [screaming]
410000 [distant crash]
41000c Nnnngh...
410000 [training montage music]
410000 [squeaking]
41000e [yelps] Oof!
41000c You, uh, keep doing your wing-ups. I'm just gonna get some, uh, water.
410000 [training montage music]
41000e [chewing]
41017b [chewing] [laughs] [swallows] [grunts]
410134 [laughing]
410000 [training montage music]
410000 [buffing tool spinning]
410000 [hairdryer blowing]
410000 [scissors cutting]
41017b [laughs] Yeah!
41000e [giggles]
41000d Too much?
410000 [training montage music]
410000 [zip noise]
410000 [splash]
410003 It's not easy practicing with two teams, is it?
41000c [spit-take] You... know? Does anypony else?
410003 No. They're too busy practicing to wonder why you keep disappearing.
41000c Well, I've seen the other teams practicing and we're still gonna qualify. I can fly fast enough to make up the distance.
410003 It just seems like one of the teams you're practicing with needs a little more help than the other one.
41000c But it's so much more fun working out with the winners than... um... the non-winners. Besides, Ponyville will still qualify.
41007c Rainbow Dash, you got a minute?
41000c Uh, sure.
410219 You could really be an asset to our team, so... we want you to join the Cloudsdale team. Permanently.
41000c [gasps]
41007c It looks like Soarin's wing won't heal in time for the trials. We want you to fly with us.
410219 Of course, this means you won't be able to fly for Ponyville, but let's face it. Even with you on their team, their chances of qualifying for the Games—
41017b Ow!
410219 —are pretty slim.
41017b [whimpering]
41007c So, what's it gonna be?
41000c Well, I...
41007c Take some time to think about it.
41000c They want me to fly with them! It's like a dream come true!
410003 If you fly for Cloudsdale, Pinkie Pie won't have anypony to cheer for. Rarity's uniforms will never be seen. And Applejack will have slaved over those apple brown bettys for nothing.
41000c Oh, but I really wanna fly with the best team! What would you do?
410003 I think this is a decision you have to make on your own. The race is tomorrow, so you'd better make it soon.
410000 [anemometer spinning]
41000c [exaggerated groaning] Woe is me! Oooh!
4100ec [concerned chattering]
41000e What's happened?
41000c Urgh, I've hurt my hoof...
41001e [gasps]
41007c All of them?
41000c I, uh, tripped on a-a foam hoof and landed on a... [mumbles, near unintelligible] pokey stick coming out of the ground...
410007 [growls] If I get my hooves on that [matching unintelligible gibberish], it'll be in big trouble!
41000c There is no way I can fly now.
41000e Do you think you'll be better by tryouts?
41000c [exaggerated groaning] I'll be lucky if I ever fly again! [sighs] I just need a little rest.
41000e Oh, don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We'll take care of you... or, at least, somepony will. Like, a medic or-or a doctor, or a nurse.
410000 [EKG beeping]
410003 So, the medic pony isn't sure what's wrong with you.
41000c Everything! Absolutely everything!
410008 This'll cure everythin' that ails ya!
41000c [with mouth full] Thank you. I couldn't have done that on my own.
410003 [sighs]
41000d Nothing says 'get better' like a little medical pizazz! Silk slings and a glitter bandage?
41000c That might help.
410000 [door opens]
41000e And how is our patient doing?
410000 [thud]
41017b [neighs]
41000c I've been better.
41000e We just wanted to let you know that we're so sorry you're hurt, but you shouldn't worry a bit about not being able to be in the tryouts. We'll be alright. We even have a replacement. We're so, so sorry that you can't compete. We all know how much you love to fly. And we promise—
41017b Cross our hearts!
41000e ...That if we qualify and make it to the Equestria Games and all win gold medals, you can have ours, because we know how much a gold medal means to you.
41000c Thanks...
410003 [clears throat] I think Rainbow Dash might need to rest some more.
410025 [chattering]
410008 Don't forget your bettys!
410003 You know, choosing not to choose isn't really a decision.
41007b You sure have nice friends. Nopony's been by to visit me. Eh, too busy practicing, I guess.
41000c Well, hopefully your wing will be better soon.
41007b Oh, it's fine. I-I'm just keeping it warm in case my team wants me back.
41000c What do you mean, 'wants you back'? Spitfire and Fleetfoot told me that you were still too injured to fly!
41007b And they told me that they were worried I wouldn't be one hundred percent by the tryouts, so they were going with somepony else!
41000c That somepony else was me! Until, uh, well, until I got hurt, that is.
41007b So, [sighs] I guess we're all out of luck. Cloudsdale won't qualify without three fliers, and Ponyville won't qualify without you. Too bad...
410003 Even with Rainbow Dash's replacement, I don't think we're gonna qualify. No offense.
410007 Gah! What am I gonna do with all these now?!
410008 Uh, what were you gonna do with them before?
41000d [sighs] Maybe my Equestria Games uniforms will still be in style next year. I mean, I am pretty fashion-forward.
410000 [hoofbeats]
410003 Is that Rainbow Dash... walking?
41007c [drinking water]
410219 Does... this mean you're feeling better?
41000c I-I feel great, because... I was never hurt in the first place.
41021f [gasps]
410220 [gasps]
41000c I faked my injury so that I wouldn't have to choose between flying for Ponyville or Cloudsdale. I wanted to fly with you both, and the decision was too hard!
41000e Oh, Rainbow Dash, you don't have to choose us. I know you love to win, and you should go with the team that surely will.
41000c I know now who I should've been loyal to.
41007c Good choice. Always stick with the winners.
41000c Ponyville. Because it's not just where I live, but it's where my friends are. The ponies who really care about me, whether I can help them win a race or not.
410221 [cheering]
41007c Are you sure that's the right decision?
41000c You lied to me about Soarin's wing just so you could get a better flyer! You may be a winning team, but you're still not the kind of team I wanna be a part of.
41007c Huh. Rainbow Dash, you are something. Saw it at the Academy, seeing it again here. We could learn a lot from a competitor like you.
410219 Think we already have.
41007c Ready to fly?
41007b Really?
41007c Never should've lied and tried to replace you to begin with.
41007b [gasps] Go, Cloudsdale!
41000c Come on, Ponyville relay team! We've got a race to get ready for!
41017b Yeah!
410000 [click]
41007b Come on, Ponyville! You can do it!
410000 [flapping wings]
410000 [ticking]
410000 [clink]
410000 [fumbling]
41017b [wheezes]
410003 Go, Fluttershy! Woo-hoo!
41021a Qualify, Ponyville! Qualify, Ponyville!
410007 Woo-hoo! Go, Rainbow Dash!
410008 [chewing]
410222 Ponyville qualifies!
410000 [crowd cheering, neighing]
410000 [crowd cheering]
410000 [clicking]
41017b Yeah!
41011a Yeah!
410007 Woo-hoo!
410003 Equestria Games, here we come!
410000 [camera flashing]
41000c Oh, I can't deny it. I love to win! But if I ever gotta choose between winning and being loyal to my friends, I'm always gonna choose my friends. 'Cause as much as I love winning, I love them waaaaay more.
410000 [credits]
411000 [mailbox opening]
411000 [door closing]
411005 Mail's here!
411003 Please be a yes, please be a yes, please be a yes... Yes! She can make it, she can make it!
411005 Going out on a limb here, but I'm guessing that Princess Cadance said she can come this weekend!
411003 I'm finally gonna get to spend some quality time with my sister-in-law! This is the best news ever!
411000 [knocking on door]
41100e Um, so sorry for barging in like this... but I'm so excited, I just couldn't wait to tell somepony! The Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures have given me permission to observe the rarest, tiniest, most adorable magical creatures in all of Equestria – the Breezies!
411003 Wow, Fluttershy, that's fantastic!
41100e Oh, it's not just fantastic; it just might be the best news ever!
411000 [crash]
411007 I just got the most incredible mail anypony's ever received in all of recorded pony postal history! It's a flyer about a one-day sale on used patio furniture! Aah! Could this day get any better? Woo-hoo!
411000 [theme song]
411000 [train engine hissing]
41100d Here's a wrap, in case it gets cold.
411008 And I packed you a basket of nice fresh apples in case you get hungry.
411003 Have a great time!
41100e Oh, I will. And I hope you have fun with Cadance.
411000 [train whistle blowing]
41113e All aboard!
411000 [door closes]
411000 [train engine noises]
41100e Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony!
411007 Fluttershy! I'll never forget youuuuuuu! [beat] Ooh, something floaty! La-la-la-la-la!
411003 Oh, I'm a bit nervous about Cadance's visit!
411008 What could you be nervous about, Twilight? Cadance just loves you to pieces!
411003 I know, but I really want her visit to go without a hitch!
411007 Oh, why wouldn't it?
411003 Well, the last three times we've seen each other haven't exactly been worry-free.
41100d The fate of Equestria has hung in the balance during most of your visits with her.
411003 Exactly. Cadance and I haven't really had a chance to just enjoy being friends again. Which is why it is so important that this visit be about the two of us having some real quality time together.
411008 I'm guessin' you've got a plan that'll keep it that way.
411003 The timing couldn't be more perfect. For one day only, right here in Ponyville, the Star Swirl the Bearded Traveling Museum! Cadance and I can spend the whole day looking at Star Swirl the Bearded artifacts!
41100d Sounds like a perfect drama-free way to spend the day with Cadance.
411003 Not counting the drama surrounding which of the bells from his cloak they've chosen to put on display. Spoiler alert - it's this one!
41100c [hacks] Uh, sorry. Something in my throat... like a big ball of 'lame'!
41100d I think it sounds delightful.
411008 Yup, definitely sounds like you two will have some real quality time together.
411003 Exactly. Just quiet time.
411000 [train whistle blows loudly]
411000 [loud train engine noises]
411000 [fanfare]
411198 Your Highness.
411003 Your Highness.
411198 I'm teasing, Twilight. We're sisters-in-law. We don't have to be so formal.
411000 [train whistle blows]
411000 [train engine noises]
411198 Knowing you, you've made some plans.
411003 Boy, have I. Hang on just one second. [to rest of Mane Six] You guys-
41100d Now, now, don't you worry about a thing! We will make sure that nothing – but nothing – interferes with your visit.
411008 Go on, have a hootenanny with your kinfolk.
411003 You really are the best friends a pony could ever have. Coming, Cadance!
411007 [sighs] Two sisters-in-law bonding. Well, I for one am gonna make sure that nothing spoils their day!
411000 [something whistling in the distance]
411008 What is that thing?
41100d Whatever it is... duuuck!!!
411007 Rarity, that doesn't look anything like a duck!
411000 [crash]
41100c What is that?
4110db [sniffing] No, not a "what", but a "who", dear.
41100c Oh, no... That sounds like...
4110db [sneezes] [sniffs] Oh...
411048 Discord!
411008 What in tarnation are you doin' here? And why the jumpin' June bugs are you blue?
41100d More like a shade of cerulean, to be precise.
41100c Whatever color you are is the color of trouble!
4110db Oh, Rainbow Dash, I've changed, surely you remember? I was reformed by lovely little- [starts snorting] F-F-Fluttershy- [sneezes]
411008 What are you, sick or somethin'?
4110db Well, of course I'm sick. The blue skin? These sneezes? Could somebody find me a fainting couch?
411000 [beat]
41100d What?
4110db How charming, thank you. I can't stop sneezing and wheezing. In short... I need help. [whines]
41100c If you're so 'sick', why have you come here instead of, y'know, staying home in bed and getting over your weird illness?
4110db [sneezes] [blows nose] Because this condition has left me helpless, simply helpless! Why, I can barely lift a spoon.
411000 [clang]
4110db I came to find the one pony who truly understands me and could nurse me back to health. Where is that dear, sweet Fluttershy? I need attention! I need some care! I need-
41100c You need to chill. Fluttershy's out.
4110db Oh, of course, her trip to see the Breezies. Ah, yes, I had forgotten that was today.
411008 How do you know about her trip?
4110db Well, she told me about it in her last letter.
411007 You and Fluttershy write each other letters?
4110db Well, of course we do! We're friends! It's just such a shame that today of all days is when I really need her. Oh, well, I know what to do.
41100c Good thinking. Head on home, put your feet up. I'm sure eventually you'll have the strength to make yourself soup or something...
4110db Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no! I mean, while she's gone, you ponies can take care of me! Isn't that what friends are for, taking care of each other? [laughs] Let the healing begin!
41100c Not it!
4110db Well, that's some way to treat a suffering friend. [sneezes]
411007 Don't you worry, Discord! I'll give you cuddles, and read you stories, and tell you all about me! I was born on a Tuesday-
4110db Oh, you're so sweet to offer, but Rarity and Applejack already volunteered to be my own personal nursemaids. [chuckles]
411043 We did?
4110db I so hope you don't mind, Pinkie Pie.
411007 Well, as a matter of fact, I most certainly- Hey! Who keeps throwing away these perfectly good balloons?
411008 [hushed] That joker's up to something, and whatever it is, we're gonna keep it as far away from Twilight and Princess Cadance as possible.
411000 [ECG beeping]
41100d [hushed] You're right. We promised we wouldn't let anything ruin their visit... although I do so wish that "anything" had turned out to be something else!
4110db Did I hear you two talking about Princess Cadance's visit with Princess Twilight?
411008 Maybe.
4110db Fluttershy had mentioned that those two were getting together today. Mm-hm. How wonderful for them both. It is so rare that those two get to see one another. I don't know about you, but I sometimes wonder how close they could actually be. All those years apart before being reunited?
411008 They're plenty close.
4110db And if they're not, this rare opportunity to focus on their friendship will certainly bring them closer. Unless...
41100d Don't even think about it! They mustn't be disturbed!
4110db Disturb them? I wouldn't dream of it. Not when I have two such dear friends of my own who have already offered to take care of me. And at such peril! This flu of mine is highly- [snorts] [sneezes] contagious.
411043 [sneezes]
411000 [crash]
4110db Oh no, I've gotten you both sick. Whomever shall I turn to now in my time of need? [chuckles]
411003 A whole day to celebrate Star Swirl the Bearded. What could be better?
411198 Absolutely nothing. [gasps] Is that the candlestick he used to light the way when he was exploring the caverns of Maretania?
411003 It sure is!
411198 Oh, I can't believe I'm getting to see it in real life!
411000 [rattling]
41119d [yelps]
4110db [sneezes]
411003 Discord! What are you doing here?!
4110db Oh, dear, dear Princesses, I'm sorry to say that I'm sick. [hacks] Blue flu.
411198 Blue flu?
4110db Ah, I fear I've already given it to poor Applejack and Rarity. [sneezes]
411198 Magic health bubble.
411003 Good thinking.
4110db Indeed. How would Twilight nurse me back to health if she were sick too? You will be letting me stay at your place until I'm all better, won't you?
411003 Stay? With me?! Uh, now is not really the best time, though I'm sure you already knew that...
4110db But taking in the sick and the desperate - isn't that what Fluttershy would do? Isn't 'helping' something that friends do for friends? Unless, of course, you're really saying that you're not my friend.
411003 [through gritted teeth] No, that is not what I'm saying.
4110db Oh, how elated I am to hear that. Shall the three of us head back to your place? I don't want to get anypony else sick.
411003 [sighs] Guess we don't have much choice.
4110db Carry me?
411198 It isn't far. I think you can manage.
4110db Oh, poo.
411003 Need anything else?
4110db Just knowing that I have a good friend like you to take care of me has made me feel better already. I'll be fine here on my own. Oh, just before you go, just a little small request.
411003 [sighs]
411198 It's going to be fine. We'll just get him what he wants and be back to the exhibit in no time. What was it that you needed?
4110db [Discord]
4110db A little glass of water please
4110db A fresh pressed hanky if I sneeze
4110db Some tea with honey from the bees
4110db Whenever you can brew it
411198 I'll get your tea.
4110db [Discord]
4110db And while I get a little rest
4110db A teeny tiny small request
4110db Some codfish oil for my chest
4110db Poured from a crystal cruet
411003 A crystal cruet?
4110db [Discord]
411000 [singing faster]
411000 My goodness, I'm a nincompoop
411000 Because I fear I've got the croup
411000 I need a vat of pumpkin soup
411000 And scarves made out of zinnias
411000 Did I say zinnias? I meant silk
411000 Or something shiny of that ilk
411000 And then I'll need some nice warm milk
411000 And pastries from Abyssinia
411000 And since my stomach's feeling crummy
411000 Why not give my aching tummy
411000 Something soothing, something yummy
411000 Piled up with noodles?
411000 Add a slice of homemade rye
411000 With stacks of Swiss way up high
411000 Served with sides of sweet mince pie
411000 More basil; I need oodles!
411003 Anything else?
4110db [Discord]
4110db I'll be grateful for your charity
4110db Until the bitter end
4110db Because I've heard that tenderness
4110db Is what you lend an ailing friend
4110db Tenderness, isn't that right, friend?
411003 Right, but—
4110db So, who's ready for my big reprise?
4110db I'd like that glass of water please
4110db Some magic spell to cure disease
4110db A firm "gesundhoof" when I sneeze
4110db A fresh bouquet of roses
4110db Some lozenges will soon appease
4110db My wheezing when I start to sneeze
4110db A wig to keep me from the breeze
4110db And blankets for my toes-es
4110db Take tweezers out of my valise
4110db And then massage my knobby knees
4110db A bowl of peas, some extra cheese
4110db A cuddle with a Pekingese
4110db A singing harp who's named Louise
4110db A goat on skis, a new trapeze
4110db And more and more and more and more of these
4110db And just because I oughta...
4110db Make sure I'm drinking in the right
4110db Amount of fluids day and night
4110db I wish I may, I wish I might
4110db Have just one little thing
4110db Oh, would you please finally bring
4110db Me that tiny glass
4110db Of water?!!
411000 [coughs]
411000 [clink]
4110db Oops. Sorry. [sneezes]
411003 Alright, this is ridiculous!
411198 How did you even catch this flu?
4110db Inadequate hoof and claw washing?
411003 There must be some way to just cure you! There has to be a spell or remedy in one of my books!
4110db There is one way...
411198 And you didn't think to mention it earlier?
4110db Slipped my mind. On a hill at the very edge of Equestria, there grows an exquisite magic flower. Pick the flower as it drops its petals at sunset. Then you can make a magical soothing elixir to cure the blue flu.
411003 I suppose you have a good reason you didn't bother to get this flower as soon as you realized you were sick?
4110db Well, I couldn't travel that far in my condition. By the time I got there, I'd be too weak to even attempt to retrieve the flower.
411003 So where exactly are Cadance and I headed?
4110db Well, [clears throat] you'll want to head north, turn left, th— Oh... You know, it'd be much easier if I took you there myself.
411198 I thought you were in no condition to travel.
4110db I'm not. We'll need to make some arrangements. [chuckles]
411198 [straining]
411003 Doing okay there?
411198 To be honest, I'm a little out of practice when it comes to flying.
4110db Well, then lucky for you. We're here.
411000 [thud]
4110db It's just at the top of that hill.
411003 I'm really sorry about this. All I wanted was to have some peaceful quality time together.
411198 I know, I was looking forward to it too.
411000 [eagle screeches]
411003 This is the top. But where is that flower? Oh. Come on, if we hurry, we can still have some time together.
411000 [cracking]
411198 One... last... pull!
41119d [straining]
411003 Phew! Let's get Discord and this flower back home, then all our problems are solved-
411198 What in Equestria?!
411223 [roars]
41119d [screaming]
411223 [roars]
411198 Twilight! Help!
411003 Get your coils off my sister-in-law!
411000 [thud]
411223 [roars]
411003 [yelps]
411198 [gasps]
411003 [screams]
411198 Let go of my sister-in-law!
411003 Thanks!
411198 Don't thank me yet!
411223 [roars]
411003 [gasps]
411000 [magic zapping, Tatzlwurm roaring]
411003 Just... a little... more!
411223 [roars] [Wilhelm scream]
411198 And for good measure...!
411000 [thud, crashing]
411003 [panting] Are you okay?
411198 [panting] Yes. Better than okay actually.
411003 Then let's get Discord back to Ponyville, make that elixir, and finally get a chance to spend some quality time together.
4110db To the ends of Equestria! To face such great danger! And she did it for me! She did it all for me, for me, for me! [laughs]
411003 You... were... faking?!
4110db I was! But I had a very good reason.
411003 We're listening.
4110db Well, I was in my thinking tree – that's where I do most of my really deep thinking – I was there, and I said to myself, I said, "Discord, your friend Twilight says that she's your pal, but she never writes and she never pops in for a visit."
411003 I don't even know where you li-
4110db "Now that she's a princess, maybe she's decided that she's too good for you."
411003 I have never considered myself t-
4110db But how was I supposed to know for sure that I'm truly still friends with one of the most important ponies around?
411003 I'm not more-
4110db By seeing if you would go to the ends of Equestria for me, of course. Which you did, literally. Congratulations, Twilight, you passed my friendship test!
411000 [clink]
4110db Why the angry eyes? You love passing tests. It's not because my little exam put a damper on your visit with Princess Cadance, is it? Made it so that there was no time for you two to focus on your friendship?
411198 You didn't put a damper on our visit at all.
411003 Twilight Sparkle:
411003 He didn't?!
4110db Discord:
4110db I didn't?!
411198 Spending the day at the Star Swirl the Bearded exhibit would've been more relaxing, but to be honest, relaxation is the last thing I need.
411003 It is?
411198 Don't get me wrong. Life in the Crystal Empire is wonderful, but it's become a little... predictable. I enjoy a little excitement now and then. Getting to face all these challenges today was just what I needed. And facing them with you just made me realize even more how lucky I am to have somepony like you as a friend. We may not see each other very often, but I know you'll always be there when I need you. Just like she was there for you, Discord.
4110db Yes, she's a real sweetheart. We're all so lucky to have her in our lives.
411000 [rumbling]
411223 [roars]
4110db What in the world?!
411223 [spits]
411000 [popping]
411003 I think it's pretty clear that my visit with Cadance didn't go quite the way I expected. But in the end, I realized that when you're with a good friend, even the most chaotic day can end up being a great experience that brings you closer. Wouldn't you agree, Discord?
4110db [snorts] Yes, Twilight.
411008 I don't wanna go sayin' you got what you deserved...
41100d Well, I have no trouble saying it. You got what you deserved!
41100e Now, now, he's learned his lesson. Isn't that right, my little patient?
4110db I'm so glad that you're back from your trip, Fluttershy. Just your presence here is making me feel so much better. I was just wondering, could I trouble you for just one more thing?
411003 No!
4110db What? I was simply going to ask for a teeny, tiny glass of water.
411000 [credits]
412000 [cheering]
412224 Well, Boneless. Looks like our work here is done.
412000 [sloop]
412224 Yep, those ponies never partied so hard. Thanks to me - Cheese. Cheese Sandwich.
412000 [tingling, accordion playing]
412224 Woo-hoo-hoo! That was a doozy! Well, Boneless. Looks like our next party is gonna be in... Ponyville.
412000 [theme song]
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 Every single day there's something new you can plan for
412007 Every single day there's something wonderful to do
412007 But nothing makes me happy like a day that I can say
412007 Today I planned a party, and it's just for you!
412225 How's it going today, Pinkie?
412007 Great, thanks! Got any streamers today?
412225 [chuckles] You betcha! Big party planned?
412007 Don't you know it!
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 Don't have much time to gather all the things I need
412007 If I'm really gonna make this party fly
412007 For today's another day that all of Ponyville will say
4120ec [Crowd]
4120ec There goes the super party pony Pinkie Pie!
412000 [Mr and Mrs Cake]
412000 She planned our first foal shower where we played all sorts of games
412000 Having so much fun as we chose Pound and Pumpkin's names
41205c [Diamond Tiara]
41205c She planned my cute-ceañera my dad made me, I won't lie
41205c I demanded all the best, I suppose she passed the test
41205c Sure it was pretty good all thanks to Pinkie Pie
412007 Thanks, I guess?
412226 What color paints do you need?
412007 I'm gonna need the full rainbow!
412226 A paintbrush too?
412007 Yes, if you please!
412227 And what from me?
412007 Your biggest banner! This party's gonna be the best!
412227 Haha I don't doubt it!
4120ec [Crowd]
4120ec Every single day there's something new we can plan for
4120ec Every single day there's something wonderful to try
4120ec But nothing makes us happy like a day that we can say
4120ec Today there'll be a party planned by Pinkie Pie!
41200d I don't know how she does it.
412003 Wow, look at her go!
412008 Oh, boy! This is gonna be good!
41200e Go, Pinkie, go!
4120ec [Crowd]
4120ec There's no other pony like her, no pony that could be
4120ec As great! (As great!) As fun! (As fun!)
4120ec As our super party pony Pinkie!
412007 Ooh, I am so, so, SO excited because today I'm planning the birthday bash of... Rainbow Dash!
41200c Yeah!
412007 Rainbow Dash.
41200c Yes, Pinkie?
412007 You realize that, by enlisting me as your party planner, I guarantee that this is going to be the funnest, most fantabulous, superbial party in Ponyville?
41200c Uh...yeah? I guess.
412007 No guesses! Parties are no picnic.
41200e Oh, I like a nice picnic party.
412007 [growls]
41200e Oh!
412007 Parties. Are. Serious! And you have my certified Pinkie Party Promise that you will have the best birthday party ever!
41200c Okay.
412007 Great! Now, who's ready to join this super duper party pony to plan this super duper pa-rty?
412224 I am.
412000 [gasps]
412224 [blows party horn]
412007 Who are you, stranger?
412224 Name's Cheese Sandwich. I plan parties.
412007 What an amazing coincidence! I'm Pinkie Pie, and I'm planning a party!
412224 Oh, it's no coincidence, my little pony. My cheesy sense was a-tingling, telling me a party was in the works.
412007 A cheesy sense? Ah! Double amazing! I have a Pinkie Sense!
412224 Yes. I sensed you did. And I happen to be the premiere party planner in all of Equestria. If there's a party in need, there I'll be. Be it wingding, hoedown, hootenanny, or shindig, I'm your pony.
412007 A pair of party pony planners in Ponyville?! What can be more perfect?!
41200c I'll tell you what -- making this party epic! 'Cause this isn't just any birthday. It's also the anniversary of when I moved to Ponyville!
41200d Good heavens, Rainbow Dash. It's your "birth-iversary"!
41200c Exactly! So what do you say, party planners?
412007 Oh, I think we can do it!
412224 Oh, I don't think so.
412030 [gasps]
412224 I know so! After all...
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 The super-duper party pony–that pony is me
412224 I always knew that was the kind of pony I would be
412007 Me too!
412224 Come on, ponies! Who here likes to party? Ha-ha! You do! I can tell!
412224 When I was but a little colt, I just wanted to play
412007 Like me!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 But everypony told me, "Cheese, that fun just wastes the day"
412007 As if!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 But when I threw a party and I busted out some moves
412007 Uh-huh!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 The ponies finally saw the light and got into the groove
412007 You know it!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 The super-duper party pony–that pony is me
412007 And me!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese!
412007 Uh, Pinkie?
412224 Hey, good-lookin', want some mayonnaise?
412224 My parties are all off the hook
412224 I never plan them by the book
412224 I start out fun, then whoopsie-daisy
412224 Everybody just gets crazy!
412224 Bored of snacks made by your mom?
412224 How about a giant party bomb?
412224 Huge piñatas filled with cake
412224 Or dive into my fruit punch lake!
4120a4 Geronimo!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 The super-duper party pony–that pony is me
412224 You'll never meet another party pony quite like Cheese
412224 C'mon, kid, take it for a spin!
412228 Golly! Thanks, mister!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 Oh, when I throw a Cheese party, be sure to not be lame
412224 And miss my pie fights, wacky kites, and streamers in your mane
412224 Fizzy drinks, Hawaiian shirts, and brie fondue delight
412224 You know that with Cheese Sandwich, you'll be partying all night!
41200c C'mon, everypony! Let's party down with Cheese!
41200e You're really a certified party pony?
412224 That's right! That's my guarantee!
412224 The super-duper party pony–that pony is me-e-e-e-e
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 But what about the super party pony named Pinkie...?
412224 [indistinct] Thanks buddy! You're gonna love this party! Hey kid, have a streamer, on me!
41200c Yeah! Hah, now that's what I'm talking about! I'm so stoked you're here, Cheese Sandwich!
412008 Yeah. You sure did come on the right day.
41200d [sighs] Your party sounds simply divine.
412003 We're so lucky to have you here.
412224 Just doing my job, little fillies.
41200c I mean, Pinkie Pie's parties are fun and sweet and all, but now this party's gonna be--
412224 Epic?
41200c You said it! Oh, yeah!
412224 Feels gouda!
41200c Uh, heh, no offense, Pinkie.
412007 Uh, n-none taken. [squee]
41200c My birth-iversary's already looking way cooler! You are my kind of party pony, Cheese Sandwich.
412224 [chuckles] You got that right, Rainbow Dash. All right, party ponies, I've got some planning to do!
412000 [cheering]
412003 Pinkie! Aren't you gonna help Cheese Sandwich plan the party?
412007 That's okay. [chuckles nervously] He obviously has what it takes to do it all by himself. Heh.
412003 Really?
412007 Yes, indeedy! [chuckles nervously] After all, if Cheese really is the super duperiest partying-est pony of them all, maybe that means... I'm... not.
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 For all my life, all I've wanted to do
412007 Was make my friends want to smile true
412007 But maybe I was wrong
412007 And Pinkie Pie shouldn't plan parties at all
412007 I'll try to get up on my hooves
412007 And try a different task
412007 I'll find something new to do
412007 There's gotta be more to me than planning a party or two
412007 I put away my party cannon, I deflated all my balloons
412007 The bubbles all burst, now what is next for you?
412007 For you...
412007 Oh, I remember this one - my first party ever. My whole family was there. And that's Twilight's welcome-to-Ponyville party. She didn't even expect that one. [giggles] Oh, look at Gummy! He just looks so excited for this birthday party! Hmm. Shining Armor and Cadance's wedding sure was special, especially once I got a hold of the music.
412007 Oh, look at those happy faces
412007 All the parties that I had thrown
412007 I made them laugh, had such a blast
412007 A smile that's all their own
412007 They loved seeing me, the real Pinkie
412007 Show them the time of their life like they've never known
412007 Like they've never kno-o-own
412007 I've got to get back out there, have to show them that I've tried
412007 For there's only one great party pony -- that is Pinkie Pie
412007 Won't let Cheese Sandwich beat me, won't let him get me down
412007 For I am Pinkie, the bestest party pony around!
41200d I must say I marvel at your superior party planning expertise, Cheese Sandwich. [giggles]
412008 Well, they don't call him the super duper party planner for nothin'.
412007 That's it! This pony has gotta get her title back! And I know just what to do!
41200c Totally awesome!
412008 Huh. Best I've ever seen.
412003 I can't believe it!
412000 [ponies awing]
412007 Freeze, Cheese! I challenge you... to a goof off!
412000 [ponies gasp]
41200e Oh, no! Not a goof off!
412008 [whispering] What's a goof off?
41200e I have no idea, hehe.
412224 This Cheese has stood alone a long time, Pinkie Pie. You think you can out-goof me?
412007 Oh, I don't think so. I know so! And the stakes are high, Cheese Sandwich. Whoever wins will be dubbed the ultimate super duper party pony and headline the Rainbow Dash birth-iversary bash!
412003 And the loser?
412007 Doesn't!
41200c [gasps]
41211a [gasps]
412007 So, are you in, Cheese? Or are you... boneless?
412224 Nopony calls me boneless. Right, Boneless?
412007 Then the goof off is on for high noon!
412003 Um, Pinkie? It's already 3 o'clock.
412007 Oh. Oh, well then. Make it 3 -10 to goof off!
412000 [eagle screeches]
412000 [clock ticks]
412000 [spurs jangling]
412000 [squeaking]
412007 [blows party horn]
412003 All right, everypony. According to my official goof off rulebook...
41200c She actually has a goof off rulebook?
412005 Are you kidding? Twilight can find a rulebook for everything!
41215b Shhh.
412003 The two competitors have free range to goof about -- be it by singing, dancing, playing, prancing, joking, or performing -- to make the judge chortle, chuckle, giggle, guffaw, hoot and holler, whoop it up, and party down.
412000 [tuba sounds]
412003 The funnier, sillier, wilder, and goofier, the better. Rainbow Dash, since the winner will be headlining your party, you are the judge.
41200c Heh. Big tense competition on my birth-iversary. What could be better?
412003 Cheese Sandwich, Pinkie Pie, are you ready?
412007 I was born ready!
412224 I was ready before I was born!
412003 Then... Let the goofing begin!
412000 [bouncing, squeaking]
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 It's your birthday party, a very special day
412007 I've got a song, it won't take long, I just wanted to say
412007 Happy, happy, happy, happy
412007 Happy, happy, happy, happy
412007 Happy, happy, happy, happy birthday to you!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 If you wanna be the life of the party
412224 But you're feeling just a little uptight
412224 Call the doctor, beg and plead
412224 Doctor, tell me what I need
412224 Try to put a little cheese in your knees!
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 Bubbles and balloons, bubbles and balloons
412007 What's a birthday party without bubbles and balloons?
412007 Star-shaped or trapezoid, look what I can do
412007 Only Pinkie Pie can make a bubble shaped like you!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 Just let yourself go floppy, for now this is your chance
412224 Pretend you have no bones and do the rubber chicken dance!
412224 Hit it, Boneless!
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 Cooler than a rubber chicken and tastier than cake
412007 Come on, you, let's party down and do the Gummy shake!
412007 Hit it, Gummy! Uh-huh! You know it! Shake it!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 'Cause I like to make you smile, smile, smile
412224 Yes I do
412224 It fills my heart with sunshine all the while
412224 Yes it does
412224 'Cause all I really need's a smile, smile, smile
412224 From these happy friends of mine
412007 That's my song!
412224 What do you mean? I have no idea what you're talking about.
412007 THAT'S IT!
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 Roll out the party cannon
412007 When you hear the party cannon song
412007 Ka-BOOM!
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 Why should you compromise? Try this one on for size
412224 'Cause nothing quite says cheer like the ringing in your ear
412224 Of the cheese supreme cannonball surprise!
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 ¡Dale, dale, dale
412007 No pierdas el tino!
412007 Porque si lo pierdes
412007 ¡Pierdes el camino!
412007 [gasps] Rainbow's not having the best party ever! I... I broke the Pinkie Party Promise! Stop! The goof off is off!
412000 [ponies murmuring confused]
41200c But I haven't named a winner.
412007 You don't have to. I forfeit. Which means... Cheese Sandwich wins.
412224 [laughs] [sighs] ...I do?
412007 Yes. You get to headline Rainbow Dash's party.
412003 But, what about you, Pinkie?
412007 I... [sniffles] I don't.
41200c Pinkie, wait! I'm sorry I got all swept away by Cheese Sandwich.
412003 We all are.
412025 [general agreement]
412005 [sighs] Sorry, Pinkie.
412007 No. I'm sorry I let my pride get in the way of you having the best birth-iversary ever. Cheese Sandwich really is a super duper party planner, and he'll be a terrific headliner. I should've been a big enough pony to admit that and let you have your day.
41200c But don't you get it? You're both super duper party ponies. Sure, Cheese Sandwich is a great guest party pony, but you're Ponyville's permanent party pony. Nopony could ever take your place, and we could never have a party without you.
412224 Rainbow Dash is right. I never meant to take your place in Ponyville. I just wanted to show you what a great party pony I am, Pinkie.
412007 Why me?
412224 Well...
412224 [Cheese Sandwich]
412224 I fear I told a little fib about my pony past
412224 I hope that when you hear the truth, you will not be aghast
412224 I wasn't quite the super party pony like I claimed
412224 The fact is that I was so shy, nopony knew my name
412224 I stumbled into Ponyville one afternoon by chance
412224 And found the biggest ever celebration party dance
412224 Everything was perfect, cheer was filling up the place
412224 And I saw that everypony had a smile upon their face
412224 I vowed that day to change my life, the past I did set free
412224 For now Cheese Sandwich was a party pony full of glee
412224 A super duper party pony -- that's what I became
412224 I traveled all Equestria, and all did know my name
412224 But that never would have happened on my own, I'll tell you why
412224 For the one who threw that party, it was you, Pinkie Pie
412007 Me?
412224 Yes!
412007 Hah, really?!
412224 Really!
412007 So I was the pony that threw the awesomely spectacular party that inspired you to become an awesome spectacular party thrower?
412224 Swear on Camembert!
412000 [music warps down]
41200c Enough with the warm fuzzy stuff, you two. It's my birth-iversary, and you gotta throw me a bash!
412007 Yeah!
412224 Let's go!
412000 [Pinkie Pie and Cheese Sandwich]
412000 Super duper party ponies -- that is me and you
412000 A party thrown by one is good, but not as great as two
412000 Come on and let's join forces, have twice the expertise
412000 Now let's all go to the party planned by Pinkie Pie and Cheese!
412000 [dance music, rattling, cheering, splash, explosion with kazoos]
412224 All right, everypony! We are here to celebrate the birthday...
412007 ...and anniversary...
412229 ...of Rainbow Dash!
41200c Hey, everypony! Who's ready to get their party on?! Hit it!
412007 [Pinkie Pie]
412007 Get your hooves up, party's starting out right now
412007 Everypony, everypony get down
412007 Time to make a wish, better make it right now
412007 It's been a year and today is your birthday party
412007 Make a wish, it's your birthday
412007 Make a wish, it's your birthday party
412007 Make a wish, it's your birthday
412007 Make a wish, it's your birthday party
41200c Cheese Sandwich! Oh, I gotta tell ya, you and Pinkie have totally made this the best birthday/anniversary super combo ever! Hah, it's totally--
412224 Epic?
41200c Yeah, it is!
412224 That's all I needed to hear, little filly. Just a little memento of my visit.
412007 You're giving me your special rubber chicken friend?
412224 Oh, he's not the only one. Well, Boneless Two, another job well done. But it's time we mosey along. Another town, another party.
412007 I never did get that pony's name.
4120d4 Cheese Sandwich!
412007 [giggles] Oh, yeah!
412000 [Instrumental version of The Goof Off plays over credits]
41300c Wow! I can't believe how many ponies showed up!
413007 I can! I mean, finding out who the Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies is is a pretty big deal!
413003 I didn't know Granny Smith was on the selection committee.
413008 Of course she is. Ponyville Days celebrates the founding of Ponyville, and she was right there.
413007 I'm glad the committee didn't automatically pick me so everypony gets a chance to see how great being me actually is! Even though the festival's basically a party and the pony of ceremonies gets to organize the whole thing! So it'd totally make sense if they did pick me.
41300f Shhh!
413000 [microphone feedback]
413010 Citizens of Ponyville, this year's applicants were all exceptional, but there can only be one Ponyville Days pony of ceremonies. And that pony is...
413007 [long inhalation]
413010 Rarity!
41300f [cheering]
413008 Whoo-ee! All right, Rarity!
41300c Yeah! Whoo-oo-oo! [laughs]
413003 Congratulations, Rarity! Do you know what you're gonna do?
413005 [straining noises]
41300d Oh, I might have a few ideas.
413000 [theme song]
413007 I'm so excited for the festival, I can hardly stand up straight!
413003 Me too. I'm glad Rarity was picked. I know she'll add a touch of elegance to the whole thing!
413008 Probably more than a touch!
413000 [lights buzzing on]
413000 [cranking]
413005 [clears throat] [reading] This year's Ponyville Days festival, designed by Rarity, will feature various high-class events such as... a silent cider auction and tasting...
41306c Ooooh!
413005 ...A Ponyville gala in town square...
41306c Ahhhh!
413005 ...And, of course, a Ponyville fashion show.
41306c Ooooh!
413005 This year's Ponyville Days festival pony of ceremonies creates shimmering couture of her own design.
41300d And the theme is... "Small Town Chic"!
413003 Wow, Rarity. You really have put a lot of effort into this.
413008 I'll say.
41300e Oh, I think it's going to be magical.
41300d [gasps] Do you really think so?
413007 Are you kidding? I can't wait!
41300d Oh, that's such a relief. But of course, I couldn't possibly do it all on my own. The festival is in three days!
41300c Pinkie Pie and I can hang lights and decorations in the town square!
413008 And I can get Sweet Apple Acres all ready for the cider tastin'.
41300d Oh, that's just perfect! And now, Twilight, if you and Fluttershy wouldn't mind helping with the fashion show...
413003 Of course!
41300e I'd be honored.
41300d I can focus on the thing I'm worried about most of all.
41306c What?
41300d Creating a Ponyville Days festival fantastic enough to impress... Trenderhoof!
413000 [beat]
413008 Uh, who's Trenderhoof?
41300d What?! How can you not know who Trenderhoof is? Trenderhoof is only the most amazing, handsomest travel writer to have ever traveled or written! Before Las Pegasus became an Equestria travel destination, he wrote about it! Before the culinary revolution in Trottingham, he discovered it! He knows what's going to be hot even before it's tepid! [giggles]
413003 Sounds like somepony has a little bit of a crush.
41300d Oh, Twilight, "crush" doesn't even begin to describe it. He's practically divine. I can't believe he's coming! [tittering]
413000 [train engine noises]
41300d Thank you ever so much for joining me, Twilight. I don't think I could have met Trenderhoof on my own!
413003 It's no problem, but you shouldn't be nervous about meeting him.
413000 [ponies chattering]
41300d Is that him? Is he here? Twilight, is he there?
413003 Uhh... I'm not sure.
41300d You don't suppose he's decided not to come? Twilight, I don't see him! What if he doesn't arrive? The whole festival will be a disaster! Twilight, where is he?!
413000 [beat]
41300d [clears throat] Sorry.
413003 Rarity, you have to get a hold of yourself. I mean, you haven't even met him yet!
413000 [bubbles popping]
41300d [gasps]
413003 What's wrong?
41300d Shh! [hushed, quickly] It's him, it's him, is it him? Is it him? It's him, he's here, he's here!
413003 Well, go up and talk to him!
41300d [unintelligible screeching] I can't! [nervous laughing] Uh, hi– [clears throat] Hello, Mr Trenderhoof. I am Rarity, and I have been chosen as pony of ceremonies for the Ponyville Days festival. [nervous laughing]
41322a Please, call me 'Trend'.
413000 [thud]
41300d And over here will be the climax of the festival, the Ponyville Days gala! Music, dancing! [laughs nervously] And of course a locally sourced menu of delicious treats.
41322a Reminds me of the "Spring Fling meets Manehattan Wedding" I wrote about in Gallop & Prance.
41300d Exactly! I, I can't even describe how much your work has influenced me!
41300d And finally, Sweet Apple Acres. Ponyville's core, heh-heh, so to speak, where our quaint little hamlet began.
41322a Oh, breathtaking! I've heard about it of course, but to see it in vérité, to stand on the soil of a working farm... you can really feel the authenticity.
41300d Oh, yes, uh, they, they really do grow apples here.
41322a Thank you, Rarity. Thank you for bringing me here. This farm is truly something special.
41300d Oh, I had planned to transform it into an elegant country inn for the festival... but now I see just how special it is au naturel.
41322a Au naturel indeed.
413000 [bubbles popping]
41322a Who... is... that?
413008 [panting]
41300d Who? Applejack? Ahem! Why are you staring at her like that?
41322a I've seen a lot in my travels, but I've never beheld such beauty. Applejack... the pony of my dreams...
413005 Rarity? Rarity! Hello?
41300d [muffled sobbing]
413005 I brought my cider-tasting cup. Are you ready to go try the samples?
41300d [sobbing throughout] What's the point?!
413005 Rarity, what's wrong?
41300d [quietly] Nothing.
413005 Is it something I said?
41300d [quietly] He doesn't like me.
413005 What?
41300d [quietly] He doesn't like me.
413005 Rarity, I can't hear what you're—
41300d He doesn't like me because he has a crush on Applejack, even though I've had a crush on him ever since the beginning of time, and it's not fair!
413005 Trenderhoof doesn't like you? That's ridiculous!
41300d Oh, Spike, how could you ever know what it's like to be totally obsessed with a pony only to find out they're obsessed with somepony else?
413000 [beat]
41300d I mean, what could Applejack possibly have that I don't?!
413005 I 'unno.
41300d Hmm...
41322a You know, I have such respect for the work ethic of Earth ponies.
413008 Uh, gee, thanks. Granny Smith always said, "Pick an apple a day and keep trouble away."
41322a How many varieties of apples do you think there are?
413008 Uh, on the farm or in all of Equestria? 'Cause—
41322a I once had an apple so rare, they thought it was extinct. I ate four of them. [bites]
413000 [splash]
413008 Is that a fact?
41322a That's my thing. I take the mundane, the simple, the unappreciated, and I make it relatable.
413008 Well, I hope you can relate to Ponyville.
41322a Me too. But enough about me. I wanna know about you! What do apples mean to Applejack?
413008 Look, I'm glad you're interested in Ponyville 'n' all, but I'm kinda busy with my chores. And if I can't get 'em done, there won't be a Ponyville Days festival for you to write about.
41300d Well, that will never do!
413008 Rarity, what are you wearin'?
41300d What, this old thing?
413008 Aren't you too busy plannin' the festival to keep makin' new outfits for it?
41300d I am. But the thought of hauling apples inspired me, and I just couldn't stop myself!
413008 Really?
41300d If there's one thing I love, it's hauling apples!
41322a [dreamily] I'm growing fond of it myself.
413008 [under her breath] Maybe you two should try it sometime.
41322a I'm feeling a tad inspired.
41322a Without farm life, there'd be such disparity
41322a These thoughts I think with great clarity
41322a Apples high to the sky
41322a She's the one of my eye
41322a That fruit-hauling pony named... Applejack!
41300d [mule bray]
413000 [bubble shattering]
413005 Rarity, why do you want to plow a field?
41300d Is it me, or could this use a splash of color? And maybe a wash!
413005 Don't we need to check on the gala decorations?
41300d Yes, yes, of course, but Trend obviously has a thing for farm life. If I can't convince him that I'm just as much of a farm hoof as Applejack, I'll never get him interested in the festival.
413005 The festival. Right.
41300d And I do appreciate your help ever so much. I couldn't do a thing without you, Spikey-poo.
413005 Well, that's what friends are for!
41300d Right, so. [whips reins] Come on! [grunts] Farm... thing! [sighs] Oh, how does Applejack do it?
413008 Well, it would help if the harness was on right. What are you doin'?
41300d I am simply lending a hoof with the chores, which I love doing ever so much.
413008 Well if you're still interested after the festival I can teach you all about it. But right now, I need to get the plowin' done, if you don't mind.
41300d Not at all. Ugh! Oh!
413005 She makes it look so easy.
41322a [dreamily] I know. Isn't she fantastic?
413008 [grunts]
41322a [clapping]
41300d I really don't see what the fuss is all about.
413000 [tapping]
413008 Now, Rarity, you be careful. If you don't get the buckin' just right, you could sprain a hoof.
41300d I am perfectly familiar with the apple-bucking process, thank you very much. But while you seem to rely on raw power, I believe a certain amount of style is required. It's really more of a dance, if you ask me. [happy 'hm'ing noises] Et voilà!
413008 Well, your way is definitely long on style.
41300d Thank you.
413008 Now, if you'll all excuse me, I have some more chores to do. Inside!
413000 [chickens clucking]
41322a Rarity, can I ask you something?
41300d Oh, why, Trend, you can ask me anything.
41322a I've been meaning to ask for a while, and frankly I'm sort of embarrassed. Rarity... do you think... Applejack would be my date for the festival?
41300d Why don't you go ask her yourself?! Hmph!
413000 [chickens clucking]
413000 [door slamming]
413008 Whew! Well, that was close.
41300d If you've come to apologize, there's really no need.
413008 What are you talkin' about?
41300d Let's dispense with the charade, shall we?
413008 Listen, I know you really want Trend to like you—
41300d And he does! Despite somepony's best efforts!
413008 I swear I don't know why he's payin' so much attention to me. And I don't know anypony who's that interested in farmin'. Not even me!
41300d Well, maybe it's time Trend met a real country pony.
413008 Shouldn't you be workin' on the festival instead of comin' up with new ways to impress Trend?
41300d Oh, I'm sure you'd love that. Well, I have a new vision for the festival, [in country accent] and it's gonna be more country than the whole Apple family put together!
41300e Um, isn't it a little late to be changing the theme?
413000 [door closes]
413003 Applejack, what's going on?
413008 I'm too scared to guess.
413000 [lights buzz]
41300d [country accent] Firstly, I just want to thank you all for comin', and second, I know y'all will all adore my new festival theme!
413005 [playing banjo]
41300d [country accent] "Simple Ways"!
413008 [laughing]
41300d [country accent throughout] Well? What's so funny?
413008 Rarity, that is the silliest getup I have ever seen!
41300e It is a little funny.
41300d Fun-nay?
413003 [laughing] Rarity, you aren't serious, are you?
41300d [normal voice] Well of course I'm serious– [clears throat] [back in country accent] Why wouldn't I be?
413008 Because you would never dress like that. You like fashion and high society and fancy things.
41300d And I can like plowin' fields and haulin' apples just as much.
413008 But you don't!
41300d How do you know what I like?
413008 Because I know you.
41300d Wail, maybe you don't know me as well as you thank.
413008 And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Trenderhoof seemed so interested in country life, too?
41300d I don't know what you're gittin' at!
413008 Well then, I guess I'll just have to show you!
41300d Be my guest! Now, if you all will excuse me, I have a hootenanny of a festival to put on.
413008 [growls]
41300d [country accent throughout] Now, to be a model in the Simple Ways fashion show, you might think "simple" means "less is more". Well, that just ain't so. If you want to be real simple, more is more. Now, y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that. [to Spike] Who's our next model for the fashion show?
413005 Um... Apple... Jewel?
41300d Who the hay is that?
413000 [tango music]
41300d Is this some kind of joke?
413008 [upper-class accent throughout] Why, Rarity, whatever would make you think I was joking?
41300d [normal voice] Because you would never wear an ensemble like that. You like plowing fields and hauling apples—
413008 And I can like fashion just as much.
41300d [back in country accent] But you don't!
413008 Well, maybe you do not know me as well as you think.
41300d Fine. But I got a whole festival to plan, so if you're goin' to start modelin', just get on with it!
413008 Life is a festival, and you should celebrate it by looking just like me! Because I'm a trend-setting fashionista!
413000 [camera snapping]
41300d [normal voice] You're a trend-setting fashionista?! Why, that is the most ridiculous thing I've ever– I mean... [back in country accent] good for you. I, on the other hoof, couldn't care less how I look, long as I get the chores done. [mule bray]
413008 Oh, is that so?
41300d Yes, indeedy-doodle!
413008 [gasp] Not me! My mane needs to be perfectly coiffed at all times.
41300d Well, my mane is full of dust and split ends.
413008 My hooves are so polished, you can see your reflection in them.
41300d My hooves are cracked and dry from working in the fields!
413008 I'm so fashion-forward.
41300d I wear droopy drawers!
413008 I smell like rosebuds.
41300d I love being covered in mud!
413000 [splash]
413000 [splat]
41300d [normal voice] Goodness! Your couture! Ooh, it's bad. Will somepony bring me a towel to wipe this repulsive filth from my hooves?!
413008 [normal voice] There's the Rarity I know!
41300d Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry I said all those things. You're a true friend who probably knows me better than I know myself. I don't know what I was thinking wearing this ridiculous outfit.
413008 I kinda know how you feel.
41300d Oh, but you were just trying to help me see how silly I was being. And you were right. [sighs] Besides, that gown looks just gorgeous on you. I wish I hadn't ruined it.
413008 Thanks! It's nice, ain't it?
41300d It's magnificent! Wherever did you get it?
413008 Oh, it's, uh, one of yours.
41300d I'll need three gallons of boiling water and one ounce of detergent, stat!
41322a [clears throat] I'm moving to Ponyville! Being the most interesting pony in Equestria is exhausting. I want to leave my exotic, exciting life behind and live on a farm!
413043 What?!
413008 Well, that's real nice, but I sure hope you weren't thinkin' of Sweet Apple Acres.
41322a Oh.
413008 Uh, look, you're a fine pony, but, uh, well, I'm, uh...
41300d I think what Applejack is trying to say is that there's something unappealing about a pony who'd change themselves so much just to impress somepony else. If somepony doesn't like you for who you are, it's their loss.
41322a Well, this is awkward.
41300d Not at all. In fact, I think I know just how you feel.
413008 What do you think, Rarity? Is it too late to go back to "Small Town Chic"?
41300d Not if I can help it!
413000 [ponies talking in background]
41300d Organizing the Ponyville Days celebration was one of the hardest things I've ever done. But I learned an important lesson. Real friends will like you for who you are, and changing yourself to impress them is no way to make new ones. And when you're as fabulous as I am, it's practically a crime!
413000 [credits]
414000 [birds tweeting]
41400e Oh, good morning, little friends. Your singing is oh-so pretty.
414000 [birds tweeting]
41400e Yes, it is a very beautiful day today. Certainly something worth singing about.
41400e There's music in the treetops
41400e And there's music in the vale
41400e And all around the music fills the sky
41400e There's music by the river
41400e And there's music in the grass
41400e And the music makes your heart soar in reply
414000 [vocalizing]
41422b [cheering]
41400e Oh, thank you so much. [giggles] You're too kind.
414007 Wow!
41400e Oh... you... um... you didn't hear me... um...
414007 Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?!
41400c Uh, yeah, we did!
41400e [gasp, whimper]
414000 [theme song]
414003 Wow, I've never heard you sing a solo like that before!
414008 It was like a little slice of heaven.
414007 With ice cream on top!
41400d Fluttershy, I cannot believe your spectacular voice isn't part of the Pony Tones quartet!
41400e Um, well, I—
41400d Especially since you're having us perform for your Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser tomorrow night!
41400e Well, you see, I—
41400d This simply must be rectified. You must share that stunning voice at the event!
414007 Yeah! It'll be so amazing! You'll be there on stage, basking in the hooflights! The center of attention! A shining star! Everypony staring at you, judging you, jealously noting how they could be way better than you! Why wasn't it them? Why wasn't it them? And then, when you choke, they'll turn on you, becoming a seething, angry mob, and you'll be horribly humiliated, never able to show your face in Ponyville again!
41400d Pinkie Pie!
414000 [thwack]
41400d Don't be ridiculous!
414007 Aw, but I'm so good at it!
41400d [sighs] Come, Fluttershy, you will join the group, making the Pony Tones quartet the Pony Tones quintet!
41400e No.
41400d Pardon me?
41400e I love the Pony Tones, I'm one of their biggest fans, but I do not want to perform with them.
414003 Why not, Fluttershy?
41400e Well, you see... I... I have... um... I... I have...
41400c Spit it out!
41400e I have... stage fright.
414007 [gasps] Is it contagious?!
414003 Stage fright isn't a disease, Pinkie. It just means that Fluttershy is scared to perform in front of everypony.
41400e I'm very thankful the Pony Tones are singing at the Pet Center fundraiser, and I'm really looking forward to the performance, but I'll be watching safely from the audience.
41400d [sighs] Well... I think it's a terrible waste of an exquisite talent, but I understand that you're not comfortable.
41400e Thank you. Oh! Angel's right. We'd better get going. There's a lot of work to do before tomorrow's event.
41400d [clears throat] Alright, Pony Tones, let's run through that again! [blows pitch pipe]
414026 [Big McIntosh]
414026 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da
414026 Dum, bum, bum-ba-da ah
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)
414026 [Big McIntosh]
414026 Everypony's sayin' you should learn to express your voice
414026 But if talk doesn't seem like it's the answer
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Luckily you have a choice
414000 When you find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400d (Oh, you)
41400d Find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400e [sighs]
414005 Woo-hoo, yeah! Rarity, you were awesome!
41400d Uh, thank you, Spike, but this is an ensemble.
414005 Eh, the rest of you were pretty good too.
41400e Oh, I thought you were all amazing, Pony Tones!
41422c Thanks, Fluttershy!
41400d Now, Pony Tones, I want you all to rest your voices for the remainder of the day. We'll do a final run-through tomorrow before the big event, alright?
414026 Eeyup.
41422c Sounds great!
41400e Oh, Rarity, the Pony Tones are really gonna make the Ponyville Pet Center fundraiser so special. Thank you so much for helping me help the animals.
41400d Oh, yes. It is wonderful when a plan comes together without any sort of drama, isn't it?
41400e Mm-hmm. [giggles]
414000 [owl hoots]
414000 [rooster crows]
414000 [animals making various noises]
41422c Morning, Fluttershy!
41400e Good morning, Pony Tones!
41400d Actually, we're the Pony Tones minus one tone. Big Mac is inconveniently late.
414026 [wheezing and snorting]
41400d Well, there you are! Haven't I told you about punctuality? Nah-ah! I don't want to hear it! [blows pitch pipe]
414026 [gulps]
41400d Big Mac? Can you please start the song?
414026 [croaking] Nope.
41400d Big Mac! Did you lose your voice?
414026 [gulps] [croaking] Eeyup.
41422d [gasps]
41400e [gasps]
41400d Whatever did you do to cause this?
414026 [croaking] Well...
414008 [through microphone] Howdy, everypony, and welcome to the twelfth annual Ponyville turkey call!
414000 [ponies cheering]
414000 [turkey gobbles]
414008 Who will take the title this year? Will it be somepony new? Or will the turkey call champion of six years defend his title to make it lucky number seven?
414009 We'll find out if you stop your gabbin' and get on with the gobblin'!
414008 Alright, everypony! Let's talk turkey! Big Mac, you're up!
414026 [inhales]
41400d A...a...a turkey call? You lost your voice doing a... a turkey call?!
414007 Lost his voice and the title! [gobbles]
41400d Now we can't perform tonight!
41400e Wait, what? No! You have to perform! Otherwise, the fundraiser will be a disaster!
41400d Well, we cannot perform tonight with only three voices.
41400e Why not?
41400d It would take rearranging all the music, and we just don't have time. I'm sorry, Fluttershy, but I have no remedy for this situation.
41400e [gasps] Of course! A remedy! Follow me!
414047 Hmmm.
414026 [croaking] Ahhhh.
414047 Hmmm.
414026 [croaking] Ahhh—
414047 I can cure this pony that is hoarse, but it will take a longer course.
41400d Uh, come again?
414047 Mm. I can mix a brew that can work just right, but it cannot heal him by tonight.
41400e Oh, no! Ah! Where are we ever going to find a deep voice to replace Big Mac's?
414047 [chuckles]
41400d Pardon me, Zecora, but this is no laughing matter! We need a bass voice for the harmonies to work! Without it, the performance will be ruined!
414047 Please, forgive my strange elation, but I was not laughing at your situation.
41400d Then what?
414047 Remember when you pony folk stumbled into poison joke? Miss Fluttershy had an unusual change, deepening her vocal range.
41400e [from Bridle Gossip, deep male voice] I don't want to talk about it.
41400d Yes, yes! Your voice became really low, making it sound like...
41400e [gasps] Flutterguy!
414047 With these leaves I can mix a brew, creating the same effect on you.
41400d Zecora, that's fantastic!
41400e Yes! I'll do it! I'd do anything for the animals!
41400d Why, you'd even appear on stage!
41400e Oh. Except that. I just can't bring myself to sing on stage in front of everypony.
41400d What if you sang not in front of everypony?
41400e Huh?
41400d What if Big Mac was onstage, moving his lips while you're behind the curtains singing his part? It would be just like singing in your house! Nopony would know it was you!
41400e Even still, I just don't think I could sing in front of...
41400d You must! For the animals!
414040 [squeaking]
41400e Oh... okay then... [gulps] Mix it up!
41400d [hushed] Now, do it just like we practiced!
41400e [inhales]
4140ec [excited chatter]
41400d Good evening, citizens of Ponyville! I want to thank you all for coming out tonight and generously supporting the Ponyville Pet Center! Thanks to your kindness, pets are finding loving homes, and we're sure to meet our fundraising goal!
414003 Where's Fluttershy?
414008 Probably hidin'. You know how much that pony hates the spotlight.
41400d So, with no further ado, please welcome the Pony Tones!
4140ec [cheering]
41400d [blows pitch pipe]
41400e [inhales]
414026 [croaking] [inhales]
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da, ba-da (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)
414000 Bum, bum, bum-ba-da ah (Oh, ah-ah-ah-ah)
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Trot outside and you see the sunshine
414000 Something's in the air today
414000 Sky is clear and you're feelin' so fine
414000 Everything's gonna be a-okay
414000 [Toe-Tapper and Torch Song]
414000 If you listen carefully
414000 On every corner there's a rhythm playing
414000 [Toe-Tapper and Rarity]
414000 Then it happens suddenly
414000 The music takes you over and you'll
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400d (Oh, you)
41400d Find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Oh, o-o-oh
414000 Everypony's sayin' you should learn to express your voice
414000 But if talk doesn't seem like it's the answer
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Luckily you have a choice
414000 When you find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400d (Oh, you)
41400d Find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400d Got the music, got the music in you!
4140ec [cheering] Pony Tones! Pony Tones!
414003 Pony Tones! That was truly amazing!
414008 And you sounded better than ever, big brother!
414026 [chuckles]
414007 Fluttershy, you were on the wrong side of the curtain! You totally missed the show!
41400d Uh, just like a true professional, Fluttershy was backstage making sure everything ran smoothly! [hushed, to Fluttershy] And it was perfect.
41422e That was fantastic, Pony Tones!
41422f My new puppy and I thought it was super-duper crazy good!
41400d Why, thank you!
41422e And we were wondering if you would consider performing at my daughter Zipporwhill's cute-ceañera.
41422f Will you? Will you?
41400d We'd love to! When is it? Next week? Next month?
414230 Tomorrow!
41400d Oh, gracious, I'm terribly sorry, but that's much too last minute.
41422f Oh, no...
41422e Well... I understand.
41400e [deep male voice] Oh, Rarity, we can't disappoint that sweet little filly.
41400d [hushed] Are you sure you're up for it?
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 When you find you've got the music
414000 Got the music in you
414000 Find you've got the music
414000 Got the music in you
414000 Got the music, got the music in you!
4140f3 [cheering]
41422f Whoo, yeah, alright! We got the Pony Tones, we got the Pony Tones!
414010 Amazing, Pony Tones! And it would be even more amazing if you could perform at my ribbon-cutting ceremony tomorrow!
41400d Oh, Mayor, we would love to, but... [clears throat] would you excuse us for a second, Mayor?
414010 Certainly.
41400d [hushed] Don't worry, Fluttershy, you don't have to perform again.
41400e [deep male voice] But we wouldn't want to disappoint the Mayor.
41400d Well, then... Mayor? The Pony Tones will happily perform at your ceremony!
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 [harmonizing]
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Trot outside and see the sunshine
414000 Something's in the air today
414000 Sky is clear and you're feelin' so fine
414000 Everything's gonna be a-okay
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 [harmonizing]
41400e [deep male voice] We wouldn't want to disappoint the spa patrons.
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 If you listen carefully
414000 On every corner there's a rhythm playing
414000 Then it happens suddenly
414000 The music takes you over and you'll
41400e [deep male voice] We wouldn't want to disappoint the schoolponies.
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 When you find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400d (Oh, you)
41400d Find you've got the music
41400d (Fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiind the music)
41400d Got the music in you
41400d Got the music, got the music in you
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Find the music
414000 Deep down in your heart
414000 You can find it, oh ye-eah
414000 Got the music in you now
414000 Ye-e-eah, got the music in you
4140f3 [cheering]
41400d Fluttershy, we must talk to you. Big Mac's voice is all better!
414026 Eeyup.
41400d Now you can bathe in the poison joke antidote and sound like your lovely self again.
41400e [deep male voice] It's just... I didn't know that last performance was my last performance.
41400d Fluttershy, stop! Ohhh... [to Big McIntosh] would it be okay if Fluttershy sang for you one last time?
414026 Hmm. Eeyup.
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Hey, find it, oh why, you can find it
414000 In your heart, yeah, find the music, yeah
414000 It's in you right now! Oh, yeah!
414000 You can find the music!
414000 [crash, music fades]
414000 [Fluttershy (male voice)]
414000 Yeah, yeah, I love the music, ye—
414015 Fluttershy?!
4140ec [cheering]
414000 [cheering fades into eerie laughing]
41400e [deep male voice] [starts crying]
414008 Big Mac, you got some 'splainin' to do! [beat] Turkey call?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Trash your voice?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Zecora remedy?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Not quick enough?
414026 Nnope.
414008 Needed a deep voice?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Poison joke?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Flutterguy?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Better now?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 And that shy filly was livin' her dream in the shadows because she couldn't bring herself to come into the spotlight?
414026 Eeyup.
414008 Well, for corn's sake! Let's go!
414003 Fluttershy? You in here?
41400e [normal voice] Yes... I'm here.
414007 That was totally unbelievable! I mean, the curtain came up and there you were, singing in front of everypony! And you know, I don't think anypony was jealous, 'cause there certainly wasn't an angry mob! But it must have been horrible standing there on stage, all eyes glued directly on you! It's like you were living your own personal worst nightmare!
41400e [crying] It was.
414007 What? Too much?
41400e [crying]
414003 What Pinkie meant to say is that you were really great!
414007 Wait! Didn't I say that?
41400d Hardly!
414007 Whoops. You were great!
41400e [out of breath crying]
41400c You totally blew my mind!
414008 Incredible!
414007 Though, no offense... you kind of sounded like a dude.
41400e [crying]
414007 Uh, a great-sounding dude!
41400e Well, thank you all. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Because I'm never going to sing in front of anypony ever again.
414015 [gasps] [exclamations]
414007 Are you kidding me?!
41400d Can we please stop running?
41400e [panting]
41400d I just don't understand why, Fluttershy. After all, you're the one that wanted the Pony Tones to sing for every silly thing that was requested of us.
41400e You mean, you knew I really wanted to perform?
41400d Of course I knew!
41400e Oh...
41400d And, for all her babbling, Pinkie Pie was right about one thing.
414007 Only one?!
41400d When that curtain fell, and everypony saw you singing, you lived your worst nightmare! Was it really that bad?
41400e Yes!
414003 Well, what was so bad about it?
41400c The thunderous applause?
414008 The praise for your fantastic singin'?
414007 The screaming fans?!
41400e [Fluttershy]
41400e There's music in the treetops
41400e And there's music in the vale
41400e And all around the music fills the sky
41400e There's music by the river
41400e And there's music in the grass
41400e And the music makes your heart soar in reply
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 When you find you've got the music
41400e [Fluttershy]
41400e You've got to look inside and find
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Find you've got the music
41400e [Fluttershy]
41400e The music deep inside you
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Find you've got the music
41400e [Fluttershy]
41400e 'Cause when you look inside, you'll see it
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 Find you've got the music
41400e [Fluttershy]
41400e You're gonna find it, gonna find
414000 [The Pony Tones]
414000 You've got the music
414000 Got the music, got the music
414000 Got the music in you!
414231 [cheering]
41400c You did it, Fluttershy!
414008 See? That wasn't so bad.
414007 And you didn't look completely petrified by the fact that we're all staring at you at all!
414003 How do you feel?
41400e Surprisingly... okay!
41400d Fantastic, because the Pony Tones have been booked for the Apple Family Zap Apple Jam Extraordinaire!
41400e Oh, no... I couldn't do that!
414008 How come?
41400c Rainbow Dash:
41400c Seriously?
414007 Pinkie Pie:
414007 For real?
414003 Twilight Sparkle:
414003 Come on, Fluttershy...
41400e I'll get there someday. But for now... baby steps, everypony. Baby steps.
41400e Sometimes, being afraid can stop you from doing something that you love, but hiding behind these fears means you're only hiding from your true self. It's much better to face those fears so you can shine and be the best pony you can possibly be.
414000 [credits]
415003 Uh, Sweetie Belle, maybe we should run through the steps another few times before you try it on your own.
415066 Nope. Ready to give it a shot!
415003 Okay then!
415066 [straining] Can't... seem... to...! [straining] [neck clicks] Ugh! Think I threw my neck out...
415065 Aw, you're okay.
41500a A little more magic practice and liftin' brooms'll be a cinch!
415066 I doubt it. That thing weighs a ton.
415000 [door opens]
415005 Hey, has anypony seen my– Oh, there it is. [whistling]
415066 Hmph. I'll never get my cutie mark for this...
415003 Maybe not. But I'm happy to keep helping you learn just for the fun of it as long as you like.
415005 Hey, who's gonna clean up this mess?
415065 This is no mess! These are the carefully arranged pieces of a unicycle I took apart and will be putting back together... as soon as Twilight shows me how. [squee]
415003 Scootaloo, I already told you I won't show you how, but I'll help you find the instructions so you can figure it out yourself.
415065 Ugh, I hate research!
415003 To your left, third shelf from the bottom. You'll find it in no time.
41500a Thanks so much for helpin' us all learn these new skills, Twilight.
415003 Always glad to pass on my love of learning for learning's sake.
41500a Only I'm afraid I'll never get the hang of this potion-makin'.
415003 Did you follow the magic plant-growing formula I gave you?
41500a Well... uh... more or less.
415003 Well, let's try it out on this apple seedling and see how we do.
41500a Oh... I hope this works.
415000 [drip]
415000 [poof]
415003 [coughing]
415232 [coughing]
415105 [giggling]
41500a Layin' it on a little thick there, aren't we, pal?
415000 [theme song]
415000 [ball bouncing]
41505c Yoo-hoo! Gather 'round! It's time!
4150f3 [various intrigued noises]
41505c As you all know, I had promised to put on an amazing, first-time-ever acrobatic display for you all today!
4150f3 [cheering]
41505c I know, it's so exciting. But I'm tired.
4150f3 Awww...
41505c But I did not wish to disappoint you all, so I brought my butler Randolph to do them for me.
4150f3 [cheering]
41505f That was amazing, Diamond Tiara.
41505c I know. I don't know how I do it.
41500a I can't believe she gets so much attention without even really doing anything!
415065 She's using somepony else to build herself up, and without even putting any effort to learn her own skills like we do!
415066 Hey, come to think of it, if we get really good at the stuff Twilight's teaching us, we could be the big shots around here for a change! Hmm...
415065 Check this out!
41500a And check this out!
4150f3 [awed comments]
415066 Now check this out!
41505c [yelping] Hey, put me down!
4150f3 [laughing]
415066 [giggling]
41505c Hey, can you hear me?
415066 Huh? Huh? What? What?
41505c I was asking if your sister Rarity will be taking you to Manehattan anytime soon.
41505f Because if she is, maybe you can meet up with us while we hang out with a bunch of famous celebrities.
415065 Cool!
41500a Wow, that's... pretty nice of you guys.
415066 Actually, my sister hasn't offered to take me to Manehattan anytime soon.
41505c Yeah, we figured.
415060 Bump, bump, sugar lump rump! [laughing]
415066 Oh, yeah?! Well, I don't have to go all the way to Manehattan to hang out with the famous and super-cool ponies! Me and my friends hang out with Princess Twilight all the time!
41505c D-did you say Princess Twilight?! You hang out with her all the time? For real?
41500a More like just once a week.
415065 She helps us learn cool new stuff to do! That we actually do ourselves!
41505c You must bring me along next time you go!
41505f Bring us along!
41505c I mean, we used to see her around town all the time, and I thought, "whatever"...
41505f Me too. I thought that.
41505c But now she's a princess, which makes her totally awesome!
41505f Plus, she has wings.
41505c And she's an Alicorn. So can I–
41505f We!
41505c –go?
41500a I don't think we should–
415066 Would you two excuse us for a moment? We should totally say yes! This is a golden opportunity!
41500a Are you kiddin'? I don't want them laughing at us while I'm mixin' potions and accidentally sendin' plants into chokin' fits!
415066 But don't you get it? They'll have to learn something too!
415065 And they won't be able to laugh at us when they're so busy trying to learn stuff of their own.
41500a I must admit it's kinda fun to see them workin' hard to get on our good side for a change.
41505c Oh, my gosh! A princess lives in there! And I'm about to go inside and see her! I can't even tell you how excited I am!
41505f I can't either!
415000 [knocking]
415066 Now remember, Twilight takes this time out with us so we can learn stuff.
415003 Hey there, guys! Come on in!
415060 [squealing] Princess Twilight!
41505c Oh, it's really her!
41505f Oh, my gosh, I don't believe it!
415003 Oh, and, uh, you brought guests. Great!
41505c Princess Twilight, it is such a thrill and honor to be here! You have no idea. Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?
41505f I so have to get that done.
415003 Actually, it's not dyed. I've always–
41505c [gasp] Are those books in there? What a bold design choice!
41505f You should so do that, Di!
41505c I know, right?
415003 Listen, I'm all for helping as many ponies as I can, but maybe we should keep these weekly visits just between us, hm? Okay, which one of you wants to practice first?
415066 Shouldn't they go first?
415003 No, silly! I set up Twilight Time especially for you. Apple Bloom, go ahead. Let's see how your plant potions are coming.
41500a I can't believe I let you talk us into bringin' guests yesterday.
415065 I didn't hear them laugh at us once, Apple Bloom.
41500a 'Cause they laughed on the inside.
415066 Don't worry. We won't make that same mistake again.
41500a Aw, great. Look who showed up to make fun of us.
415065 So much for learning skills to be big shots.
41505c Hey, guess what! I told everyone about your special Twilight Time!
415066 Oh, no, here it comes...
41505c And they all want in!
4150f3 Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]
41505c Thanks to me, you three are now the hottest thing around. You're welcome.
415066 Uh-oh...
4150f3 Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]
415066 Wow! All these ponies really wanna meet Twilight that badly?
4150f2 We love you, Cutie Mark Crusaders!
4150f3 [cheering]
41505c Now, now, everypony! Demanding time with the princess as an unruly mob simply won't do. Might I suggest you get organized through us, the Cutie Mark Crusaders' nearest and dearest friends?
41505f Everypony get in line! No pushing, no pushing!
4150f3 [cheering, under]
41500a What a mess.
415066 Of awesome! Don't you see? We're really and truly and certifiably the biggest of the big shots in school right now!
415065 Huh?
415066 They all think we're the greatest, because we're their ticket to get time with Ponyville's newest and biggest celebrity, Princess Twilight!
41500a We just said like two seconds ago that invitin' two ponies to Twilight Time was a big mistake! And now we're supposed to bring the whole class?
415066 Relax. I got this.
41500a I don't like this, Sweetie Belle...
415066 You said not to invite them to Twilight Time and I didn't. So what's the problem?
415065 This feels like a trick.
415066 What's tricky about inviting Twilight out for a meal thanking her for all the nice things she's done for us? Seems like the least we can do for the princess!
4150f2 Did someone say "princess"?
415066 When I told you when you could come eyeball the princess at one of her favorite hangouts, I said only two or three of you, tops!
4150f3 Oops...
415065 She's coming!
415066 Okay! But stay out of sight!
41505c As you wish, Sweetie Belle.
415066 Yes, as I wish.
415003 [messy eating noises] Mmm! Mmmm, mm! [with mouth full] I didn't realize how hungry I was! I'm so glad you asked me to join you here today... [swallows] I'm so honored! Mm!
415066 You are?
415003 When you first asked me to help you develop new skills, I thought, 'Working with young students so devoted to the joy of learning purely for its own sake? What could be better?' You all remind me of myself when I was your age!
415066 Yes, well... we feel the same way.
41500a That's why we invited you here.
415065 All because of our love of learning!
415003 [sipping drink]
415007 Twilight! Haven't seen you here in, like, forever and a half!
415003 I know. I've been so busy I forgot how delicious everything is here!
415007 Totally! Hey, what's going on out there? Oh, never mind, they're gone. They're back! Never mind, they're gone. La la-la la-la...
415000 [cameras clicking]
41500a [through gritted teeth] Knock it off!
415003 What in the world is going on out– [gasp]
41500a What was all this? And this?
415065 I couldn't help it! When I don't smile in a picture, I look sad.
415066 Oh, we're gonna look sad all right...
415000 [doors close]
415003 [gasps] [long pause] Uh, can I... help you?
4150f3 [excited screaming]
41505c Get my picture with her!
4150f2 Me first!
41505f Hey! Get out of the shot!
415066 This is bad.
415065 Twilight's gonna be so ticked at us.
41500a I told ya this was a terrible idea.
415003 You seriously all want my autograph? Okay, I'll sign just a couple more for you, but then I really must get back to my little friends. Oh, there you are!
4150f2 Wow, to think I've been to the Hay Burger so many times, never knowing it's a regular hangout for a princess!
415003 This isn't my regular hangout. I'm only here to be with them.
4150f2 You mean, Princess Twilight decides where it's cool to go based on where they go?
415080 Huh?
415003 Thanks, guys, this was fun! See ya around!
4150f3 [excited chattering]
4150f2 I'm opening a new lemonade stand! Won't you come to the grand opening? I'll give you free lemonade for a week!
415066 Relax. I know exactly how to handle this.
415000 [scissors cutting]
4150f3 [cheering]
415000 [glasses clinking]
4150f2 More lemonade?
415066 Don't mind if I do!
415233 Done shining your hooves! It's an honor to do you the favor!
415065 Whoa, so bright I can see myself!
41500a And so can I! Nice job bedazzlin' my bow! What do I owe you?
415234 Your gratitude is thanks enough.
41505c You three must come to my pool party. It'll be much cooler than this.
415066 Look who's inviting who to her fancy house!
41500a I believe we have arrived, Cutie Mark Crusaders.
415080 Yeah!
415000 [splash]
41500a [laughs]
415066 Wow, this is nice, but there's no one else here. Why is this party cooler, exactly?
41505c Because of all the ponies we're keeping out.
415066 This has been great, but we have to go. It's Twilight Time.
41505c So, we're coming too, right?
415066 Um... a-actually, no. We didn't have a chance to ask Twilight, so–
41505c Really? After all the favors we did for you? After all the favors they did for you?
4150f3 Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]
415066 Okay, I know exactly how to handle this. Run!
4150f3 Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! Twilight Time! [continuing under]
415080 [straining]
415066 Go, go, go!
415065 We gotta beat them to Twilight's so we can explain!
415066 This way! I know a shortcut!
4150f3 Twilight Time! [continuing under]
41500a Then we run, like the wind!
4150f3 Twilight Time! Twilight Time!
415066 [gasps] [out of breath] We... made... it... Quick! Knock on–
415000 [tires screeching]
415000 [knocking]
415000 [door opens]
415066 Twilight, we can explain.
41500a We know you said we should just keep Twilight Time to us!
415065 We didn't mean for so many other ponies to be here! Honest!
415003 Oh, don't be silly. I only meant that for your benefit so you could get the most out of our time together. But if you want to share your time with others, that's fine.
415065 So you're not mad?
415003 Of course not! Come on in, everypony! Spike made nachos!
4150f3 [excited chattering]
415003 Turns out we'll need some more than that.
415005 [sighs]
4150f3 [excited chattering]
415003 Before we start, we should maybe get a bit more organized? Ponies interested in magic in this corner. Ponies who want to learn potions over here. Bookworm ponies over there.
41500a Incredible. Looks like everything's workin' out just fine.
415065 And I was so afraid Twilight would be disappointed in us.
415066 Told you I knew exactly how to handle all this!
415003 Thanks to all of you for taking time out to come learn new things.
41505c Thank you, princess!
41505f We love you, princess!
4150f3 [You're awesome, etc.]
415003 Okay, okay, let's settle down. If you want to thank anypony, thank the Cutie Mark Crusaders for so generously sharing this time.
415066 It was nothing, really. We just felt it was the right thing to do.
41505c Hmph! What a laugh.
415003 Let's begin over here. And what would you like to learn, little one?
4150f2 I want to learn how to become a Cutie Mark Crusader!
415003 And why do you want to become a Cutie Mark Crusader so badly, hm?
4150f2 Because then I could get all my classmates to do me favors and stuff because I'm friends with a famous princess!
415066 Oh, boy.
415003 Is this true?
415066 We wanted our time together just as a way to be with you and learn new things. Really and truly!
415003 Prove it.
415066 Huh?!
415003 If it's true, then I'm sure you've all been practicing your skills over the past week. Show me how much better you got.
41500a Uh, well, uh... we... can't.
415065 We kinda rushed over and forgot to bring our stuff.
415003 Hm, I see.
415066 No, wait! Hey, everypony, you're in luck! You came to learn, but instead you're getting dinner and a show! Get ready, 'cause we, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, are about to lay on you the amazing skills we learned in Twilight Time!
4150f3 [intrigued chatter]
415066 Unfortunately, since we don't have Scootaloo's unicycle parts, she'll take apart and put back together one of the scooters from outside.
4150f2 Hey! That's my scooter!
415065 You got us into this mess, kid. Might wanna roll with us.
4150f2 Huh?
415066 Apple Bloom doesn't have her apple seed with her, so she'll just grab an apple from the kitchen. And I will begin by using my magic to lift this broom!
415065 Ta-da!
41500a Become a tree!
415066 Rise!
415000 [creaking]
415000 [boom]
415066 That didn't turn out quite how I had hoped.
415003 Looks like Twilight Time is over.
41505c And look who's not the princess's entourage anymore.
4150f3 Oooh!
41505f Guess they didn't come here to learn after all.
415003 Well, neither did any of you.
4150f3 Awww...
415066 We're really sorry, Twilight. We made a huge mistake.
41500a And we really and truly did enjoy learning new skills with you.
415065 Guess we'll have to just keep on doing it without you now. Thanks, Twilight.
415000 [poof]
41500a Thanks...
415066 Thanks...
415003 Sweetie Belle? Remember a moment ago when you asked me to give you a chance?
415005 [straining] Aw, come on!
415066 I guess Twilight must not be so super-upset anymore, 'cause she's letting us do a diary entry like our sisters do. Boy, did we get our priorities messed up. We started acting special because we were friends with someone special. We almost forgot the real reason she's special – because she's our friend. But she forgave us, and, like magic, things are good as new! That's the kind of magic I really want to get good at, now that I'm getting so good at the other kind.
415003 Wow, all three of you have made so much progress! I'm really proud of you. See you next time!
415066 We're just glad Twilight Time is back to normal. Well... almost back to normal. I just hope no one sees us.
41500a 'Cause we're tryin' to keep Twilight Time a secret now?
415065 Or because we look ridiculous?
415066 A little of both, actually.
415003 [laughs]
415000 [credits]
41600e Okay, everypony. As you know, the adorable fairy creatures known as Breezies are about to come through Ponyville.
416007 Yes! Ooh, it's so exciting! Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close!
41600c I've never done it before, not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!
41600e And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things, so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land. Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny! I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!
416007 I love cheers!
41600e But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them. They need to be able to concentrate. Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies.
416015 [shouting] You can do it, Breezies!
41600e Oh, my.
416008 Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly.
41600e Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again.
416015 [quieter but still loudly] You can do it, Breezies!
41600e Perhaps just a little bit quieter.
416015 [quieter] You can do it, Breezies!
41600e Just a little quieter.
416015 [practically whispering] You can do it, Breezies!
41600e [loudly] Perfect! Oh, um, I mean... yay.
416000 [theme song]
416000 [mariachi music playing]
416000 [wind blowing]
41600c That's too strong! We gotta slow this breeze down or we're gonna blow those Breezies apart!
41602b What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them.
41600e Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic, and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed.
41602b So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad?
41600e That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back before the portal to their home closes. That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.
41602a We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path!
41600e Now you understand.
41602b Hm, you certainly know a lot about them.
41600e Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in Western Equestria. Um, Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but...
41600d Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there? I knew it! But Twilight refused to admit it.
416003 What?! I-
41600e Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple. It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket.
41600d Oh, darling, please! One can never have too many sequins! [chuckles]
41600e You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes, and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!
41600d I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins. I'll just take off my jacket. I suppose this won't do either?
416003 [whispering] Everypony, it's time. Please welcome... the Breezies!
416008 They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.
41600d And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?
416235 Lun! Arshen aifok!
416007 So... cute! Can't... take... it!
416005 [grunts] [hushed] Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?
416007 [hushed, straining] May explode!
416000 [thunk]
416000 [wind blows]
416005 Oh, no!
416236 [panicking]
4160ec [gasps]
41600c Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!
41617d They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies!
41600c What if we speed it up?
416178 Then the first group'll be going too fast, and they'll get separated from each other!
416236 [panicking]
416236 [panicking]
416235 Tanagretu nik mir! Maisegu de piripa!
41600e [gasps]
416235 Mekenar stuf!
41600e He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can!
4160ec [cheering]
416235 Mugudi saikendus?
41600e Oh, I understand the language of all kinds of creatures!
416235 You must be so proud.
41600e And you speak my language too?
416235 I can. This lot can only understand you. Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around.
416236 [shouts of indignation]
416007 That was amazing!
41600c I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
41600e Oh, it's not your fault.
416003 I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that.
41600d I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh... Or a sash. At least a sash.
416005 Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?! [crying] I'm sorry! This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry!
41600e Oh, Spike, it's okay! It could have happened to any one of us.
416005 Okay... Thank you!
416236 [shouting]
416005 Uh... I'm... just... gonna stay over here.
41600c So, Fluttershy, you want us to get the breeze going again so these little guys can get a move on?
416236 [cries of protest]
41600e Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...
41600c Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.
416040 [whimpers]
41600e Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket.
416237 Sanken
41600e Oh, no problem.
416238 Malenki?
41600e Oh, did you need some more water?
416238 [slurps]
41600e Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?
416236 [cheering]
416008 Hey there! Can we come in?
41600e Oh, of course! But watch your step!
416008 Oop, sorry about that, little one.
416003 We just wanted to see if you thought the Breezies were ready to give it another try.
41600e Has it been an hour already? Oh, my goodness! Time flies when you're making sure little creatures don't feel that you're abandoning them to the cruel world.
416003 But they're not going to a cruel world, right? They're going home.
41600e Oh, yes, that's right!
416236 [cries of protest]
41600e On second thought, I don't think they're quite ready.
416235 Supa laipas data kurpa! Mise neku ersken laika maur! Siripat sulat!
416008 Uh... what did he say?
41600e I'd... rather not say.
416008 Okay, well, I'm sure you know what you're doin'. No one knows rare magical creatures like you do.
416003 We'll just wait for your word.
41600e Thank you. I'll be in touch very soon.
416000 [door closes]
416235 We need to go now, or we will never get home! I wish we did not need that stupid breeze to activate our magic, or I would just force you all to fly home right now! Why do we have to need magic to keep our pollen safe?
41600e Um, now, Seabreeze-
416235 Why are you giving in to these wimps?! If they had not been so scared in the first place, this never would have happened!
41600e But that is just not true, Seabreeze. It was because of a leaf, and you know that!
416235 Oh, please! They have no idea what they're doing out there! Like you said, we need as much time as we can get because they are so incompetent!
41600e Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?
416235 Hmph!
41600e Oh, well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood.
416236 [coos of interest]
416236 [chewing]
416238 [burp] Mi fargen.
41600e You're excused. Well, my Breezies, I think we can all agree that now that you've eaten and you have a little energy going in your breezy bodies, you're strong enough to face the breeze! I've loved having you here, and I hope I've made you all feel loved and special. But you have to go. Nopony here will deny that-
416235 There is nothing special about these losers! They cannot handle a simple breeze home! If they could just stick with the program and listen to me, we would be safe! At home! Home, where every Breezie is like us! [sighs]
41600e Okay, well, a confusing pep-talk, but nonetheless. I do know that if you don't leave soon, you may never make it back, and that would be terrible!
416238 [sneezes] Merte marshken farde.
416237 [coughs] Merki marshken plumatu.
41600e I had no idea you all have colds! Really? All of you?
416236 [coughing]
41600e Oh, dear. I can't let you go out there sick! What kind of a friend would I be if I made you go now?
416236 [excited chattering]
416235 D'oh! Irde turten manes pudenhel! Nievo ut! Parde tarmen!
416000 [knocking]
41600c Hey, Fluttershy, just wondering if the Breezies are ready to go yet. Clock's kinda ticking for them to make it back before the door closes on their home.
41600e Oh, yes. I mean, not quite. Um, maybe just a few more minutes?
416000 [door closes]
41600c Uh, alright.
416178 We wait too much longer, we'll have to create such a strong breeze, it may be more than they can handle.
41600c We just have to trust Fluttershy. She must know what she's doing.
416236 [excited chattering]
416000 [saxophone playing]
416000 [crash]
416236 Aww!
416235 Why are you spending your time on this?! I will never get home!
41600e Breezies, I must say, Seabreeze has a point. I think it's time for me to get Rainbow Dash and her friends so they can create the breeze for you to get home.
416236 [dismayed shouts]
41600e Ooh... You're all awfully anxious... Oh, I don't want you to feel abandoned, or that I wasn't the most kind host I could possibly be...
416237 Adoshen papan gorn.
41600e Oh, yes, that does make sense... Seabreeze, do you think you could wait just a couple more hou- Seabreeze? Seabreeze? Has anypony seen Seabreeze? [gasps] Where's he going? There's no way he can handle being out there on his own!
416000 [wind blows]
416235 Ah! Ah! Ah! Blusken! Ah! Ah! Arge nusen! Uf! Osemi! Ah! Narsken! Noi serenda! Ah!
416000 [series of thumps]
416235 Ah! Gah! Ah! Kesino! Uu! Tu ge! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Miuse konda!
416000 [squeak]
416000 [bees buzzing]
416235 Vaior uskren! Yavaya...
416000 [bees buzzing]
416235 Ibeku-u-u! Ah, sa-sabada!
41600e Excuse me, bees? Can you please back off my Breezie friend? He didn't mean any harm. It was just an accident. I'm working on a bee-type dance and was hoping you could help me? Does this bring to mind any images for you? Perhaps a bee? Excuse me! I have done nothing but be kind, but I guess that is not working! You bees know better than to hurt a helpless Breezie! I demand that you go away now, or you'll have to answer to me!
416235 Menkyulen. Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you for coming after me!
41600e Of course. You could've gotten seriously hurt out there. Ponyville is much too dangerous for you. One tiny acorn is a threat!
416235 Yeah, I know! That is one reason why I have been trying to get us to go from the beginning!
41600e Oh, my goodness. I was just trying not to hurt any creature's feelings, but my displays of kindness may have cost you everything... [gasps] Time is running out, and you may never make it home!
416235 That is exactly what I have been telling all of them! But they do not listen to me! Nobreezie ever listens to me!
41600e Seabreeze, I understand your feelings are hurt, but it's hard for them to hear you when you're shouting and being mean. The message doesn't get across.
416235 But what about those bees? You were not nice to them, and that was the only way they listened!
41600e Yes, but they had to go, and they wouldn't listen to me any other way. We need to go, now!
41600e My dear Breezies, I had to rescue Seabreeze from serious harm, and now I know more than ever that you must leave before it's too late! You would never survive in Ponyville.
416236 Erski parli polin!
41600e I can't help you any more. In fact, I wasn't helping you at all by being nice. Oh... But the truth of the matter is that I must be firm! You must go, now! [sniffs] [crying]
416000 [door closes]
416000 [wind blowing]
41600c It's too strong!
416178 I can't do it any lighter!
41617d Neither can I!
41600c Fly back! I'm gonna try and see if I can slow it down. Now it's too light! Oh, this will never get them home!
41600e Oh, my. Maybe it's because there are too few of them. When they started their journey, there was more of them to face the breeze together.
416003 I've been studying an old spell book from the Castle of the Two Sisters. There's a spell that I think could help us! This is probably gonna feel a little funny at first, but you're gonna have to trust me.
416007 I love new ideas that make me feel funny at first!
41600e [gasps]
41600d [gasps]
416007 [giggles]
416012 [excited noises]
41600e Maifo flai batendud! [high-pitched] Um, I mean, let's go!
416000 [wind blowing]
416239 Marskin farskin.
416238 Metar.
416235 You can do this! I am sorry for how I treated you before! It was not right that I called you names! I did not even really believe those things I said! I was worried we would never get back to our home, and I lashed out... I know you can do this! I believe in you! Hold on to me, let us join the group!
416000 [wind blowing]
416012 [gasps]
41600c [high-pitched] Holy mini-sized paradise!
41600d [high-pitched] This is simply beautiful! So much inspiration. Where's my sketchpad when I need it?
416007 [high-pitched] So...stinkin'...cute!
416236 [commotion]
416008 [high-pitched] You okay, Fluttershy?
41600e [high-pitched] I'm just so very happy they got to be reunited with their family!
416236 [commotion]
41600d [high-pitched] We'd better get going before the entrance- well, exit for us, closes.
41600e [high-pitched] Goodbye, Breezies. I must go now.
416235 To remember us by.
41600e [high-pitched] Thank you! I'll miss you. I'll miss all of you! [voiceover, normal] My experiences with the Breezies have helped me to see that kindness can take many forms, and sometimes being too kind can actually keep a friend from doing what they need to do. Pushing them away may seem cruel, but it's sometimes the kindest thing you can do.
41600c [high-pitched] Whoa! That was a close one!
416043 [agreeing]
416003 [high-pitched] Okay, gather round.
416000 [magic zaps]
41600c So, uh, I've always kinda wondered what it would be like to be a griffon.
416003 Not a chance.
41600c You sure? What about a dragon? No? It doesn't have to shoot fire!
416000 [credits]
41723a [muffled conversation]
417065 Whatever they decide, Apple Bloom, we'll be here for you.
417066 Totally. Even though it could change everything for you, forever and ever!
417000 [door opens]
417009 So, we here have decided... that you're old enough to stay home alone and take care of the chores yourself for the afternoon!
4170ef [gasps]
41700a I accept your decision.
4170ef [cheering]
417000 [theme song]
41700a Stayin' home alone, by myself, on my own! I can't believe I'm really doin' it!
417008 Now, hey there, filly. I know you're excited, but bein' the only pony here to take care of the day's chores is a big responsibility.
41700a I know it! And it means everythin' to me that y'all think I'm grown up enough to handle it. I won't let you down.
417009 Well, if'n I'm gonna make my train, I best to be off. When Great Aunt Pine Apple says a pony's gots to ride by a certain time, you better be there! You be sure and take care now, Apple Bloom. Y'all take care as well. I don't know which of your delivery routes is tougher. you're each headed to a mighty hard-to-reach town.
417026 Eeyup.
417008 We know, Granny. That's the only reason I agreed to let Apple Bloom stay behind alone.
41700a It is?
417008 Oh, I didn't mean it like that, sugarcube. It's just, I take my job as your big sister real serious, which is why I spent all night makin' this.
41700a What is it?
417008 Just a little list of helpful reminders.
41700a [reading] "There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator. Be sure not to heat it up too much. If it's hot, blow on it to cool it off. And take little sips—if you gulp, you could get hiccups." You don't have to worry about me. I can take care of myself and the chores! I'm ready for this.
417008 [sighs] I guess you are. I'm just not so sure I am.
41700a But you trust me and believe I'm grown up enough to handle this, right?
417008 [sighs] Right. Okay then. Good luck, little sis— whoa!
41700a [quickly] Okaygreatseeyousoonbye!
41723b [various goodbyes]
417026 Eyuu-up!
41700a Woo-hoo! I'm alone! At home! I'm home alone! This is gonna be so awesome!
417008 [teeth chattering] [grunts]
417000 [thud]
417008 Eheheh... Sorry, Big Mac. I was just frettin' a bit about Apple Bloom. You think she's gonna be okay on her own?
417026 Eeyup.
417008 I just keep on thinkin' of things I forgot to put on her list. Like, I didn't write down that if she wants to get a spoon out of the drawer, she needs to open the drawer first. [sighs] I know, I'm probably just bein' silly.
417026 Eeyup.
417008 But I know I'd feel a heap better if I could just check on Apple Bloom one last time. You go on ahead and make your delivery. I'm just gonna take a quick peek, and then I'll make mine.
41700a Okay, number one seventy two - "Make sure to pump the bellows to keep the stove warm."
417000 [bellows pumping]
41700a Check! "Make sure the hats and bows closet is fully stocked." Check! [spits] That's everything on Applejack's list! And now that my chores are done, since there's no one else here, I get to make all the decisions! If I wanna listen to music, I can! If I wanna read a book, I can! If I wanna just stand here in the kitchen talkin' to myself, I can!
417008 Apple Bloom!
41700a Whoa!
417000 [crash]
41700a Ugh... Applejack?
417008 I came back to check on you, and I'm so glad I did! I never thought about how dangerous things are around here!
41700a Thanks, but I'm really gonna be okay.
417008 You are now! Because I'm here and I'm stayin'! No way am I leavin' my little baby sister home alone all by herself!
41700a I'm not a baby! I can take care of myself! And what about those pies you're supposed to deliver?
417008 Pies? Ha! Family's way more important than pies!
41700a But I'm fine! And actually... this was kind of your fault.
417008 I know. I should never have left you alone.
41700a But I don't need you lookin' after me. I'm perfectly capable of stayin' home alone. Really! Just look! "There's some soup for you in the 'frigerator."
417008 What was that?
41700a Watch me!
417000 [jars clinking]
417000 [splat]
41700a Whoa! Ugh!
417008 Oh, no! This is worse than I thought! Well, don't worry, Apple Bloom, I'm here now and I'm not leavin' you home alone ever again. I'm stickin' right by your side, always!
417008 Apple Bloom? Apple Bloom!
41700a Applejack's just overreactin' a bit. I'm sure she'll snap out of it. Whoa!
417008 You need somethin'? I'm right here!
41700a I know you mean well, but I don't need you watchin' over me! I can take care of things myself!
417008 [laughs]
41700a Look! Huh? Hey! Who put pillows on this rake?
417008 [chuckles] Oh, I don't know. Maybe someone who really loves her little sister and doesn't want her to get an owie?
41700a [growls]
41700a Hey, Applejack! Watch me buck these apples on my own without anythin' bad happenin' to me! [grunts]
417000 [thunk]
417000 [leaves rustling]
41700a Huh? [growls]
41700a Hm? Hm.
417000 [door opens]
41700a Oh, for the love of...! [sighs] You've gone and baby-proofed everythin'!
417008 Heh, yup! Your big sister let you down once, but I promise it won't ever happen again.
41700a But really, I'm fine! I can take care of myself. I don't need you watchin' over me!
417008 Aw, that's sweet. I appreciate you tryin' to make me feel better, but don't worry. I'll always be here for you. Always!
41700a [growls]
41700a [sighs] And that's the reason I asked y'all to come over quick.
417008 Hey, Apple Bloom! You need anything? A snack? A hoof massage? Maybe a snack while havin' a hoof massage?
417066 Why, that sounds delightful!
41700a [through gritted teeth] No thank you!
417008 O-kay, well you can count on me bein' close by if'n you need anythin'!
41700a [sighs] You see what I mean? If this keeps up, I'm never gonna be able to do anythin' without Applejack hoverin' over me!
417105 Mm-hm.
417065 So what can we do? Hmm.
417066 Uh...
417065 Um...
41700a Hang on a sec! I got it!
417066 What?
41700a The pies! I'll sneak out and deliver them! Granny said that they were goin' to some incredibly hard-to-reach town. If I can do it alone, that'll show Applejack I don't need somepony watchin' over me!
417065 Just one problem. Your sister's gonna come back and check on you any minute!
417066 Which means you need an escape plan.
417065 Ooh, and I got an idea for one! [mocks snoring] See? It'll look just like you're sleeping in bed. Sweetie and I can take turns! That way, when one of us gets tired, the other can take over. Brilliant, huh?
417066 Mm-hm!
41700a You know what? It is! I got a feelin' this just might work!
41700a We're gonna make my sister see
41700a I don't need her watchin' over me—
417065 Stop! No time for a song! Applejack's coming!
417066 If you're gonna go, we've gotta get you out of here now!
41700a Cutie Mark Crusaders, let's do it!
417000 [window opens]
41700a Whoa!
417000 [wheels clattering]
417008 [muffled] Everythin' okay in there, sugarcube?
417065 Quick, get in while I hide! Sweetie, no! You gotta sleep like Apple Bloom!
417066 How does she sleep?
417065 Like she does everything! With sass!
417008 Huh. I guess you must've been so tuckered out, you sent your friends home and went to bed. Then again, you are a delicate flower. [sighs] Sleep tight, Apple Bloom. I'll check on you again in a bit.
417000 [door closes]
417105 [sighs]
417000 [door opens]
417008 Just checkin' in on you again!
417000 [door closes]
417000 [door opens]
417008 Need anythin' now?
417000 [door opens]
417008 How 'bout now?
417000 [door opens]
417008 Need another blanket?
417000 [door opens]
417008 Did I hear a cough?
417000 [door opens]
417008 Want a glass of water?
417000 [clock ticking]
417066 [snoring]
417000 [door opens]
417008 [yawning] Just... checkin' in on you again. [sighs] Look at you, dozin' so peaceful-like. Here I am, checkin' up on you every five seconds, and you're totally fine. Maybe you don't need me frettin' over you all the time.
417065 [gasps] [muffled] Wow, Apple Bloom will be so glad to hear that!
417008 Huh? Scootaloo?
417065 Uh, um, n-no.
417008 Sweetie Belle? But... where's Apple Bloom? She's not here! She could be anywhere! She could be lost, cold, hungry, itchy, stuffed up, needin' to go to the bathroom!
417066 Don't worry, we know exactly where she is.
417065 Yeah, she's making your pie delivery.
417008 What?! No! Didn't she hear how difficult and dangerous it was?! [gasp] I may never see my little sister again!
417008 Okay, Rarity's on her way here to look after you two. Now tell me, did Apple Bloom at least bring flameproof boots? A lion tamer's chair? A snake charmin' flute?! A hunk of ricotta?! [gasps] [teeth chattering] Okay, maybe there's still time to catch her before she gets there. When did she leave?
417066 It must've been hours ago.
417008 Oh, no!
41700a [sigh] I can't see a darn thing in this swamp. [yelps]
417000 [flames whooshing]
41700a Well, now at least I can see.
417000 [chimera growls]
41723c I'd stay where you are. This is the only safe spot around here.
41700a [nervous whimpering] It don't look so safe to me.
41723c Oh, we just mean from the flames.
41723d Yeah, not from us.
41723e What was that? Ah, can you guysss ssspeak up?
41723c I was about to tell our guest how we haven't eaten in days.
41723d My sisters and I can never agree on what to eat.
41723e [hisses] Excccept... pie.
41700a Well, unfortunately, I gotta get these pies to a town on the other side of the swamp, so, uh...
41723c Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
41723d Yeah, you don't have to worry about anything anymore.
41723e Because we're going to have our apple pie with a ssside of filly filet.
41700a You don't say. [laughs nervously]
41723f [growling, bleating, and hissing]
41723c Now, sisters, on three! One!
41723d Two!
41723e [hisses] Three!
417000 [thud]
41700a No!
41723c Where do you think you're going? [growling]
41723e [hisses]
41700a Yaaah! [panting] [straining noises]
41723f [growls, bleats, and hisses]
41723c Where are the pies?!
41723e They're not back here.
41723d This is your fault! You think you've always got to be in charge!
41723c [sighs] You're lucky, you know? You've got no idea what it's like to have a sister constantly looking over your shoulder!
41700a Uh, actually...
41723d Let's try listening to me for a change! And I say, if there are no pies, let's settle for the filly filet!
41723e [hisses] Any lassst wordsss?
41700a I really wish my sister were here!
417008 Hang on, Apple Bloom! I'm a-comin'!
417240 Get her!
41723d Hey! I thought I was in charge now!
41723c [growls]
417008 [plays snake charming flute]
41723e [hisses]
41723c [growls] [roars]
417008 Howdy!
417000 [stretching noise]
417000 [smash]
41723c [groaning]
41723d [growls] [bleats] Mm, ricotta!
41723f [distressed]
417008 Let's go!
417000 [flames whooshing]
417008 [panting] Are you okay?
41700a Thanks to you.
417008 I told you you need your big sister lookin' after you! I'm just glad this wasn't a whole lot worse. I mean, sure we lost the cart and all the pies, but at least you're— huh, the cart! And all the pies! You actually got them all the way up here? In the dark? Through the Flame Geyser Swamp? Past that monster? ...By yourself?
41700a Well... yeah.
417008 Huh, wow. That's mighty impressive! Anypony who can do that on her own, well, she don't need somepony like me babyin' her.
417241 Mm-hm! Andouille! This pie's even tastier than my momma's swamp water casserole!
417000 [Cajun ponies cheering]
417241 Aw, now, momma, don't be like that.
417008 Just remember, you fellas wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies if it weren't for my sister.
41700a And my sister!
417008 But this don't change the fact that tryin' to make this delivery on your own was a plumb crazy thing to do!
41700a I know...
417008 [scoffs] I bet Granny Smith grounds you for a month for sneakin' out! And if Big Mac, Granny Smith 'n I ever have to be away for the day again... I would totally trust you to stay home and take care of things on your own. I guess I did get a little carried away watchin' over you, and if you hadn't snuck out like you did, maybe I wouldn't have figured that out.
41700a Yes! Now that is the kind of 'looking after me' that I can definitely appreciate! So... we're good?
417008 Little sister, we're always good.
417000 [credits]
418008 Has anypony heard from Pinkie Pie since yesterday?
418024 Nuh-uh.
41800c [yawns] I don't see what's so important we had to meet her here this early. Celestia hasn't even raised the sun yet!
418000 [rooster snores]
418003 I hope everything's okay. [knocks]
418000 [muffled crash]
418007 Thank goodness you're all here! There's no time to lose!
41800d Whoa!
41800e Ooh...
418000 [door closes, thwack]
41800c Ugh! Hey- whoa!
418000 [door closes]
418007 Careful!
418003 What is all this?
418007 My sister Maud's gonna be here soon, and I need your help taste-testing my rock candy recipes!
418008 Uh, we're happy to help you, Pinkie Pie, but this seems like an awful lot of candy.
41800d Even for you.
418007 I may have gone a teensy bit overboard. [squee]
418000 [theme song]
418012 [groaning]
418007 Everypony ready for more?
41800c Ugh. My teeth hurt.
41800e [groans]
418008 I think we've had plenty. And shouldn't you be on your way to pick up Maud from the train station?
418007 Oh, but you've only tried half of the flavors, and we have to choose the perfect ones before she gets here so I have time to make more! [chomps]
418003 Maud is your sister. I'm sure she'll love your rock candy. And I'm pretty sure you've made enough. She's only staying for the week.
418007 Aw, it's not just for Maud, silly. I'm making candy for all of us!
4180d4 [groaning]
418007 It's part of a very important, super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share. We're going to make rock candy necklaces together! [squeals] It all started when Maud and I were fillies on the rock farm. She taught me the Pie family rock candy recipe! It adds a secret ingredient – [whispering] It's rocks! [speaking normally] – And she showed me how to string the pieces to make them into a necklace! And once we were done, we'd trade! Maud and I have been trading necklaces back and forth since I moved to Ponyville. They're a sign that we'll always be best friends! [squee]
418008 Aw, what a great tradition.
41800c Hold on. The secret ingredient is rocks?
418007 Yeah. But these are a special kind of rock that Maud discovered.
41800e Oh, what kind of a rock are they?
418007 Can't tell ya that, silly! [whispering] It's a secret! [speaking normally] Now that Maud is heading out to get her rocktorate in rock science, this may be our last chance to trade them for a really long time. I can't wait for you all to meet her. I just know that my best Ponyville friends and my best sister friend are gonna become bestest friends! We can make bestest-est friend rock candy necklaces together! She expresses herself through fashion just like Rarity, and she's really smart and loves reading just like Twilight! And she's honest, and loves forest things, and is good at games, and... Well, oh, she's awesome!
41800d [strained] She sounds amazing, but won't she start worrying if you aren't at the train station when she gets here?
418007 She sure will. [gasp] I gotta get out of here!
418000 [Tank's gyrocopter buzzing]
418028 [barking]
41800e I sure hope Maud has an appetite.
418008 Never met a pony or critter who didn't love Granny Smith's apple spiced muffins!
41800d Oh, it's no use! I simply cannot find anything suitable to wear!
41800c I doubt she'll notice what anypony's wearing, so what's the big deal?
41800d The big deal is that it will be very difficult to show Maud what a strong fashion presence we have in Ponyville if the most fashion-forward pony here can't keep her hat from falling apart!
418003 I think we're all a little nervous about Maud's visit. She's Pinkie Pie's sister, and it's obvious Pinkie really wants us to hit it off. Being able to make those rock candy necklaces together is really important to her. I'm sure everything will be fine–
418007 We're heeeere!
418003 Where's Maud?
418007 She's coming!
418000 [beat]
41800c Uh... you sure?
418007 She's not quite as fast as me. I asked Gummy to stay with her in case she got lost!
418000 [beat]
418000 [distant hoofbeats]
41800c [whispering] Is she even moving?
418007 We're over here, Maud!
418242 [sniffs] [deadpan] Hm. Sedimentary.
41800c Huh?
418242 [deadpan] This is a sedimentary rock.
418000 [beat]
418003 That's... really fascinating, isn't it, girls? We're just so thrilled you could come for a visit before your big trip. Pinkie Pie has told us so much about you. I'm Twilight, and this is Applejack, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity.
41800e We're ever so glad to meet you.
418008 We're just gonna have the best time!
418000 [beat]
41800d Pinkie Pie tells me you share my love for fashion.
418242 [deadpan] I'm really into expressing myself through my wardrobe.
41800d A-and what is the delightful frock you're wearing now saying?
418242 [deadpan] It doesn't talk. It's a dress.
41800d Oh, yes, of course, I, I just meant, the frock is, just... [splutters out]
418028 [barks]
418008 Uh, so this here's Winona. That's Owlowiscious, Tank, Opal, and Angel. Pinkie Pie told us you have a pet, too.
418242 [deadpan] He's in my pocket.
41800e Oh, you have a pocket pet? Like a tiny mouse? Or a baby bird? Or a trained butterfly?
418242 [deadpan] It's a rock. His name is Boulder.
418007 This is going to be the best, most awesome, funnest week ever! I can't wait for us all to become bestest friends!
4180d4 [nervous laughing]
418008 Maud? Would you like to try one of Granny Smith's famous apple spiced muffins?
418242 [sniffs]
418008 Oh, uh, heh, that's not– Um...
418242 [chews] [with mouth full] [deadpan] It's crunchy.
418007 [chews] [with mouth full] Maud's right! They are crunchy! Yum!
41800c So, uh, Pinkie Pie tells us you like games.
418242 [deadpan] Boulder and I sometimes play a game called 'Camouflage'. It's kind of like hide and seek but way more intense.
418000 [beat]
41800c Awesome?
418000 [rocks landing]
418003 Any luck?
41800e I truly wish I'd spent more time with Boulder, because I'm having a very hard time remembering what he looks like.
418008 It's like looking for a pebble in a haystack.
41800d More like in a pile of pebbles.
418008 Well, you don't have to make it even harder.
41800d Ugh! I give up! This is impossible!
418003 It'll hurt Maud's feelings if we all stop playing. Besides, look how much fun Pinkie Pie's having.
418007 Is this him? Is this him? Is this him? Is this him?
418003 Just a little longer, okay?
418008 Uh, alright, fine...
41800c [simultaneously] Really?
41807e [inaudible comments]
418242 [deadpan] Found him.
418007 Oh! Where was he?
418242 [deadpan] He was hiding in my pocket.
41800c Oh, come on!
418000 [Tank's gyrocopter creaking]
41800e I don't mean to interrupt, but we really should get these little critters home. It's getting awfully late, and they've had a very busy day.
418007 Maud and I had better get going too. I want her to taste the rock candy we're gonna use for our best friends necklaces! Aw, yeah!
418008 She sure is... different from what I expected.
41800c We spent all day digging in the dirt, and he was in her pocket the whole time?!
41800e On the bright side, Boulder seemed really sweet.
41800c He's a rock!
418003 Come on, girls. I'm sure Maud was just nervous about meeting all of us.
418008 Maybe she was just acting a little 'off' because she was shy or somethin'.
418003 Exactly. It must be awfully intimidating to meet all of us at once, especially since we're already such good friends.
418025 [general agreement]
418003 Maybe if we spend some time with her one-on-one to try to get to know her better, I'm sure we'll be making those best friend rock candy necklaces in no time.
41800d Where shall we start? I've chosen a few fabrics that I think will be stunning with y–
418007 Choices, choices, choices!
41800d ...Of course, if you don't see anything that speaks to you, I would be happy to suggest–
418242 [deadpan] I like this one.
41800d [laughs] Pinkie Pie didn't tell us you were so funny!
418242 [deadpan] What do you mean?
41800d Oh, well, it's just... I believe that is a dishtowel. [beat] B-b-but it does go very well with your complexion. I'm sure I could work my magic and turn it into something fabulous.
418007 Rarity and my sister working together to design something amazing! This is the best day ever!
41800d Perhaps I could sew all of these together and make you something you'd like.
418242 [deadpan] No thanks. One is enough.
418007 Doesn't Maud make the coolest scarves?
41800d Quite...
4180ad [twittering]
41800e Hello there, Hummingway. I'm ever so happy to see you.
4180ad [twittering]
418007 What's he saying?
41800e He says hello, and he's happy to see us too.
418007 I wish I could speak hummingbird. Humm! Hum-m-m-m-m, hum!
41800e [to Maud] These spiders only live in Ponyville, and even though they may look a teeny bit scary, they're actually very sweet and help keep other, more dangerous insects away!
418242 [deadpan] I was looking at the rock.
41800e Oh.
418007 Thanks again, Fluttershy! Start thinking about which flavors you want to put on your best friend rock candy necklace!
41800e Oh gosh. I'm not sure we're even friends yet.
418007 Maud is a total bookworm. She loves poetry!
418003 I've got lots of poetry. Do you read anything by Quilland Ink? Or Flourish Prose?
418242 [deadpan] I prefer to read my own poetry.
418003 Oh, I'd love to hear some of it!
418242 [clears throat] [deadpan]
418242 Rock.
418242 You are a rock.
418242 Gray.
418242 You are gray.
418242 Like a rock.
418242 Which you are.
418242 Rock.
418242 I've written thousands.
418007 She's so prolific!
418242 [deadpan] This next one is about rocks. They're all about rocks.
418242 Rocks; these are my rocks.
418243 make me sedimental.
418243 Smooth and round, asleep in the ground.
418243 Shades of brown and gray...
418008 You 'bout done peelin' them apples for the cider, Maud?
418242 [deadpan] I think this one is done.
418008 Oh, uh, yep. That's a very interestin' method you got there. [laughs nervously]
418242 [deadpan] Should I peel another?
418008 No! I mean, nah. I'm sure there's plenty apples in it already.
418007 [sniffs] Can we taste it now?
418008 Sure, why not?
418007 [glugs] Wow! That's the best apple cider I've ever had!
418008 What do you think, Maud?
418242 [sips] [deadpan] It tastes like apples.
418007 Told you she was super honest, just like you!
418008 [nervously] We're practically twins, heh.
41800c [grunts]
418000 [thud]
41800c Yeah! Let's see you beat that! Whooaa!
418000 [distant explosion]
418000 [splash]
418007 That was amazing!
41800c Whoa. How'd you do that?
418242 [deadpan] I threw it.
41800c I guess you won this one, Maud.
418242 [deadpan] I'm not really into... 'winning'.
41800c [gasps]
418007 Great, you're all here! Maud is out looking for rocks, so this is the perfect time for us to set up everything we'll need to make our best friend rock candy necklaces!
418000 [beat]
418007 What's wrong?
418003 Well, I'm not sure it's the best time to make best friend rock candy necklaces.
418007 Why not?
418003 Uh...
41800d Well, darling, you see...
41800e You're ever so thoughtful to share your special bonding ritual with us, but, uh...
418007 But what?
418008 [sighs] The truth is, we've all been tryin' real hard to get closer to Maud, but, well... maybe some ponies just don't click the way others do.
418024 [muttered agreement]
418008 We just wouldn't feel right makin' somethin' that means we're best friends if, well, we aren't.
418007 [mane deflates] Oh. Okay. If anypony needs me, I'll be in here trying to figure out what to do with two hundred pounds of rock candy.
418000 [door closes]
41800d I feel awful! Just awful...
41800e Maybe we should have just pretended we were friends with Maud.
418003 If we didn't tell Pinkie Pie that we hadn't all become the best of friends, I think Maud would have.
41800c Maybe, but who really knows? That pony is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an igneous.
41800d Don't you mean "inside an enigma"?
41800c Nope. I mean igneous. It's a kind of rock. Ask me how I know that.
418000 [knocking]
418007 I've come up with just the thing to bring everypony closer together!
418007 I call it "Pinkie-Rainbow-Rari-Twi-Apple-Flutter-Maud Fun Time"! [squee]
41800c Huh?
418007 It combines everypony's interests into one giant activity that we can all enjoy together and that will totally bring all of my bestest friends together as bestestest friends! You'll need these.
41800c Like I said - Huh?
418007 Probably better for me to show you. Watch this! Applesauce tunnel for Applejack, pretty shiny stuff for Rarity, reading material for Twilight, critter time for Fluttershy...
418000 [bear roars]
418007 Cupcakes for yours truly... [chomps] and it's a race for Rainbow Dash!
418003 Pinkie Pie, what is that?!
418007 A rock slide, of course! For Maud! First you climb, then you slide!
418008 I've got a bad feeling about this...
418007 [giggling] Huh? [straining]
418000 [rocks rumbling]
41800d [shrieks]
41800e Oh, goodness!
418007 [straining]
418008 Watch out!
418007 Huh? [shrieks] Help! [straining]
418000 [jackhammer sounds]
4180d4 [sighs]
41800c What– how– what?!
418242 Pinkie Pie, what were you thinking?
418007 I guess I wasn't.
418242 I know how important it is to you that your friends become my friends, but I just don't think it's going to happen. I think it would be best if I just go back to the rock farm and spend the rest of the week there. It was nice to meet you all. Makes me happy knowing Pinkie Pie has such good friends.
418007 But... we never even got to make our rock candy necklaces... Wait, Maud! I'll come with you!
418003 I can't believe Maud cut her trip short.
41800d I can't believe we nearly lost Pinkie Pie to that ridiculous obstacle course.
41800e Thank goodness Maud was able to reach her in time.
41800c Did you see how fast Maud moved?
41800d And the way she smashed that huge rock into dust? How in Equestria did she do that?
41800e Pinkie Pie was in trouble! Maud would move mountains for her if she had to.
418003 That's it! I think I finally realized what we all have in common with Maud! Something that just might be worthy of a very important super-duper special tradition that only the closest and bestest of friends can share!
418000 [train engine noises]
418242 Thank you for coming with me. I don't know how long I'll be gone on my rock research trip. I'm glad I still get to spend some time with you before I go.
418007 Me too. I'm sorry I put so much pressure on everypony to bond. I only wanted my friends to get to know my amazing older sister.
418007 What are you doing here?
418003 Pinkie Pie, we're so sorry we hurt your feelings by not bonding with Maud right away. And Maud, we're sorry that you felt the only way to spare Pinkie Pie's feelings was to leave Ponyville early.
418025 Mm-hm.
418008 We've seen how much you care about Pinkie Pie firsthoof.
418003 Pinkie Pie's happiness means as much to us as it does to you, and we're sorry we couldn't see it sooner. The thing that makes us click and creates a special bond between us is how much we all love Pinkie Pie!
418007 Aw, shucks!
418003 That's a pretty great thing to have in common, if you ask me. What do you think, Maud?
418242 Sure.
418000 [beat]
418007 What's wrong?
41800d Sorry, darling. I think we all just thought she'd be a bit more excited about this.
418007 Are you kidding me? I've never seen her more excited in my entire life!
418242 [deadpan] I don't know if you've noticed, but I don't show my enthusiasm for things quite in the same way my sister does.
41800c Uh, we noticed. And we're totally cool with it.
41811a [agreement]
418000 [train engine noises]
418003 Maud, we'd like to give you something to take on your trip, so that you remember all your friends from Ponyville.
418242 [deadpan] Thank you.
418007 Try not to eat all the candy before you leave! [chewing]
418003 Are those all the necklaces Pinkie Pie sent you?
418242 [deadpan] Mm-hm.
418003 You haven't eaten any of them?
418242 [deadpan] I don't really like candy. But I do love Pinkie Pie.
418007 [chewing] Mmm!
418000 [credits]
419066 I have to leave for dress rehearsal soon, Rarity! Is it finished yet?
41900d Uh, not quite. I still feel it needs a certain je ne sais quoi. Perhaps it needs... appliqués.
419066 Appliqués?
41900d Or sequins.
419066 Sequins!
419000 [crash]
41900d Sweetie Belle, I adore having you help me, truly I do, but...
419066 Guess I got a little carried away. It's just that I know how important it is for you to finish this wardrobe in time for Sapphire Shores and her backup dancers.
41900d This is without a doubt my most prestigious order ever. After all, Sapphire Shores is the pony of pop, and her Equestria-wide tour launches in Canterlot next week! Which means she must have these outfits by day after tomorrow at the latest!
419066 But is there time?
41900d Barely. But I work well under pressure. Hmm, as long as I stay calm, I'll be fine.
419066 Oh, good! Then maybe you could check the stitching and finish the buttons on the dresses I made for me, Apple Bloom, and Scootaloo? I really want them to look perfect, and... I think I need your expertise.
41900d My, you've been so much help to me. How could I possibly say no? When do you need them?
419066 Tomorrow night. For the opening night of our show!
41900d But, Sweetie Belle, darling! I, I'm behind as it is!
419066 I understand.
41900d I suppose... if I got a few more ponies to help me, then maybe...
419066 Oh, thank you thank you thank you thank you! You're the best sister ever! The dresses are right over there! [giggles]
419000 [theme song]
41905b My goodness, girls, it's time! And the audience is almost fully seated! Costumes!
419065 I can't believe Rarity still isn't here with the costumes.
419066 She's been very busy lately!
41900a But how can she still not be here? She's known about this for weeks! Uh... she has known about this for weeks, right?
419066 I kept meaning to ask her, I really did, but I worked so hard on this play. I wrote it especially for the three of us! I directed it, I'm in it, I made the costumes... It's just that this is really my time to shine doing something completely myself, and I really wanted to keep it that way!
41900a But we wanted everything to be perfect! All our friends came out to see it tonight!
41905b Places!
41900d Oh, I'm here, I'm here!
419066 [gasps] You made it!
41900d Oh, I beg your pardon for cutting it so close, but I made some improvements to your original design, and I had a terrible time with these froofy sleeves. It is for the first play you ever wrote, after all, so I made quite certain it came out just so.
41905b Places! Hello?
419000 [fanfare playing]
419000 [applause, oohs and ahhs]
419066 Forsooth and anon, I cometh forthwith and posthaste with glad tidings, miladies.
419000 [cheers]
41900a Wow! A standin' ovation!
419065 I still have goosebumps!
41900a This must be like a dream come true for you, huh, Sweetie Belle?
419065 Ooh, can you imagine if this show was how you got your cutie mark?
41900a Which do you think you'd get it for? Writing, directing, or acting?
419066 [deep breath] Let's not get carried away. We've got a whole lobby full of friends waiting to shower us with adoration and praise. Try to be gracious.
419065 Modest.
41900a Classy.
419000 [ponies chattering]
419066 Here we are, the stars of the show!
41900a You may tell us how much you loved it now.
419065 Line forms here!
419005 Wow, you guys! I think your sisters would have loved it!
41900a Would have?
419005 They're sorry, but they had to go help Rarity get Sapphire Shores' wardrobe ready to take to Canterlot in the morning.
419065 Even Rainbow Dash?
419005 Yeah. Rarity fell way behind.
41907f Aww.
419005 Aw, cheer up, the show was great! I'll get you some punch.
419066 At least everypony else who was able to stay loved it.
419000 [ponies chattering]
419066 What did you all like best? The writing, the directing, or the acting?
419098 Oh my, I- I loved the dresses.
41909e I liked some of those lines you said.
419066 Oh, really? Which ones?
41909e Uh, I don't really remember, but you were wearing a pink taffeta dress with lots of chiffon when you said them! Whoo-ee, that outfit was a dazzler!
419098 I liked that one almost as much as the one with the lacy trim and all the embroidered cuffs! [chuckles]
41909e That was a nice one too!
419066 [growls] Isn't there anypony here who remembers anything about the play besides the dresses?!
4190ec [general excuses]
419066 [noise of frustration]
41900e All of this is one headpiece?
41900d Indeed. This marvelous extravagance is the crème de la crème of the entire wardrobe! But alas, without this key hidden stitch, it's just a... I'm trying to think of a nicer way to say 'big bummer'. [sighs] Now perhaps we can all at last take a moment to relax!
419000 [door opens and closes]
41900d Whatever's the matter, Sweetie Belle? Didn't the play go all right?
419066 Not even close.
41900d Oh, dear. Was something amiss with the dresses I made you?
419066 No, they were perfect, and that was the whole problem!
41906d Huh?
41900e Oh, um, I think maybe I'll go take that moment to relax now.
41900c Heh, sure do feel like relaxing!
419008 Right behind ya!
419066 How could you?! "Oh, what amazing dresses! Oh, how I love the dresses! Ooh, dresses, dresses, dresses, dresses!"
419000 [pause]
41900d Oh, so they did like them. [chuckles] You had me worried, you silly filly.
419066 There! I knew it! You did this on purpose! Stealing the spotlight like you always do! It's my fifth birthday party all over again!
41900d The... the what now?
419066 Don't act like you don't remember. Or are you trying to prove you're a better actress than me too?!
41900d Sweetie Belle, if I did anything to upset you, then--
419066 Admit you made those dresses too good on purpose!
41900d I thought they were supposed to be good.
419066 Yes, good. Not jaw-dropping amazing!
41900d I only tried to do what I thought you wanted.
419066 Ha!
419000 [door slams]
419066 Ugh, I don't believe it. After everything I put up with all week long! [imitating Rarity] "Sweetie Belle, get me some red ribbon! No, that's not red, that's cherry! No, that's not red, that's cinnamon!" [normal, muffled] For Pete's sake, it's all red!
41900d [to Opalescence] I should probably go talk to her, hm?
419066 [muffled] At least Sapphire Shores won't be all like "Ooh, who fetched you that red ribbon? Because I don't care about anything else you made. All I care about is that amazing red ribbon!"
41900d Perhaps waiting would be best.
419000 [bedclothes rustling]
419066 Ughhh! Hgh, hgh, hgh! Nnngh! [growls] Now I can't even sleep! Happy now, big sis? [growls]
419000 [tap running]
419066 [gulping water] I wish there was a way I could take back all the work I did!
41900d [snoring]
419066 Even better. [giggles sinisterly]
419000 [muffled ponies chattering]
419000 [camera clicking]
419066 [growls] Now what?
419000 [ponies cheering]
419244 And the winner of the "Best Writer, Director, Actor in an Awesome Play Put on by a Pony and Her Awesome Best Friends" goes to...
419245 Sweetie Belle!
419000 [crowd chattering and cheering]
419000 [cameras clicking]
419000 [lightning cracks]
419000 [ponies in distress]
419000 [Wilhelm scream]
419066 Don't go!
41900d [evil laugh]
419066 Stop! Why do you have to ruin everything?!
41900d [growls]
41901a Enough!
41900d [whimpers]
419066 Princess Luna! It's really you! Or am I dreaming?
41901a What do you think?
419066 Let me see. You just rescued me from a maniacal laughing Rarity-cloud. Yeah, probably dreaming.
41901a I understand what you're going through, Sweetie Belle. I too have a sister who often shines more brightly than me, and with this, I have struggled.
419066 Wait, come back! Luna? Can you hear me? Thank you for what you did! Help, Luna! Luuuna!
419000 [series of thuds]
419000 [foals cheering]
419066 I remember this. This is my fifth birthday party! I decided to make a grand entrance. I made myself all beautiful, just like my big sister.
419000 [thud]
419066 Finally, I was perfect, and then went to the stairs to enter like the belle of the ball. When I finally came out of my room, I found the party going on without me.
419000 [foals cheering]
419066 And I kept posing at the top of the stairs, waiting to be noticed, but all I heard was...
419246 These party favors are the coolest! [blows party buzzer]
419247 Awesome! Where did you get these?
41900d Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?
419000 [foals cheering]
419247 You're the greatest, Rarity!
419248 Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?
419249 [sniffling]
419066 That's when I learned 'never try to shine with my big sister around'.
41901a But perhaps you didn't have the whole story.
419066 I thought you said you understood? Luna?
419000 [stomp]
419247 Where's Sweetie Belle?
41900d I'm sure she'll be along at any moment.
41924a [yawns] I'm tired of waiting. I say we get out of here before we all keel over from boredom. Who's with me? Poor Sweetie Belle. Nopony's gonna come to another one of her parties after this fiasco.
41900d Don't go! You'll miss out on the, uh, party favors! I was going to save them 'til the end, but...
419246 These party favors are the coolest! [blows party buzzer]
419247 Awesome? Where did you get these?
41900d Made them myself. And of course, you'll all want cake, won't you?
419000 [foals cheering]
419248 Who needs a birthday girl when you've got the birthday girl's amazing big sister?
419249 [sniffling]
41900d Oh, no-no-no. All of these things were Sweetie Belle's idea. I just assisted with the execution.
419066 I guess Rarity wasn't trying to steal the spotlight. She was trying to save my party. Luna? Luna!
419000 [splash]
419000 [dolphins squeaking]
41900d Should I hem the cloaks now or wait until I'm there? I could hem them now, but I might have to redo them...
419066 When was this?
41900d But if I wait until I'm in Canterlot to hem them, Sapphire Shores might not get the best first impression...
419066 Wait. This must've happened earlier tonight!
41900d Ooh... Sapphire Shores is such a big star and such a stickler for details. What if everything's not perfect enough?
419066 Funny, I thought I was the only one who got worried about stuff like that.
41900d Oh, buck up, Rarity, stop this foolishness. You've done your best and left nothing to chance! All that's needed now is a good night's rest.
419000 [click]
419066 [sighs] I hope everything goes alright for her tomorrow.
41901a Hm. How curious you should say that.
419000 [door opens]
41901a Go. Go see what the future holds if you fail to rein in your worst instincts, as I once did.
41900d And here it is! The crème de la crème--
419066 Noooo!
41900d The piéce de resistance...
419066 Don't! [gasps]
41924b [oohing] [gasping]
41900d The headdress!
419089 Looks like I made a mistake here.
41900d But, but this is impossible! I, I, I checked and rechecked everything! This couldn't have happened!
419089 You sure about that, honey?
41900d Please, you must believe me!
419066 Listen to my sister!
41924c [laughing]
41900d [crying]
419066 [screams] I don't wanna see any more!
41900d Always check and recheck!
419089 Who all wants to hear a funny story about my ex-costume designer?
419000 [ponies laughing]
41900d Check, recheck, recheck, then recheck!
419066 Make it stop! Princess Luna, can you hear me?!
41900e Make me a dress, Rarity, please?
41900d Go away! You know I don't do that anymore!
419000 [door slams]
419066 Wake me up, Princess Luna! Wake me up, WAKE ME UP!
419066 [gasping]
419000 [door opens]
419066 Rarity? [gasps] Oh no! The box is... gone? I'm too late! SHE LEFT FOR CANTERLOT!
419000 [train engine noises]
419066 The key is for you two to distract Rarity long enough for me to put the stitch back in without her noticing.
419065 If we're not too late already.
41900a Oh, my gosh! I can't believe we're goin' to see Sapphire Shores! I'm such a huge fan! I know all her songs!
419065 'Get Your Pony On'!
41900a Ooh, that's one of my favorites!
419066 This isn't a trip to see Sapphire Shores! It's a trip to save my sister from a horrible future!
419065 'Serves Her Right'!
419066 [gasps] How can you say that?! Rarity doesn't deserve that at all!
419065 No, 'Serves Her Right' is another one of Sapphire Shores' songs!
41900a You seriously didn't know that? Don't you listen to her music?!
419066 ...I prefer show tunes.
41907f Ugh.
419000 [pounding music]
419089 Five, six, seven eight, ba-bam!
41900d Oh, bravo! Fabulous! Magnifique!
419089 One more time, from the top. Let's not embarrass me in front of my favorite designer this time? And a-one, two, three, four!
419066 But you have to let us in! I'm Sapphire Shores' designer's sister! You have to believe us!
41924d Kid, the only thing I have to do is make sure Sapphire Shores doesn't get interrupted all day by fans like you.
419066 But I'm not a fan!
41900a I am!
419065 Me too!
419066 Not helping!
41924b [panting]
419089 Now, that's how I like it! You rocked it, girls! Get some water and be back in ten. Rar-i-ty, come on up here and show me what you brought me. Sapphire wants to see it and to love it!
419065 [straining] Almost...
419000 [crash]
419065 Oof!
419066 We've gotta get in there, now!
419089 Okay then. Liking what I see so far. So is this the whole shebang?
41900d Actually, I saved the best for last!
419080 [screaming]
41900d And here it is!
419000 [thudding]
419066 You gotta see this with the cinnamon ribbon! You'll love it!
41900d Sweetie Belle?!
419089 You know her?
41900d Uh... [laughs nervously] Ahem. Just a moment!
419000 [door opens]
419000 [crash]
419000 [door closes]
419066 Oh, good! This is just a dream!
41901a Actually, no. This is very much real.
419066 [sighs] Oh, Luna... I wish none of this ever happened... What am I gonna do?
41901a Let's begin with this. And I think I know how you can even improve it.
419000 [door opens]
41900d I would like to know what in the wide, wide realm of Equestria this stunt of yours is all about, and I want to know now! Do you have any idea how important this job is to me?
419066 Actually, I do. I was upset at you for stealing the spotlight from me at the play, so I pulled out the center stitch to the headpiece so it would fall apart.
41900d What?!
419066 But then I realized I didn't want your future to be ruined forever and ever, so I came back to change it before it was too late. So... here it is. It's all fixed. Please forgive me.
41900d Wait... what is this?
419066 Trust me. Sapphire Shores is gonna love it.
419089 Rarity, this isn't going to work out. You don't get to my level of success without learning to read the signs, and this situation has bad luck written all over it.
41900d I promise you'll absolutely adore the headdress as soon as you see it.
419089 My, it is attractive, but...
419066 Look at the stitching, real close.
419089 Well, I'll be. It's a dolphin! That's my lucky animal! They swim with me in my dreams.
41900d Wherever did you come up with the idea for a dolphin?
419066 Oh, it just came to me... in a dream. I'm sorry I got jealous about those dresses. I know now that you were only trying to help.
41900d Oh, Sweetie, I forgive you! But I never did get to see your play. Any chance I could catch an encore performance?
419066 Uh, I don't think the play went all that good. To be honest, the costumes were the best part.
41900d Awww!
419000 [credits]
420000 [splashing]
42000a Just one more time? Please?
420008 Alright, but this is the last one.
42000a Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Woooo!
420000 [splash]
420009 [spluttering] Who done that?!
42000a Sure wish you'd come swim with us, Granny.
420009 Uh, sorry, dear. I just can't bring myself anywhere near that there swimmin' hole.
42000a How come?
420009 Well, I wasn't always this way...
420000 [telecine beeping]
420009 Time was, I was an aquapony all-star! In fact, I was the only Apple to ever come close to breaking the Equestria high-diving record! Falling six stories into a deep dish pie pan takes a toll on the hindquarters. Oh, I was so sore, took years before I could even look at the water again! Just the idea of swimmin' makes my whole body ache! Besides, these old legs can't even paddle fast enough to stay afloat.
420000 [splash]
420009 [panicked noises]
42000a Boy, I sure would hate to be afraid of swimmin'. You think I'll ever be scared of the water?
420000 [Jaws-theme BGM]
42000a Aah!
420026 Nope.
42024e [laughing]
420000 [theme song]
42000a Wow, Granny. I can't believe you were a high diver!
420009 The best one in Ponyville!
42000a Do you think I could be a high diver?
420026 Nope.
420008 Absolutely not.
42000a But–
420009 Now you hold your horsefeathers, little seed! I never said bein' a high diver was a smart decision! It's incredibly dangerous!
42000a I know, but–
420009 But nothin'! It is the riskiest, scariest, darn-fool thing I ever did do! That's not to say I didn't wish I was still young and spry and confident, but let's leave the flyin' through the air to the Pegasi.
42000a Wow, when you put it that way, it doesn't sound so fun.
420000 [ponies talking]
420008 Wow. I wonder where everypony's headed.
420000 [distant fairground music]
420008 Now where in Ponyville do you two think you're goin'?
420009 Aw, quit bein' such a worry-worm and follow your ears!
42000a Come on, Applejack, aren't you curious?
420000 [fairground music gets closer]
420000 [ponies chattering]
420000 [crank turning]
420000 [steam puffing]
420146 Thank you, one and all, for your attendance, and we guarantee that your time here will not be spent in vain!
420145 In fact, we think it will prove to be the most valuable time you've ever spent!

420145 [Flam]
420145 A sickness that lies waiting there in every breath you breathe
420146 [Flim]
420146 Disease will up and grab you as it crawls from land and sea
420145 [Flam]
420145 It's amazing how infected that the natural world and all its things can be
420146 Now I understand that some of you don't think you're sick.
420145 But twisted hooves and aching joints don't heal all that quick.
420146 Consider just how dangerous this world is! You might...
420145 [Flam]
420145 Slip and fall, break or sprain something here tonight
420000 [Flim and Flam]
420000 But luckily for you, we've got the thing you need
420000 And it's easier when all you need's the cure
420000 The Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic
420000 Is just what the doctor ordered, I'm sure
420146 Now I know our claims seem fantastical.
420145 Impractical.
420146 Improbable.
420145 Impossible.
420147 And magical!
420146 So we welcome every suffering pony to make their way up to the stage.
420145 Now don't crowd.
420146 And we'll prove our tonic's effectiveness before your very eyes.

420000 Of the Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic
42024f [Silver Shill]
42024f I won't need these crutches to dance out the door
420009 Now how do ya like that?
420008 I don't. There's somethin' funny about this whole thing.
420146 [Flim]
420146 Now some of you may suffer from feelings of despair
420146 You're old, you're tired, your legs won't work, there's graying in your hair
420145 [Flam]
420145 Just listen and I'll tell you that you don't need to fear
420145 Your ears will work, your muscles tone, your eyes will see so clear
4200ec [Crowd]
4200ec Luckily for us, you've got the thing we need
4200ec The answer to our problems in a jar
4200ec The Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic
4200ec Is the greatest ever miracle by far!
420000 [in background]
420000 Tonic... tonic... tonic...
420146 It cures the reins, the spurs, and the Clydesdale fur blight.
420145 Hooferia and horsentery cured in just a night.
420146 You've got swollen hooves and hindquarters or terrible bridle-bit cleft.
420145 Saunter sitz and gallop plop will give your tail some heft.
420146 Mane loss, hay fever, or terrible tonsillitis.
420145 You heard it here, folks -- this is the only place in all of Equestria you'll find it!
420146 [Flim]
420146 It can make you shorter, taller, or even grow old
420145 [Flam]
420145 But who'd want that?
420146 [Flim]
420146 When with one drink
420000 [Flim and Flam]
420000 You can be young again–
420009 SOLD!
420146 Congratulations, Granny Smith! You just made the purchase of a lifetime!
420008 Are you as worried as I am?
420026 Eeyup.
420000 [splash]
42000a Boy, I just can't believe all the things that Flim Flam Tonic can do!
420008 When somepony says somethin's too good to be true, it usually is.
42000a You mean Granny wasted her money?
420008 Well, I don't know about that, but I don't think there's a tonic in Equestria that can make an old pony young again.
420009 Howdy!
42000a Granny?!
420008 Hang on now! We'll get ya!
420000 [splash]
420008 [grunts]
420000 [splash]
42000a Granny, I thought you were too afraid of the water to swim! And, and what about your hip?!
420009 Well, I reckon it might have been a problem before I had myself a dose of that there Flim Flam Tonic!
420008 I'm not so sure that tonic really does anythin'.
420009 Doesn't do anythin'?! What d'you call this? [hums a tune]
420008 I'm glad you're feelin' good, but how do you know it's from the tonic?
420009 I looked out at the water this mornin' and I felt the same terrifyin' aches and pains I always do. But one sip of that magic elixir and it all went away! Why, I might even get a head start on my chores! What do you say, Big Mac-a-doo? Up for a little afternoon applebuckin'?
420026 Uh, no.
420009 Oh, quit your bellyachin'!
42000a Gee, it looks like that tonic works after all! I wonder what's in it.
420008 I think maybe it's time we found out.
420000 [Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic in background]
42000a So you're just gonna walk up and ask them how it works?
420008 I guess. Though if it's a genuine cure, I don't suppose they'll be too keen on sharin' the recipe.
42024f [Silver Shill]
42024f –out the door!
42000a Wait a second! That's that same pony from before!
420008 Hey!
420000 [thudding]
420008 Now hold it right there, Mister...?
42024f Shill. Silver Shill. Ooh, what do you two want?
420008 Our Granny took some tonic and we want to know how it works.
42000a Granny couldn't swim before, and now she can. Just like you couldn't walk and now you can. But what are you doin' back here? I mean, if the tonic cured you and all...
42024f [gulps]
420008 ...Because he's part of the act! It's time for you to tell the truth! You never needed crutches at all, did ya?
42024f I, uh...
420000 [whistles blowing]
420008 Hey! Huh?
420146 Well, if it isn't our most favorite Apple!
420145 What brings you back to our humble abode?
420008 You two charlatans sold my Granny a bottle of tonic, and now she's off actin' like a filly again.
420146 What's so bad about that?
420008 If she keeps gallavantin' around like a yearlin', she's apt to drop from exhaustion or worse! What's more, I know for a fact that your friend here is dressin' up as a different pony every night so he can pretend to be cured!
420145 Well, well, well, that's quite an accusation.
420146 But let's say that it's true...
420145 Hypothetically...
420146 Theoretically...
420145 As I understand, your Granny was a famous aquapony.
420146 The star of the show, once upon a time.
420145 But hasn't set so much as a hoof in the water since.
420008 Until today, that's right.
420146 Well, then even if our tonic were nothing more than a mixture of apple juice and beet leaves...
420145 Hypothetically...
420146 Theoretically...
420145 The fact is that Granny is happier now than before she tried it.
420008 I guess...
420146 So, the question is...
420145 Do you really want to be the pony who takes all that happiness away?
420008 I...
42000a There you are! I've been lookin' all over! Did you find out what's in the tonic?
420008 Honestly, Apple Bloom... as long as it works, I... don't suppose it really matters.
42000a Well, if it doesn't matter to you, then it doesn't matter to me either, sis.
420146 That's the spirit!
420145 Come back anytime!
420000 [splashing]
42000a Hey, Granny! Think you can buck me over the water?
420009 I don't see why not! Come on, Big Mac, toss her this way!
420008 Granny, wait!
420009 Woo-hoo-hoo!
4201e3 [laughing]
420009 Uh, what were you sayin', dear?
420008 Granny, don't you think you should take it kinda easy?
420009 I've been takin' it easy for too long! And now, thanks to that Flim Flam Tonic, I don't have to!
420000 [splash]
42000a Granny, you think I could be an aquapony like you?
420009 Of course you can, sapling. There's nothin' to it but to do it!
42000a Well, the Ponyville swim meet is comin' up. We could enter together! A legendary water pony like you? We'd be a cinch to win!
420009 Mm, ee, uh, I don't know... Bein' back in the water is one thing, but a competition is a pony of a different color.
42000a Oh. Okay.
420008 I don't know, Granny. A swim meet sounds pretty safe. And after all, if that tonic lets you swim in a river and a swimmin' hole, a pool should be no problem at all.
420009 Well, I'll be a tart turnover, you are right! All we need now is more tonic!
420000 [ponies chattering]
420145 Welcome, friends, and step right up! The next show starts in five minutes!
420146 But why not buy your tonic now and avoid the rush?
420145 Right this way, good sir!
420009 We'll take the whole case!
420000 [bits clinking]
420250 Are you saying this stuff actually works?
420008 It seems to work for Granny.
420146 You heard it here first, folks! Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic is Granny Smith-tested and Applejack-approved!
420250 If Applejack says it works, that's good enough for me!
420000 [ponies chattering excitedly]
420000 [bits clinking]
420008 [sigh]
420000 [splash]
420000 [ponies clapping and cheering]
420000 [splashing]
4201e3 Hoo-ha, hee-hee, ha-hoo-ha!
420008 Just remember, you two. The most important thing is to be safe and have fun, right?
420009 Fiddlesticks! With the routine we've been workin' on, I'll be a plum puddin' if we don't win this thing!
420008 Uh... good luck, then!
420009 Luck? Pfft, who needs luck? We got tonic on our side!
420145 Flim Flam's Magical Curative Tonic!
420146 Get your Applejack-approved tonic! Granny Smith drinks it – why shouldn't you?
420000 [ponies cheering]
420008 [sighs] Right.
420009 Now, if'n you'll excuse us, we got some swimmin' to do!
420000 [splashing]
420000 [ponies cheering]
420008 Well, I'll be...
420000 [cameras clicking]
420251 That was some of the most amazing aquabatics I've ever seen! How in Equestria did you do it? Hard work? Lots of practice? [clicks camera]
420009 Yeah, but mostly it's the tonic!
420146 That's Flim Flam Miracle Curative Tonic, to be precise.
420145 Buy it now while supplies last.
420000 [ponies chattering]
420008 What are you doin' here?
42024f Oh, things are going so well, Flim and Flam gave me a promotion! Just made my first bit as a salespony. No more costumes for this pony. [beat] This is more of a uniform.
420008 If you say so.
42024f I used to wonder if I was doing the right thing. You know, pretending to be cured, basically lying to folks about this tonic. But thanks to you, I realized that sometimes honesty isn't the best policy.
420008 Thanks to... me?
42000a With Flim Flam's magical Curative Tonic, my Granny can do anything! Just ask Applejack!
420000 [cameras clicking]
420008 No! This has gotta stop! If ponies keep believin' that tonic can do things it can't, who knows what'll happen?
42024f Maybe something like that?
420008 [gasps] Granny! What in blazes does she think she's doin'?!
42000a Granny's gonna break the Equestria high divin' record!
420008 Land sakes! [catching breath] [gasps]
420000 [whip cracking noises]
420009 [yelps] Now what in tarnation did you do that for?!
420008 That was the most fool-pony thing I've ever seen anypony do in all my life! You can't do a dive like that!
420009 Oh, quit your fussin'! I had enough tonic to do a dive ten times as high!
420146 Twenty times, by my count.
420145 Thirty, with a favorable breeze.
420008 I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
420000 [crowd gasps]
420250 But you gave it your stamp of approval!
42005a Are you saying you lied?
420008 ...I am.
420000 [crowd gasps]
420008 I didn't mean to! But everypony seemed so much happier, I couldn't bring myself to tell you when I found out the tonic wasn't real. I know it was wrong. I just hope, with time, I can win back everypony's trust.
42000a But if the tonic is a fake, then how come Granny can swim again, and what about all that aquabatics stuff we just did?
420008 I reckon sometimes you can forget what you're capable of, and it just takes a little extra confidence to remember that it was inside of you all along. But tellin' ponies your tonic can do things it can't is just wrong!
420146 But you just said it boosts confidence!
420145 And that's not all it does, folks–
42024f Yes, it is! In fact, it's not a tonic at all! I know, 'cause I helped make it! Watching Applejack save Granny and then admit to lying, well, that made me realize I was making ponies believe in a thing that just wasn't so!
420008 Believin' in somethin' can help you do amazin' things. But if that belief is based on a lie, eventually it's gonna lead to real trouble.
42024f Thank you, Applejack. I got this through dishonest means. That was a mistake I won't be making again! I'd like you to have it, as a reminder of how you helped me finally see the truth.
420008 I don't know...
42024f Oh, don't worry. I'll track down the pony I sold that worthless tonic to and give him another bit to replace this one! Honest.
420008 I'm sorry, Granny. I hope this doesn't mean you'll stop swimmin'.
420009 Why in tarnation would I do that? I just can't believe those two salesponies had me believin' I could near fly! Hey, where'd they go?
420008 Bein' honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about. But I think believin' a lie can end up hurtin' even more. Maybe some ponies don't care about that – but I sure ain't one of them. Now you take it easy there, Granny!
420009 Oh, I plan to! Hoo, ha, ha-whee!
420000 [splash]
42000a [laughing]
420000 [credits]
421003 [reading] The magical properties of this spell will only have lasting effects if you focus on—
42100c Yeah! [laughs]
421003 No! Rainbow Dash! [grunts] How in Equestria does that pony expect to pass her history of the Wonderbolts exam tomorrow if she's wasting time flying?! I'm just gonna fly right up to her and tell her what I think about her lackadaisical approach to studying! Won't she be surprised!
42100c Surprise!
421003 What? Huh? How did you—
42100c Puh-lease, Twilight. That was the worst sneak attack ever.
421003 Wha? But—
42100c I saw you giving me the stink-eye from the ground and heard you flying towards me and muttering from a mile away.
421003 Well, if you heard me "muttering", then you must know what I was "muttering" about.
42100c Yeah, yeah, the Wonderbolts history test. No big deal.
421003 No. Big deal. Really big deal. It's a test! A test that will determine if you can join the newly-formed Wonderbolts Reserves, and being part of the Wonderbolts Reserves means you'll have the opportunity to live your dream as a Wonderbolt! This is the most important test of your life!
42100c Twilight, not everypony gets all freaked out about tests like you.
421003 I do not get "all freaked out" about tests!
42100c Uh, seriously? Your freakouts are so epic, you sing whole freakout arias about freaking out.
421003 Fine, I may tend to take my tests a little seriously, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be studying for yours! Oooh! And I know just the pony who can help you - me! This is gonna be so much fun!
421000 [teleporting noises]
42100c Sure. Fun.
421000 [theme song]
421000 [thud]
42100c [yelps] Wha– huh?
421003 This is the most complete—
42100c And ginormous!
421003 —book on the history of the Wonderbolts.
42100c Okay, but how am I supposed to get what's in there into here?
421003 With my handy-dandy study checklist, of course!
42100c Of course.
421003 First up, reading and highlighting. Reading and highlighting is the foundation of any good study method. It allows the student to hone in and boil down on what's really important, separating the good from the bad, the wheat from the chaff, getting to the crux of things. Let's see what you've got so far!
42100c Um...
421003 Huh? Hm, by highlighting everything, you don't really separate the wheat from the chaff... Or the good from the bad. Hey, I am not that tall!
42100c [giggles]
421003 [sighs] Okay, Rainbow, clearly reading and highlighting is not your style of studying, so let's move on to the tried and true - History lecture! Yes, Rainbow?
42100c Is it snack time?
421003 No.
42100c Recess?
421003 No.
42100c [sighs] Can't we just watch the history of the Wonderbolts movie?!
421003 No! Now, just get comfortable, and experience the magic of learning. Ahem. Prior to the great Celestia/Luna rift, there was no need for the Earth, Unicorn, Pegasi, or E.U.P., Guard.
42100c [sighs]
421000 [stool creaks and thuds]
421003 But after Luna's banishment, the Protective Pony Platoons were formed. On the anniversary of the first Celestial year of peace, a celebration was held.
421000 [stool continues creaking]
4210c3 [starts hooting, continues under]
421005 [starts drumming, continues under]
421003 Headed by General Firefly, an elite team of aerial performers were chosen to help celebrate this auspicious occasion. The first performance was so full of energy, so highly charged, that magical lightning showered down on the crowd. Everypony was so filled with amazement and wonder that General Firefly dubbed them "the Wonderbolts"!
421000 [Spike and Owlowiscious stop; stool continues creaking]
421003 Rainbow Dash, can you repeat any of my lesson?
421000 [stool creaks]
421000 [thud]
421000 [horn honks]
42100c [snorts, laughs]
421000 [cards rustling]
421003 History lecture... nope. [sighs] Okay, Rainbow– Rainbow? Rainbow Dash!
42100c Here!
421003 Let's move on to my favorite style of learning - flashcards!
42100c Oh, does that mean I'll learn in a flash?
421003 One can only hope. [inhales] Colonel Purple Dart, the leader of the Wonderbolts in the Fourth Celestial Era, was known for his– wha?! Rainbow! Did you see what happened?
42100c What? No! I was... riveted by your captivating cards!
421003 Hmm... After becoming the official flying squadron for Princess Celestia, she honored them with– Gotcha!
42100c Got what?
421000 [beat]
421003 The original Wonderbolts lightning bolt insignia was– [yelps] Rainbow Dash, you could've hurt me!
42100c With a spit wad? Really?
421003 A spit wad to the eye would have been no laughing matter!
421000 [snap]
421003 Well, if you can horse around like this, then you clearly must be ready for the test.
42100c Clearly.
421003 Well then, I guess you're also ready for a...
421000 [teleporting noise]
421003 Pop quiz!
42100c Bring it!
421000 [teleporting noise]
421003 The initials E.U.P. stand for what?
42100c Ernie's undercooked pancakes.
421003 The original aerial team performed for...?
42100c Celestia's cereal celebration.
421003 The Wonderbolts were given their name by this famous Pegasus. Who is she? [to herself] Please don't say Colonel Waffle...
42100c Hello? General Blazing Donut Glaze! [scoffs] So, did I ace it or what?
421003 Or what. You didn't get one answer correct.
42100c What? But– but how?
421003 I don't know. I've never heard answers so wrong! And so breakfast-related!
42100c [stomach growls]
421003 If you had taken the official test today...
42100c [gasps] My dreams of being in the Wonderbolts Reserve would have been totally crushed! [gasps] What am I gonna do? I'm running out of time! I don't know any of this history! I'm gonna fail!
421000 [door opens]
42100c I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna fail! And it's all your fault!
421003 My fault?! I'm the one helping you!
42100c Maybe your famous study methods aren't all they're cracked up to be, eh, teacher?!
421003 Excuse me, I've used them to study for many a test and passed!
42100c Yeah, right.
421003 Do you know the name of the premiere Wonderbolts choreographer?
42100c Uh, well—
421003 Commander Easyglider. Do you know how many Pegasi flew in the original squad?
42100c Um—
421003 Seven! Do you know Princess Celestia's favorite flight pattern?! The Icaranian Sun Salutation! See? I could pass the test.
42100c Fine! Rub it in, why don't ya? Besides, I don't see why I have to take this lousy test anyway. I've proven I'm one of the best flyers around.
421003 Knowing their origin and being able to properly represent them for all of Equestria is just as important.
42100c Yeah, right. Some history buff like you must have made that up to bring us flyers down.
421003 Knowing history actually is beneficial, Rainbow.
42100c [blows raspberry] Beneficial for eggheads!
42100e Girls.
421003 Well, this egghead knows history and can fly. Maybe I should become a Wonderbolt.
42100c Just 'cause you've got wings, doesn't mean you can fly!
42100e Girls!
42100c You're barely able to just get off the ground!
421003 [gasps]
42101b [grunts]
42100e Girls! Stop! Now, is that any way to talk to a friend?
421003 Sorry.
42100c Yeah, sorry.
42100e Don't you have more important things to do? Like prepare Rainbow for her big test?
421003 I've tried everything, Fluttershy, but none of my study methods work for her.
42100e Well, no offense to your teaching methods, Twilight, but I think I may have a way to help Rainbow.
42100c Oh, who's that, who's that?
42100e Celestia and Luna, back when they were happy.
42106a [mewls]
421000 [Tank's gyrocopter buzzing]
42100c Uh... now what?
42100e Gummy's an Earth pony, Winona's a unicorn, and Tank is a Pegasus.
421003 They're the E.U.P., helping to protect the Princess.
42100c Uh, how are you getting all this?
421000 [crunch]
42100e Oh, no!
421000 [various thuds and crunches]
42100c Stop, stop, stop! That was aw—
421007 Awesome! I give it three woohoo's! Woohoo, woohoo, woohoo! And an extra "woo" for good measure! Woo!
42100c Well, I give it a "whoa, whoa, what?" I'm totally confused and I just wanna go home... Whoa– hey!
421007 Whoa your woes there, woeful. Some ponies learn through theatrical presentation, but other ponies learn through musical intervention.
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421000 [beatboxing, turntable scratching noises]
421000 Well, back in ancient times, there were the Wonderbolts of old
421000 A general named Firefly, amazing and so...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Bold!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 She brought them all together, spreading unity...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 In flight!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Performing at their very best with wonder...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 And with might!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 There's Admiral Fairweather and the Colonel Purple...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Dart!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Gave Wonderbolts a bit of steel along with...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Lots of heart!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 An admiral named Fairy Flight and general called...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Flash!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Helped the 'bolts fly super high...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 With style and panache!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Commander Easyglider was the real cream of...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 The crop!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 For with her wicked moves, the Wonderbolts...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Soared to the top!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Huh!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Wonderbolts, yeah! Wonderbolts...
421000 [Pinkie Pie, Goldengrape, and Dr Hooves]
421000 Unh!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 That is my rappin' history of the Wonderbolts!
421007 So, d'you get it?
42100c Yes, Pinkie Pie! [poorly imitating rap-style sounds] General This and Colonel That, they're the Wonderbolts, something that rhymes with that!
421007 That... was pretty terrible.
42100c What?! No... really? But I've gotta learn this stuff! Now!
42100d And I am just the pony to help!
42100c Rarity, you look ridiculous.
42100d I am going to ignore that comment out of my desire to help you.
42100c Good luck.
42100d Get ready, Rainbow Dash, for I am going to take you on an historical adventure in fashion! I am now modeling the rather unattractive, and frankly itchy, original Wonderbolts flying costume. Fortunately, thanks to the vision of Flair d'Mare, the Wonderbolts ensemble became more streamlined in a wonderfully breathable fabric. Of course, there were fashion hits... and misses. Just look at those dreadful bell-bottoms. What were ponies thinking?
421007 I dunno. I bet General Flash rocked these thangs!
42100c [yelps] Pinkie, you're real!
421007 Of course I'm real! I mean I'm not the real General Flash, the tenth leader of the Wonderbolts, but I, Pinkie, am really real.
42100e And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight, from the seventh squadron.
421003 And of course you recognize Commander Easyglider.
421008 And I'm sportin' some sort of getup worn by Colonel Purple Dart.
42100c [panicked breathing]
42100d Just look at us.
421003 Look at us.
421007 Look at me!
42100c It's too much for my eyes!
421008 Now, don't you fret, Rainbow. This fashion show nonsense wouldn't help me learn nothin', either.
421000 [beat]
42100c Really? Well, what special study trick do you have, AJ?
421008 Who, me? Oh, I got nothing.
42100c [sighs]
421008 Why, I could tell you every little thing there is to know about the history of apples, but I picked all that up over years in the field as a labor of love. How much time you got?
42100c Twelve hours.
421008 Oh, then you are up a creek.
421003 Oh, I think we should just go back to old-fashioned studying.
42100e What about our play?
42100d Just look at these costumes! Surely something resonates with your inner Wonderbolt!
421008 And Granny Smith discovered the first granny smith in Fillydelphia, when she was just a filly!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Commander Easyglider was the real cream of the crop—
421003 Pinkie, stop rapping! That isn't gonna help Rainbow!
421007 [Pinkie Pie]
421007 Well, I suggest you put down your silly cards of flash,
421007 For I know that they cannot help our good friend Rainbow Dash!
42111a [arguing]
42100c Enough! No rapping, no cards, no costumes, no play, and no apples! I am never gonna pass this test, ever! Just forget it!
421003 [panting] Rainbow, I'm sorry about all that! We didn't mean to overwhelm you!
42100c It's okay. You were just trying to help. It's just too bad I'm too dumb to learn anything.
421003 You are not dumb! You just learn differently!
42100c If by "differently" you mean "not at all", then you're totally right.
421003 No, that's totally wrong.
42100c See? Wrong again.
421003 I don't know anypony that's read more Daring Do books than you.
42100c Well, that's not going to get me into the Wonderbolts.
421003 And your knowledge of jokes and pranks is only rivaled by Pinkie.
42100c Great. My years of being a class clown prevented me from actually learning how to learn!
421003 That's not what I meant. You're smart, creative, inventive, and– ugh! Hey! I know you're upset, but you don't need to—
421000 [Rainbow Helicopter blades whirring]
421003 Whoa... I almost slammed into that!
42100c I know. You were jabbering on so much you didn't even notice.
421003 But how did you notice? You were listening and talking to me the whole time!
42100c Ha-hah, you're such a rookie. An experienced flyer like me knows how to multitask.
421003 While you fly?
42100c It's essential! Yes, I was paying attention to you, but was also scanning the sky and the ground for any problems.
421003 Really?
42100c Flying's not just flying!
421000 [sound of VHS rewinding]
42100c In order to stay safe in the sky, I've got to hear and see everything down to the littlest details. For instance, I saw Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo come out of Sugarcube Corner, and from the looks of it, they had carrot cupcakes with sprinkles. And I'm thinking Big Mac sold a huge order of apples to Filthy Rich, 'cause I heard him give a very hearty—
421252 "Eeyup".
42100c I always make note of everything when I fly. No biggie.
421003 [gasps] Oh, my gosh!
42100c What?
421003 Gotta go!
42100c Yeah, I get it. I wouldn't want to hang out with a loser like me either. [sad groan]
421000 [thunder rumbles]
421003 Thanks for meeting me, everypony.
421008 What is it, Twilight?
421003 We have to help Rainbow Dash.
421000 [telescope creaks]
42100e Yes, but how?
42100d We've tried every kind of studying. My way, your way...
421003 But we haven't tried Rainbow Dash's way.
421007 Hmm, I'm intrigued.
421000 [records scratching]
421003 Okay. Listen up, ponies, here's the plan. [unintelligible whispering]
421003 Hey, Rainbow. Wanna go for a fly?
42100c [sighs] Sure. Got nothing better to do. Didn't we just do this?
421003 Yes, but like you said, I'm such a newbie, I need all the practice I can get.
42100c Yeah, well, I'm sure you'll become a great flyer in no time. After all, you're good at everything.
421003 So... what's going on?
42100c Oh, nothing. Just getting my dreams crushed.
421003 Uh... read any good books lately?
42100c [sighs] Just history books. I'd tell you what they were about, but my brain is as dry as a rock.
421003 Speaking of rocks, did you know Pinkie Pie grew up on a rock farm? [short nervous laugh]
42100c Maybe I'll go work there as I have no other plans for the rest of my life.
421003 Oh, come on now, Rainbow. You can't give up on your dream!
42100c Seems my dream has given up on me. Maybe I'll learn to shine shoes, sell hats, dig ditches...
421003 Or maybe you'll be a Wonderbolt.
42100c Twilight, give it up! I have.
421003 So, what do you remember about that flight?
42100c [sighs] Nothing important. Except after Luna was banished to the moon, Celestia needed protective forces, so Earth, unicorn, and Pegasi formed the E.U.P. Guard of the Protective Pony Platoons.
421003 Yes...?
42100c [getting happier] And, at the celebration of the first Celestial year of peace, an elite flying squadron performed, headed by General Firefly, who later named the group the Wonderbolts!
421003 Uh-huh...?
42100c Commander Easyglider established flight choreography that is still used by the Wonderbolts today!
421003 Yes!
42100c I... I know the history! I know it all! But how in Equestria did that happen?
421003 You learned it!
42100c Yeah, I got that! But how?
421003 Well, on our first flight, I discovered that you catalog everything that happens all around you when you're flying, without even thinking about it! Don't you see?
421000 [sound of VHS rewinding]
421003 I made use of your special skills by enlisting everypony to help you learn the history of the Wonderbolts!
42100e I, Princess Celestia, banish you, Princess Luna, to the moon.
42100d Noooooo!
42100a Earth!
421066 Unicorn!
421065 Pegasus!
42100a E!
421066 U!
421065 P!
421026 Eeyup!
42100e Let us celebrate our first Celestial year of peace!
421007 Yeah, let's party! I'm General Firefly! Gee, my costume is itchy and unattractive, but I'm gonna assemble an awesome flying team!
421000 [cannon exploding]
421007 I'll call them... the Wonderbolts!
42100d Streamlined style by Flair d'Mare!
421253 Admiral Fairweather!
421254 Colonel Purple Dart!
4210f9 Admiral Fairy Flight!
421255 General Flash!
421256 Commander Easyglider!
42100e The history of the Wonderbolts!
42100c Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh! Thank you! Thank you all so much!
421003 You're welcome, but it all came from you. You learned without knowing you're learning. Your main focus is flying, but then your brain is also absorbing lots of other information! It's actually really brilliant!
42100c Ha, I always knew I was brilliant!
421012 [laughing]
421003 Rainbow Dash finally learned the history of the Wonderbolts, but she's not the only pony that needed a lesson; I needed to learn something just as important. One way of learning isn't better than another. After all, every pony is unique and individual.
421000 [papers rustling]
421000 [stamping]
42100c Yeeeaah! Whoo!
421000 [credits]
422007 [squeals] Yes! Best day ever! We're all going to the Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange! And not just going – we're accompanying a princess on an official royal duty!
422003 Please, it's not that big of a deal. There always has to be a princess at the Exchange. Last year was Princess Cadance, this year it's me. It's just a formality. I'm sure none of the other ponies will even notice I'm here.
422000 [crowd cheering]
422257 Wow, look over there, a princess!
422258 Oh, this is amazing!
422008 Could be wrong, but I think they might've noticed.
422003 [laughs nervously]
422000 [theme song]
42200e Oh, my goodness!
42200d You said it. The Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange is simply divine. You can get anything you want here!
422008 If'n you got the goods to trade for it.
422005 [grunts] Wha? Nooo! Thanks, Twilight. Whew. One ding, nick or dent, and this Power Ponies comic book wouldn't be in perfect mint condition anymore. And if you want to trade for a mint comic, you gotta have a mint comic.
422000 [crowd murmuring]
422008 I guess a pony who's here on official princess business has to expect a little fussin'.
422003 But all I'm supposed to do is settle disagreements over whether a trade is fair or not. And since the rule is that a trade is fair as long as both ponies get what they want, there's never been a disagreement. So there's really no reason for anypony to treat me as anything special. Hi! Can I help you? [sighs]
42200c There's a pony here who's got a signed first edition of Daring Do and the Quest for the Sapphire Statue, and I'm gonna get it! I've been able to get first editions of all of the Daring Do books, except this one! Nopony's ever put together a whole set, and I'm gonna be the first! If it hasn't been traded yet... It's the only one in all of Equestria!
42200e Oh no! I'd really hate to see you disappointed. I did want to trade this bear call I've got for a bird whistle, but getting that book seems so important to you, so if you need me to help you first...
42200c Normally I'd say I don't need any help, but you're right. This is really important. I've gotta get that book!
422008 Well, I'm off to take a gander at some of the vintage stalls.
42200d Did you say vintage? Why, old and rare items are so in style right now! I'm hoping to get a vintage item as well. I just hope I brought enough to trade.
422008 I know what you mean, Rarity. Hey! Why don't we pool our trade stashes?
42200d Pool?
422008 That way, if one of us finds somethin' real valuable she can't live without...
42200d [gasps] She'll definitely be able to get it! Who could say no to exchanging a single object for such a huge assortment of items? Oh, yes! That is absolutely brilliant! I'm so glad I have a friend like you, Applejack.
422008 I feel the same way.
42200d Then let's go shopping!
422007 Um, shouldn't your princessness be headed to the royal box seats?
422003 I may be the princess on duty, but I don't think that means I have to sit up there all alone doing nothing. Ever since I became a princess, Celestia's been sending me more books to read than ever. The library's overflowing, so I figured while we're here, I might as well trade away some books I don't need anymore.
422007 Mm-hm!
42200c [gasps] There it is! The first edition of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue! It hasn't been traded yet! [to stallholder] Lucky for you, because I've brought my most valuable possession to trade for it - My lucky horseshoe!
422259 I don't want it.
42200c What?!
422259 It's just a rusty old horseshoe. That's not worth anything to me.
42200e But, but how is Rainbow Dash going to get the book she really wants?
422259 Well, she's not.
42200c [sighs]
422000 [thud]
422259 Unless... she can get me that.
422000 [Orthros growling and barking]
42200e Aww, an Orthros! How cute!
422259 The pony running the ancient beasts stall doesn't want anything I've got. But if you can get me the Orthros, I'll trade you the book for it.
42200c You got it! [to Fluttershy] I don't know how, but somehow, we're gonna get that Orthros.
42200d Oh, Applejack, I am so glad I found you.
422008 Me too! You're not gonna believe it!
422043 [simultaneously] I found a super valuable vintage item I just have to have, and all it's gonna cost is all our stuff! [beat] Uh-oh.
42200d So, where is this valuable vintage item you want to trade everything we have for?
422008 There!
42200d Where?
422008 Right there!
42200d But... that's a dented old pie tin.
422008 A dented vintage pie tin. The metal they used to fashion this one helps cook the pies up to five seconds faster! They don't make 'em like this anymore!
42200d I'm so glad you showed that to me, darling...
422000 [clatter]
42200d ...because once you see what I've found, you won't want to waste our trade goods on that. [giggles] Just look at this gorgeous vintage brooch. It's one of a kind!
422008 It looks exactly like the one you're already wearin'.
42200d Well, yes, they may look the same, but I know it's older, and that's what makes it so much more divine!
422008 But that doesn't make a lick of sense! Why, I'd wager if I switched them up, you wouldn't even know the difference!
42200d Oh, don't be silly, of course I would!
422000 [brooches clinking]
422008 So which is the vintage one?
42200d That one, of course.
422008 Hah, you're bluffin'!
42200d Am I? How can you tell?
422008 Well... because... [groans] I can't, 'cause the one you wanna waste our whole stash on is exactly the same as the one you already got! There's no way anypony would notice the difference!
42200d I'd say it's a lot more likely they'd notice that than some dented tin that cooked a pie a whole two seconds faster!
422008 It's five seconds faster!
42200d [growls]
422008 [growls]
422000 [Orthros growling]
42200c [gulps]
422000 [Orthros barking]
42200e Yes, such a good two-headed boy. Yes, you are!
422000 [various creature noises]
42225a Stop that! C'mon, don't you start now, too!
42200c Okay, I can see you're busy, so I'll give it to you straight. I need to trade this horseshoe for... that.
42225a Nope.
42200c Aww.
42225a Down, boy! Watch out for the lamp!
422000 [crash]
42225a Well, I could use another lamp.
42200c A whole stand filled with Discord-shaped lamps? Seriously?!
42200e They really do have everything at the Traders Exchange.
42200c Will you trade a lamp for my horseshoe so I can trade it for an Orthros and get my book?
42225b No. But I'd trade it for an antique chicken.
42200c Great! [beat] What's an antique chicken?
42225c Oh, I got all kinds of antique chicken statues. I got your blue hens, speckled grays, your-
42200c Okay, cool! So will you trade one for a horseshoe so I can trade it for a lamp and then trade it for an Orthros so I can get my book?
42225c Well, lemme think... Uh, no.
42212c Aww.
42225c But I'd gladly trade one of my chickens for a crystal chalice.
42200c [panting] Hold on a sec. [inhales] We need a crystal chalice to trade for a chicken to trade for a lamp to trade for an Orthros. So what are you willing to trade for it? I'm guessing it's gotta be some crazy thing way across the Exchange.
42225d Actually, I could use a slightly rusty old horseshoe.
42200c Yeah, like where am I gonna find– wait, I've got one of those! Now that we've got the chalice, this is gonna be a cinch!
42200e Do you really think so?
42200c All we gotta do is bring this thing to the chicken stand and we are–
422000 [crystal fracturing]
42212c [screaming]
422003 You want me to trade all my books for a broken pen? Alright, fine. You got yourself a–
422007 Stop! What are you doing?!
422003 I was trying to get rid of all the books I don't need anymore.
422007 For that? Do you reaaaaally want that?
422003 Well, not really, but I'm running out of library space, so–
422007 Ohmygosh, ohmygosh, ohmygosh! I can't believe that almost happened! But luckily, it didn't happen, thanks to me.
422003 What are you talking about?
422007 According to the rules of the Exchange, a trade is only fair if both ponies end up with something they want. You can't break the rules! Did anypony see you do it? I don't think anypony saw! [to "Chirpy Hooves"] But you're not gonna say anything, are you?! Haha, I'm just kidding! Or am I?! Sometimes I can't even tell! [laughs]
422003 Y'know, if you want to go check out the rest of the Exchange and trade whatever you brought...
422007 Nope, I just came to pony-watch! I'm not going anywhere. I won't let you make a mistake like that again! Hey, everypony, step right up! Do not walk! Gallop over here for your chance to trade for authentic, one-of-a-kind, official princess merchandise!
422003 [groans]
42200c Well, that took forever.
42200e I just hope it looks okay.
42225c This is perfect!
422000 [smashing crystal]
42212c [gasps]
42225c Perfect for the broken chalice mosaic I'm making! Alright, so what kind of antique chicken do you want? I got speckled, brown, gray... [continues under]
42200c Oh no! The pony we're supposed to trade the chicken statue to didn't tell us what kind he wanted! Okay, look. I'm fast. I'll fly over to the lamp stand and find out what kind of chicken he wants. Just don't let anypony trade for any chicken while I'm gone, okay?
42200e Um, well, okay! Um, I can do that, I think. [to Crusoe Palm] Um, well, maybe you shouldn't get one of those? You know... unless you really want to...
42200c [groans] Beat it! You go. I'll stay here.
42200d Well, since we can't both get what we want, I will be the better friend. You take our trade goods and get what you want.
422008 I'm an amazin' friend! So even though it's for somethin' that don't seem valuable at all, you take our stash.
42200d How dare you let me get what I want. What kind of friend do you think I am? You are going to get what you want!
422008 No, you are!
42200d No, you are!
42200c Hello! [tapping] We got the kind of chicken you asked for! Hello? Where's the pony running this joint? 'On break'?! [groans]
422007 These books made Twilight the princess she is. Before that, she was nothing – a big, fat zero!
422003 Hey!
422007 Then she read these books, and voila! Princess! So who wants to start the bidding?
422000 [crowd chattering excitedly; 'Me', etc.]
422003 Uh, just a moment, please! Pinkie, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this. Nopony should trade for my books just because I'm a princess. I'm not better than anypony else!
422007 [hushed] I know you're not better than everypony! Just leave this to me! [to crowd, normal] Did I mention that Princess Twilight got these books from Princess Celestia?
4221ac Whoa, wait, you don't mean–
422007 Oh, that's right! Double princess!
422000 [crowd chattering excitedly]
42200e There he is!
42200c Look, I know it's your break and all, but you've gotta open your stand so we can trade you for a lamp!
42225b [stomach rumbles] Sorry, girls. Been trading all day. My belly's tellin' me it's time to eat an oatburger.
42200c Oh come on, please?
42200e Pretty pretty please?
42225b Sorry, belly says 'no'.
42200c But the Exchange ends at sundown!
42225b No!
42200c I've got an idea. Next! Next! Next! Next! Next!
42212c [straining]
42200c We're home free!
422000 [thump]
42200c As long as this thing doesn't drown us in slobber.
42200e Oh, he's just an affectionate little two-headed fellow. Aren't you, little boy?
422008 No, I insist. You go fetch what you want, 'cause that's the kind of tried and true friend I am.
42200d Well! I am way too generous to let you out-friend me like that!
42200c We gotta hurry! [gasps] We're never gonna get to the Daring Do stand through this crowd in time!
42200e [blows bear call]
42200c Come on!
42200e My bear call!
42200c We gotta go!
42200e Of course. It's just a bear call. There's nothing I could have traded it for that's more valuable to me than you.
42200c [sighs] Okay, the Exchange is almost over, but we did it. We traded a crystal chalice for an antique chicken...
42200e And the chicken for a lamp...
42200c And the lamp for an Orthros, just like you asked.
422000 [Orthros barks]
42200c So there you go! Now where's my book?
422259 Yeah, you know, the thing is... I don't really want an Orthros anymore.
42200e But... what do we do now?
42200c [groans]
422000 [thump]
422000 [Orthros panting]
42200e Oh goodness, oh goodness!
42200c Argh! Ugh...
42200e Good boy!
42200c Hey! You said you wanted an Orthros!
422259 I've been watching that thing over at the ancient beast booth! It's crazy! I don't want one in my house!
422000 [Orthros growls]
42200e There, there, that's a good Orthros. You just have to know how to train them. With a little patient training and a big slobber mop, they can be a wonderful household pet.
422259 [laughing] All right, all right. I'll trade you.
42200c Yes!
422259 If she comes and stays with us in Manehattan until it's trained!
42200e Gosh, training an Orthros takes a long time. I'll probably be gone from Ponyville for... I don't even know how many moons! But... if that is what you really want...
422259 So we got a fair deal?
42200c Of course it's a deal! Yeah-eah, whoo! [squeals] I did it, I did it! Fluttershy, can you believe it? Oh no. what did I do?!
422007 Who's got something valuable enough to trade for Princess Twilight's princess books that she got from Princess Celestia? Did I say "princess"?
422199 Over here, over here!
422007 Oh, come on! These are the books the princess would sit up with all night, with nothing to read by but the light of her own horn! Ooh, now that looks fun– but not fun enough! These are the books that made Twilight the princess she is! So who's got what it takes to trade for them?
42225e Well, when you put it like that...
4220ec [various disappointed noises]
422007 Wait, stop, come back! Uh, these books aren't that great... [giggles nervously]
422003 Oh, yes, they are.
422007 But I thought you wanted to get rid of them!
422003 None of those ponies had anything valuable enough to trade for my books. Not because these books belong to a princess, but because they helped make me who I am. Just like you said. This was the one I was so absorbed in the day Spike decided he owed Applejack a life debt. And this one reminds me of the day I got it – which was the day I met you. I may not ever need to read these again, but that doesn't mean they don't have value. I realize that now, thanks to you, Pinkie.
422007 I told you I'd take care of everything!
42200c Twilight! I need you to say a trade wasn't fair! Fast!
422003 I've heard what you both have to say, and I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but my hooves are tied. You said it was a fair trade.
42200c Yeah, I said it, but I was wrong! I did want that book, a lot. I said I wanted it more than anything in all of Equestria. But there's no thing that's worth as much to me as a friend. I might have forgotten that for a little bit, but it's true. Which means there's no way this trade can be fair!
422259 Oh, come on, that's... the sweetest thing I've ever heard. Okay, the trade's off!
422000 [crowd cheering]
422003 And with that, I declare this trial, and this year's Rainbow Falls Traders Exchange, over! [bangs gavel]
422007 [in distance] Woo-hoo!
42200d I know it's not the pie tin you were after, but I hope you like it. It's the rustiest piece of junk I could get.
422008 Well, I took my half of our stash and got you this!
42200d Ohhh!
422008 And I know you're gonna love it, 'cause you already have a bunch of ones that look exactly the same sittin' in the drawer doin' nothin'. So that should settle it once and for all which of us is the better friend.
42200c Oh, come on! You both gave up what you wanted to get something for each other! That's the coolest thing a friend can do. Trust me, I know.
422007 Hey, where's your double-doggie?
42200c I traded it for something way better.
42200e [blows bird whistle]
42225f [twittering]
422003 Well, what do you know? My copy of Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue. It's just a beat up old paperback, not a one-of-a-kind first edition...
42200c [gasps] Even better, because I can read this one with all my friends!
422003 [giggles]
422000 [credits]
423007 Hear ye, hear ye! The Ponyville Foal and Filly Fair is almost ready to begin!
423000 [crowd chattering]
423007 Whee, ha-ha, whoa! [laughing]
423000 [ding]
42300d Just because the attendees are young doesn't mean they don't deserve my very best creative work. Why, this puppet theater is going to be the talk of the Foal and Filly Fair!
423005 How could it not be? You're the one making it...
42300d Oh! But I couldn't have done it without the help of one of my dearest and most supportive friends! You are my favorite dragon.
423005 Your favorite dragon? Aw, gee...
42300d The hours have been long, the work taxing beyond compare, but it will all be worth it when we hear those three little words!
423260 This is awful!
42300d Awful?!
423260 And completely unusable. Hmmm... Ugh! It doesn't travel! Oh, there's no room for my puppets! It appears I won't have a traveling puppet theater to use after all.
423005 I don't know what that guy was talking about. This thing is perfect!
423000 [theme song]
42300d This is terrible, simply terrible! [whines]
423005 So that puppeteer didn't like your exquisitely crafted best puppet theater in the history of puppet theaters puppet theater. [beat] You can just contribute something else to the Foal and Filly Fair.
42300d [sobbing] I suppose I could... Oh, forget it, Spike. I'd never have something finished in time! [crying] [nomming] I wanted to leave my creative mark on the fair, and I failed – [chewing] miserably! And that makes me miserable! [crying]
423005 Argh, there's gotta be something in here somewhere.
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 It's not "who", it's "what"! Like, what can help Rarity make something in time for the fair? She really, really, really wants to make a creative contribution. She said I'm her favorite dragon, so it's up to me to come through for her in her time of need. There's gotta be some kind of spell that'll do the trick.
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 Come on, help a dragon out!
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 Ugh! It's not for me! It's for Rarity! The one who made you that bow tie you like so much?
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 Okay, I get it.
423000 [gears cranking]
423005 You don't think we should use magic– What is that?
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 [blows fire]
4230c3 [hoots nervously]
423000 [bats chittering]
4230c3 [hoots nervously]
423005 What? If I wasn't supposed to have it, it wouldn't be so easy to get. And it's covered in spikes, like me.
4230c3 [hoots nervously]
423005 "Inspiration Manifestation - Instantly brings ideas to life."
4230c3 [hoots nervously]
423005 I'm likin' the looks of this one. Hmmm.
42300d [crying] [nomming]
423005 Rarity!
42300d Leave me be! Can't you see how distraught, disappointed, and downtrodden I still am?
423005 But I brought you something.
42300d Unless it's another carton of vanilla oat swirl or word that the festival has been cancelled, I don't think I'm interested.
423005 It's magic!
42300d Spike, precious scales, I already have magic.
423005 But not the kind that can help you create something in time for the fair. This can!
42300d I suppose it's worth a try. "From in the head to out in the world, every thought to action. Hold close this book and through its spell, you'll start a chain reaction, projecting forth whatever beauty you see. Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free."
423005 Did it work?
42300d Hm, there's only one way to find out.
423000 [magic zap]
42300d [gasps] Oh, my! I thought about making this a much more beautiful spell book, and I have!
423000 [magic zap]
42300d Dear, dear Spike! Here I was about to give up, but like a true friend, you've come through with flying colors! Come! We must find the puppeteer right away, so that I may provide him with the most fabulous theater he's ever imagined! Or, should I say, that I've ever imagined.
423260 Ah, Miss Rarity, come to see the show, I presume? You'll notice I had to make do in light of your recent failure to produce a functioning theater.
42300d Oh, but I think you'll find the new one I've created will be much more to your liking!
423260 [mumbling] Ah, well, it is gorgeous, but that was never the problem now, was it? Oh, well, this one does seem to travel. Plenty of room for my puppets... I say, Miss Rarity, I don't know how you managed to do so in such a short amount of time, but you seem to have redeemed yourself. How did you manage to do so in such a short time?
423005 As a matter of fact, she used a s–
42300d A good designer never reveals her tricks.
42300d Thank you again, Spike, for being such a dear friend and finding this book for me!
423005 My pleasure. Well, guess I can return it now that the fair's over.
42300d Oh, yes, of course. I've made my creative contribution as I'd hoped to do, and all is well! Uh, then again, perhaps I should keep it just a skotch longer... You don't mind, do you, Spike?
423005 Of course not! See you tomorrow! [to Owlowiscious] What? She'll keep it for a few more hours, no harm in that.
423000 [distant magic zaps]
423005 [whistling]
423000 [knocking]
423005 Rarity?
423000 [muffled magic zaps]
423005 Whoa!
42300d Spike, I'm so glad you're here!
423005 Whoa! Are... you okay?
42300d Oh, I've never been better! This book you've given me is amazing! Why, I, I, I, I've been up all night just creating and creating and creating and creating! I've completed my fall line for the next fifteen seasons!
423005 Wow!
42300d But then I started thinking, 'why stop there'? Oh, Spike, I've always thought this town of ours could use a few beautifying upgrades, and with this book, I can make that happen with such ease! You will support me in this endeavor by letting me keep the book just a little longer?
423005 Of course I will!
4230c3 [hoots nervously]
423005 [panting] What do you say we get a little breakfast before we get started?
42300d No time for breakfast! I want to get started right away!
423005 Technically, we do have time, because with that book held close, you can just make things– Rarity?
42300d Now, this is exactly what I'm talking about! Why, that cart hasn't an ounce of stylish flair!
423000 [magic zap]
423009 My eyes playin' tricks on me again?
423008 What in rhubarb pie just happened?
42300d Isn't it gorgeous?
423005 It's amazing! You should ask Applejack if she wants you to give all the Apple family carts a makeover!
42300d Oh, I don't really think I need to ask permission, darling. Everyone loves surprises, especially when they're gorgeous ones!
423005 You're right! Everypony does love surprises.
42300d [hushed] We shouldn't even tell anypony that it's me who's behind all the fabulous changes I'll be making! [giggles] Won't that be a fun little secret for the three of us to share?
423005 The... three of us?
42300d You, me, and the book, of course. My marvelous, marvelous book!
423005 ...Of course.
42300d Promise me you won't say a word to anypony?
423005 [muffled] You got it!
42300d I knew I could count on you, Spike. And I also know just what I want to do next!
42300c [sounds of exertion] Take that! And that! [grunting] [laughs]
423000 [magic zap]
42300c What in the... Get... it... off... me! [grunts]
42300d I've always thought Rainbow Dash could use a little more glamor, and now look at her! Cloud-busting with style! [short laugh] Moving on!
423005 She'll be fine. It's just a dress. Uh, wait for your favorite dragon!
423000 [crash]
42300c [exhales]
423000 [birdseed pouring]
42300e La la-la la-la la-la la la... There you go, Mr Robin!
423261 [chirping]
42300e Don't you look so content in your little house–
423000 [magic zap]
42300e [gasps] Oh, my goodness!
423261 [distressed chirping]
42300e You're lost? No, not that way, that looks like it's the door to a... bedroom. Try that one over there. No, no, that leads to a...
423000 [door slams]
42300e Shoe closet? Oh, dear. Maybe try the staircase? Oh, no-no-no, the other staircase.
42300d Isn't it gorgeous?
423005 It's probably the most beautiful birdhouse ever created.
42300d Go on.
423005 I'm just not sure how the bird feels about it.
42300d Pfft, what does a bird know about architectural design? What matters is what you think, Spike. And you love it. Don't you?
423005 Of course I do. It's so... [beat] Rarity.
42300d It is, isn't it? Ooh!
423000 [thunk]
423000 [foals laughing]
42300d Oh, adorable! But it could use a touch of class, don't you think?
423005 Oh yeah, definitely.
423000 [magic zaps]
42300d This party doesn't even seem to have a proper theme. Let's do something about that, shall we?
423005 You've already made things look really really great. Maybe you should stop while you're ahead?
42300d You're right, Spike! There's so much to do elsewhere!
423005 Right! Elsewhere...
42300d Just one more little thing before we go...
423000 [abrupt music change]
42300d Why, this party is certain to make the society page now. Won't Pinkie Pie be pleased?
423007 Happy, happy day to– huh?!
42300d I am simply buzzing with ideas. Simply buzzing!
423005 That's great! But, uh, you've been at this for a while now. How 'bout you take a break? Give that brilliant mind of yours a rest?
42300d Don't be silly! I'm not going to stop now! Why, I won't stop until every inch of Ponyville has benefited from my creative vision! Starting with you, Spike!
423000 [magic zap]
42300d You look fabulous!
423005 All because of you, heh...
42300d Anything for my favorite dragon and most supportive friend. Come, there's so much more to do!
423003 [gasps] Oh no, not you too!
423005 What do you mean, not me too?
423003 Oh. Judging by that outfit, I thought for sure you'd–
423005 What? This? I just wanted to try out a new look.
423000 [thud]
423005 You like?
423003 Hmm... Well, in that case, have you seen anypony suspicious around?
423005 Uh, nope.
423010 Princess Twilight, the gazebo has been turned into solid crystal, and two ponies are now trapped inside its walls!
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 No! I made a promise to Rarity to keep this to myself!
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 [sighs] But you're right, Owlowiscious. I have to tell. And once I do, I can forget Rarity thinking of me as her most supportive friend... I can forget Rarity thinking of me as a friend at all...
423005 [sighs] I can't do it. I promised I'd keep all of this between the three of us!
4230c3 [hoots]
423005 Of course it's weird she meant her, me and the spell book. But– The spellbook! Of course! If I can get it away from her, I bet she won't be able to use its magic anymore! Oh, come on, it's the perfect plan! I... just have to figure out which way she went.
423262 I can't see!
423000 [ponies complaining]
423005 I'm thinking she's headed this way.
42300d [giggling] What do you think you're doing?!
423005 Uh, me? I was just, uh... basking in your creative radiance.
42300d Oh, Spike, you do say the nicest things.
423005 Thanks.
42300d Now, where was I? Oh yes! Gold-plated rooftops for everypony!
4230c3 [hooting]
42300d Spike!
423005 [chomp]
42300d I have just had the most marvelous idea!
423005 [gulps] [gasps] Of course you have. You're Rarity.
42300d My work here in Ponyville is nearly complete. Don't you think it's time the rest of Equestria benefited from my creative vision?
423005 Absolutely!
42300d Ooh, I'm thinking we go by chariot! Or, as everyone will soon be calling them, "Rariot"! [laughs]
423005 Oh, yeah, we should definitely go by–
423000 [magic zap]
423005 Huh?! How... how did you... do that?
42300d Why, whatever do you mean?
423005 The book! It's– I mean– you don't– it's gone! The book is gone!
42300d Gone? Why, it's right there. [gasps] I need my book, Spike! What have you done with my book?! [growls]
423005 Why would I do anything with your book? We're friends! It... it was probably the owl!
4230c3 [hoots]
42300d But, wait... I don't seem to need it anymore, do I? Yes... yes...! I can feel its magic flowing within me now! I'm so excited! I'm so excited!
423005 [quietly] I'm so scared.
42300d Oh, the places we'll go, Spike! Manehattan, Fillydelphia, Canterlot! And there you'll be by my side, just as you've always been here in Ponyville, your constant praise and adoration driving me to even greater heights, until there isn't an inch of Equestria that hasn't been utterly transformed by my creative genius!
423005 ...No.
42300d What did you say?
423005 I said 'no'. You've been changing things, but you haven't been making them better. I should have told you the truth at the very beginning, but I didn't because I was trying to be a supportive friend. [sighs] But instead, I let you become something awful.
42300d Awful?
423000 [magic whirling]
42300d Ugh... what happened?
423005 Rarity! You're okay?
42300d I... I think so... though by the looks of it, something quite terrifying has happened to Ponyville.
423005 You happened.
42300d Me?
423005 The last part of the spell!
42300d [flashback] Only when true words are spoken will you finally be set free.
423005 The spell took over you, and you wanted to change everything in Equestria. I was afraid to tell you how I really felt about it, but then I... I told you the truth.
42300d Dearest Spike, you should never be afraid to tell me the truth. We're friends, remember?
423005 Today I learned how important it is to be honest with your friends when they're doing something that you don't think is right. A true friend knows that you're speaking up because you care about them.
423000 [door opens]
423003 Spike. Never, ever, ever, ever take another book out of the library at the castle without asking! Princess Cadance and Princess Luna have much better things to do than help me clean up Ponyville! Do you have any idea how hard it was to reverse that much dark magic?!
423005 [chuckles] You don't look so good.
423003 [growls]
423005 What? I'm just being honest! It's what good friends do!
423003 [growls]
423000 [credits]
42400c This just got real!
424000 [ponies chattering]
424081 [cheering]
424000 [creaking]
42400c Listen up, gang! We're almost there, so I've got a few things to say. First off, who here besides me thinks this is the best Equestria Games delegation in Ponyville history?
424000 [ponies cheering]
42417b Yeah!
42400c And no matter what your sport is, we gotta give it our best, because we've all got a genuine shot at Ponyville gold!
424000 [ponies cheering]
42400c ...With the possible exception of Bulk Biceps, Fluttershy, and me. I mean, we're good and all, but we're up against the Wonderbolts in the aerial relay, so gold's kind of a stretch. Let's not kid ourselves.
424065 Don't feel bad, Rainbow Dash! We have absolutely no shot at getting gold either!
42400c Uh, that's because you're carrying the flag for Ponyville in the opening ceremony. There are no winners.
424065 Winners or not, we still have the chance to be awesome!
42400c That's the spirit! You hear that, everypony? Winners or not, we all still have the chance to be awesome!
424000 [ponies cheering]
42400c But, uh, let's still try to win lots and lots of stuff too, 'kay?
424000 [theme song]
424000 [steam hissing]
424000 [bell ringing]
424005 [straining] It's all in there, gang! Leave it to Spike, champion gear-carrier for all your gear-carrying needs.
42400a And the Ponyville flag? You sure? And what about the flagpole?
424005 In with the portable ramp! Whoa!
424000 [thud]
424065 Give it a rest, Apple Bloom.
424005 Aw, she's just nervous, that's all. Perfectly understandable. Whenever I'm afraid I'll forget something or start to panic, I have a simple trick. I count to ten, and by the time I'm done, I've calmed myself enough to get the job done right every time. Easy-peasy, cider-squeezy!
424000 [hooves rumbling]
424005 Hey! Put me down!
424065 What's going on?!
424003 Spike! Are you all right?
424263 A thousand pardons, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious.
424005 Huh? Who the what now?
424198 [to guards] Thanks for bringing Spike to us. [to Spike] It's okay, Spike. We'll have our hoofponies go back for your bags.
424005 Uh, can they hang back a second and tell me what's going on first?
424005 [eating] Mm! So the ponies here think I'm some kind of hero, huh? [to Fleur De Verre] More of the green ones, please? I like the green ones.
424003 Last time you were here, you got the Crystal Heart to Princess Cadance in time to save this entire empire from destruction!
424198 You are known throughout my empire as "Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious".
424003 Isn't that awesome? You're a big shot here, Spike! See that? That's you!
424005 [a la Barbra Streisand] Hello, gawgeous!
424198 This is why we all hope you do us the honor of lighting the torch at the opening ceremony. You'd be the very first dragon in the history of the Equestria Games to do so.
424005 Of course I'll do it! And – bonus – I can do it with my fire breath! [breathes fire] [laughs nervously]
424000 [crowd cheering]
424193 Places for the procession, everypony! Two minutes!
424007 [laughing]
4241f7 And you're quite certain you also understand exactly what you're supposed to do?
424005 I stand where you tell me until you give me the signal, and then I walk over and light the torch.
4241f7 Mm. Couldn't be simpler.
424000 [crowd cheering]
424005 [gasps]
4241f7 Mr the Dragon, are you coming? [to herself] Honestly. [out loud] Would somepony help him walk?
424193 Now, please welcome the delegation from Ponyville!
424081 Ponyville forever! Yay!
42400c Awesome!
42400e Yay.
42417b Yeah!
424041 [cheering]
424003 [cheering]
4241f7 [stomps hoof] This is the signal! [stomps hoof] I'm giving you the signal now! Mr the Dragon!
424005 [inhales] [coughing] Come on, Spike! Calm yourself! Count to ten. One... two... three... thousand... fourteen thousand... Twenty thousand...! Thirty thousand...!
424198 What's wrong?
424005 [inhales] [weak breath] Tell me this isn't happening...
424003 Equestria, we have a problem.
424005 [inhales] [coughing]
4241f7 Mr the Dragon! Would you light the torch already?!
424005 I don't know what it is, but I just don't have the stuff today! Did you bring a match?
4241f7 You're a fire-breathing dragon.
424005 [coughs] [raspy] Then some cough drops, maybe?
4241f7 [growls]
424005 Nevermind. I'll keep trying. [exhales]
424198 Somepony go down and help him!
424005 [clicking] Light! Light! [straining]
424000 [flames whooshing]
424000 [crowd cheering]
424003 Phew!
4241f7 Oh! How did you do that?
424005 I'm... not sure.
4241f7 Oh, well. Better late than never.
424193 Let the games begin!
424000 [crowd cheering]
42400d Oh! There are our little superstars! You were fabulous!
424008 Made me sit up proud like a cornstalk in August!
42400c Ya done good, squirt!
424003 You three really were wonderful. But does anypony know what was going on with Spike?
424008 He sure seemed to be having a tough time of it out there.
42400d He put things right in time, though.
424003 Actually, it was me. I didn't want him to be embarrassed, so I cast a secret spell to light it for him.
42400d Oh, dear. Have you told him?
424003 No, but he might have figured it out on his own.
424008 You gotta tell him, just in case.
424003 I know. I'm just afraid of how he'll take it. I know what pride he takes in a job well done.
42400c Psst, here he comes now! Act casual! [to Spike] 'Sup?
424003 Spike! Is everything okay?
424005 I guess. I don't know. The weirdest thing happened down there.
424003 Yeah, about that. I–
424005 I mean, there I was, trying to light the torch, with all of Equestria watching, and feeling like the hugest failure ever, and then the thing just lit! It was amazing!
424003 Oh, phew! I was afraid you'd be upset.
424005 Upset? Are you kidding? Why would I be upset to discover I can light fire... with my mind?
424264 What?!
4241b5 Look, look, it's the Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious!
4241ad Can we get your autograph?
424005 Sure!
424000 [scribbling]
4241b5 How you saved our Empire last time you were here was really amazing!
424005 Aw. You know what else is amazing? Watch this! [beat] [straining] Don't worry. Once it bursts into flames through brainpower, I'll sign another one for ya. Promise. [straining]
424003 [whispering] Spike, may I have a word with you a moment?
424005 Hey, you'd better be careful with that! It might burst into flames later! Delayed reaction. Hey, Twi, what is it? Hold on, hold on, give me a second... If I can set fire to stuff with my mind, mind-reading must be just around the corner! And I predict that you are about to ask me... to set fire to something with my mind!
424003 No, because you can't!
424005 Oh, really? So how do you explain what happened down there in front of thousands and thousands of–
424003 I did it, Spike. I cast a spell to do it for you.
424005 In front of... thousands and... thousands...?
424003 I'm sorry, Spike. I just couldn't stand to see you stuck like that! You understand, don't you?
424005 I... I... I need to be alone right now.
424003 Spike?
424265 O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious, can I get your autograph?
424005 Sorry. You should probably ask somebody special instead.
424000 [crowd cheering]
424193 Our next event... [amplified, some distance away] ...the aerial relay!
424008 That's Dash and Fluttershy!
424007 Oh, no! We can't be late for that!
424266 Miss? Step right over here. Unicorns will no longer be admitted without a disabling spell, to prevent cheating. And make sure you don't even try casting a spell, or we'll know it.
42400d Hmph!
424007 [chewing] [swallows] If Ponyville medals here, we'll have eight medals so far, putting us tied for the lead with Cloudsdale! Unless Cloudsdale medals here too...!
424005 Ms. Harshwhinny? I know you're really busy, but...
4241f7 What is it?
424005 Maybe there's something else I can do for the Games. Y'know, something really worthy of the Crystal Empire's admiration?
4241f7 What are you talking about? You lit the torch for the whole thing!
424005 Uh, well, actually, that wasn't really–
4241f7 That wasn't worthy enough for you? Ugh, for pony's sake! Next thing you know, you'll be asking to put on a rock concert. [snorts] [to herself] Celebrities...
424005 Wait, that's it!
424000 [crowd cheering]
42400d Second place!
424008 We got silver!
424193 Congratulations to all our medalists. And now, the anthem of–
424005 And I shall do the honor of singing!
424000 [crowd cheers]
424193 [to Spike, hushed] Spike, what are you doing?!
424005 You know how they always just play the music? [amplified] Well, I know all the words to our anthem, and will sing them for you now, loud and proud, to the enjoyment of all!
424000 [crowd cheers]
424193 And now... um... the Cloudsdale anthem, as sung by... Spike!
424005 Wait! The Cloudsdale anthem?
424193 [hushed] They only play the anthem for the winner, Spike! The Wonderbolts are from Cloudsdale!
424005 But... But I don't know the words to the Cloudsdale anthem! I've never even heard it!
424267 Sing for us, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious!
424005 [clears throat] [singing out of time and rhythm]
424005 Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast
424005 And we're from Cloudsdale which-is-a-part-of-Equestria  [laughs nervously]
424005 That we like best and we're proud and we're fast and we like it because it really has nice trees
424005 Yeah, we love the town because it's so cool and, and we like to fly really fast and everything like that
424000 [sighs] I kinda wish this was over 'cause it is... n't... yet... over... now.
424000 Oh, we're the Wonderbolts and we're super fast and we're cloud– from Cloudsdale
424000 We like it there 'cause it's really nice and the trees are cool and I hope it is over now
424000 And... it keeps going on, la la la
424000 And we really love the town
424000 So I wish that this... song... was over now.
424000 Over... now.
424000 Over... now.
424000 [silence from crowd]
424000 [baby crying]
424007 Nailed it!
42400a Spike, you comin'?
424005 Nah, I got this stuff to pack up.
424065 But you've been moping in here for almost the entire Games.
424066 And tonight's the closing ceremony!
424005 Which means we leave tomorrow. Ergo, the packing.
424000 [crowd cheering]
424193 And so the Games conclude as they always do, with the ice archery finals! Ice archers, take your places!
424000 [crowd cheering]
424008 Too bad Ponyville doesn't have any ice archers competin'. We don't have anyone to root for.
424007 That's okay. Ponyville has thirty seven medals, and Cloudsdale thirty six, so looks like we'll be medal champs of the Games anyway! Woo-hoo!
42400c But Cloudsdale has two ice archery finalists down there now! If they both place, Cloudsale wins the medal count!
424007 So you're saying that it all comes down to this one event?!
424008 Pretty much.
424007 Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh! Twilight! Come take this extra seat next to me and freak out over the medal count! I'll show you how - Omigoshomigoshomigoshomigosh!
424003 Actually, I was looking for Spike. Have you seen him?
42400a He wouldn't come.
424066 We tried to talk him into it...
424065 ...but he wouldn't listen!
424007 You can have his extra seat, though. Uh... Twi?
424005 [exhales]
424003 Spike?
424005 [gasps]
424003 You here?
424005 [chokes] Uh, yeah! I'm super-busy! Look at all this packing left to do, heh. Crazy, right?
424003 No more hiding out. You're coming with me. Now.
424005 Okay, fine. I'll come. Can I at least wear these?
424000 [arrows being fired]
42400c Those aren't your average arrows. They freeze whatever part of the target they hit. Whoever encases their entire target in ice first wins. Keep your eye on number seven from Cloudsdale – he's the favorite.
424003 Honestly, Spike, I don't see why you're being so hard on yourself.
424005 I let everypony down. Twice. You never let anypony down, so you don't have any idea what that's like.
424003 Are you kidding? I've totally let ponies down. That's not the point. The torch got lit, the aerial relay teams got their medals – no harm, no foul.
424005 Can we at least watch from inside there? I'm not sure I'm ready to face crowds in the stands just yet.
424000 [arrows being fired]
424000 [ice crackling]
424000 [crowd gasping, screaming]
424193 No!
424268 [gasps]
42400c Steer it towards the field, away from the crowds!
424193 Somepony cut the disabling spell!
424269 There isn't time!
424005 Dash, Fluttershy! Move!
424000 [fire whooshing]
424000 [steam hissing]
424000 [rain pouring]
424000 [crowd cheering]
42400c That was awesome!
42411a [various exclamations of praise]
424198 I just wanted to thank you personally for saving those ponies and the Games, O Great and Honorable Spike the Brave and Glorious. You must be very proud.
424005 I guess.
42426a You guess?!
424005 I just saw what needed to be done and reacted. Just so happens I can breathe fire and... if any of you could do that, you'd have done the same.
424008 Forgive me for bein' blunt, Spike, but you're not makin' a lick of sense.
424005 Well, it's just how I feel.
424003 Wait a second. I think I get it. You keep saying you let everypony down, but we all keep saying you didn't. You know who's disappointed in you, Spike? You. And only you can make it right with you again. What would that take, Spike?
424005 Meh, I don't know. Can you turn back time? 'Cause I'd sure like a do-over on that opening ceremony.
424198 We can't turn back time, but, would you do me the great honor of lighting fireworks in my place at the closing ceremonies tonight?
424003 Come on, Spike. You saved the Crystal Empire twice! I think you can light some fireworks.
424005 Mm, I guess I have to at least give it a shot.
424012 [cheering]
424000 [crowd cheering]
424007 We did it! Ponyville won the medal count, and only by one medal!
42400c Hmm, wonder which medal that was? Bam!
424008 How does it feel to have opened the best Equestria Games in Ponyville history, squirt?
42400a Probably as good as it feels to close them!
424000 [guards marching]
4241f7 Okay, it's time!
424005 You know, it's kinda weird. No matter how many times others tell you you're great, all the praise in the world means nothing if you don't feel it inside. [inhales] [breathes fire] Sometimes to feel good about yourself, you gotta let go of the past. That way, when the time comes to let your greatness fly, you'll be able to light up the whole sky.
424000 [fireworks exploding]
424000 [credits]
425000 [train whistle]
425005 Seems like only yesterday I was saving this place from being totally destroyed. Hey, you guys remember that?
42500c You only mentioned it about fifteen times on the train here.
42500d [sarcastically, to Rainbow Dash] Yes, and we never hear a peep out of you about your exploits.
42500c Heh, point taken.
425003 I'm glad you all wanted to come, but I don't think it's gonna be that exciting. I pretty much just have to smile and wave as the dignitaries arrive.
42500d Yes, but you get to smile and wave like a princess.
425008 How exactly is that different than smilin' and wavin' like not a princess?
425003 It isn't.
42500e What's wrong, Twilight?
425007 Why the looooooooong face?
425003 I've just been feeling a little unsure about things lately. It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
425008 That's just silly. You've got a real important role in Equestria.
42500e Princess Celestia wouldn't have asked you to come today if she didn't think so.
425003 I guess you're right.
42500d Of course we are. Now hurry along! You don't want to risk having that important role diminished because you were tardy for your regal meet-and-greet.
425000 [fanfare]
42526b The Duke and Duchess of Maretonia!
425005 That was it? Princess Celestia had you come all the way to the Crystal Empire just to do that? I mean, whoa, really regal and important! [laughs nervously]
425000 [thwack]
425000 [theme song]
425000 [doors open]
42526c Your highness. Thank you for understanding our desire to keep the number of those privy to these confidential discussions to a minimum.
425003 Of course.
425000 [doors open and close]
425003 Is there anything else I can do to assist with their visit?
425198 I'm sorry, Twilight, but their visit is already over.
425003 Oh.
42501a Something wrong?
425003 I guess I just don't really understand why I'm here. Couldn't one of the royal guard have unfurled the banner?
425019 Having all four of us in the Empire to greet them lets the dignitaries know that their visit is considered an important one.
425198 Plus, it gives me an opportunity to see my favorite sister-in-law.
425003 And I'm happy to see you. All of you.
425198 But...?
425003 But I... well, it's just that Princess Luna raises the moon, Princess Celestia raises the sun, you protect the Crystal Empire, and all I seem to do is... smile and wave.
425003 [Twilight Sparkle]
425003 It isn't that I'm ungrateful
425003 For all the things that I've earned,
425003 For all the journeys I have taken,
425003 All the lessons that I have learned
425003 But I wonder where I'm going now,
425003 What my role is meant to be
425003 I don't know how to travel
425003 To a future that I can't see
425003 I have my wings, I wear this crown
425003 I'm a princess, this is true
425003 But it's still unclear to me
425003 Just what I am meant to do
425003 I wanna have a purpose
425003 Wanna do all that I can
425003 I wanna make a contribution
425003 I want to be a part of the plan
425019 [Princess Celestia]
425019 Your destiny's uncertain
425019 And that's sometimes hard to take
425019 But it will become much clearer
425019 With every new choice you make
42501a [Princess Luna]
42501a Patience is never easy
42501a I understand wanting more
42501a I know how hard it is to wait
42501a To spread out your wings and soar
425198 [Princess Cadance]
425198 But you stand here for a reason
425198 You're gifted and you are strong
425198 That crown is upon your head because
425198 You belong
425000 [Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance]
425000 Know that your time is coming soon
425000 As the sun rises, so does the moon
425000 As love finds a place in every heart
425000 You are a princess; you'll play your part
42501a [Princess Luna]
42501a We understand you wanting more
42501a A chance to shine, a chance to soar
425198 [Princess Cadance]
425198 Soon will come the day it turns around
425000 [Princesses Celestia, Luna, and Cadance]
425000 Know that your time is coming soon
425000 As the sun rises, so does the moon
425000 As love finds a place in every heart
425000 You are a princess; you'll play your part
425019 [Princess Celestia]
425019 You are a princess; you'll play your part
425019 Your time will come.
425000 [can clanking]
42526d [heavy breathing]
42526e Very sorry. [chuckles] You came out of nowhere.
42526d "Is he friend or is he foe?" the pony wonders. I can assure you... I am no friend. I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago. [laughing]
425019 [gasps]
42501a Sister, are you alright?!
425019 I've just had the most terrible dream.
42501a Why do you think I'm here? You know as well as I that this was not a dream, but a vision.
425019 Then we haven't much time. The stronger he becomes, the more we are all in danger.
425000 [pages turning]
425019 [narrating] Tirek and his brother Scorpan came here from a distant land, intent on stealing Equestrian magic. But Scorpan soon came to appreciate the ways of Equestria, even befriending a young unicorn wizard.
42501a [narrating] Scorpan urged his brother to abandon their plans. When Tirek refused, Scorpan alerted us to Tirek's intentions.
425019 [narrating] Scorpan returned to his own land, and Tirek was sent to Tartarus for his crimes. But it appears he has found a way to escape.
42501a We believe it happened when Cerberus left his post at the gates.
425003 But that was a long time ago. Why is he just now starting to steal magic?
425019 His time in Tartarus left him very weak. He has just now gained enough strength to use his dark powers.
42501a But with each passing moment, he grows stronger still.
425198 And I know just the princess who can stop him.
425003 Yes. I'll find him and–
425019 No, Twilight. I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek. Discord.
42526f [gasps]
425008 ...As in Discord Discord?
425003 Yes!
42500e I don't think it's that big of a surprise. He can be very helpful.
425000 [beat]
425003 He can sense when there's a magical imbalance. The next time Tirek steals magic, Discord will be able to track him down!
42500c So what are you supposed to do in the meantime?
425003 [sighs] Nothing. Unless of course one of you needs me to smile and wave.
425005 Where are you going?
425003 To the Castle of the Two Sisters. I'm not really needed anywhere else. Might as well catch up on some of my reading.
42500c You want some company?
425008 It has been a while since we visited the castle. Might be fun!
425003 Maybe I could use a little company right now.
42500c [sighs] I still can't believe we had to give back the Elements.
42500d It had to be done or the Tree of Harmony wouldn't have survived.
42500e But Twilight was right. Even without the Elements, our friendship is as strong as ever.
425008 I just hope another 'friend' of ours never makes us sorry we had to give them up.
4250db [laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?
425008 How'd you guess?
4250db My ears were burning.
425000 [splash]
42500c What are you even doing here, Discord?
4250db Oh, just a bit of light reading before I head off on my extremely important mission. I suppose you all know that I've been tasked to capture a certain escapee.
425005 Big deal.
4250db You're right, Spike. It is a big deal. Seems I possess a magic that gives me quite an important role in Equestria. Maybe they should make me an Alicorn princess.
425000 [cheering offscreen]
4250db Mmwah! Mmwah!
42500c In your dreams!
425000 [bonk]
4250db Oh, I never dream of such things. Ask Princess Luna.
425008 Don't you have a creepy magic-stealin' villain to track down?
4250db Yes, yes, yes, of course. It's just that I couldn't help but notice that Twilight hasn't yet opened this little chest of hers. I-I-It got me thinking, what if what's locked inside is something that could help her prove her royal worth? I only bring it up because she said that she's been feeling like her role as a princess doesn't equate to much.
425007 Wait a minute! How do you know how she was feeling?!
4250db [mock sadness] Oh, my. Is eavesdropping not the way you're supposed to find out what your best pals are up to? Woe is me. Will I ever learn the intricate nuances of being a good friend?
425000 [beat]
4250db [clears throat] Well in any case, I suppose now is as good a time as any for me to make my exit.
425000 [engine starts]
425008 And good riddance!
4250db Oopsie-doopsie, I almost left with the little journal you've all been keeping. What a fascinating read. Haven't you girls just learned so much? I've bookmarked a few of the more interesting passages. You really should take a look! [to Fluttershy, hushed] We're still on for tea later, aren't we, Fluttershy?
42500e I wouldn't miss it.
4250db [singsong] Well, I'll bring the cucumber sandwiches...!
425000 [door shuts]
425008 Sometimes I think the 'reformed' Discord is more obnoxious than the 'before-he-was-reformed' Discord.
42500d Indeed.
42500e But he could be right, couldn't he? What if there is something important in that chest?
425003 There's only one way to find out.
425000 [pages turning]
425003 Anything?
425025 [various 'no's]
425003 There must be something in this library that can help me figure out how to open it. The answer's in one of these books. I just know it.
425000 [pages turning]
425000 [thump]
4250db Tirek, I presume?
42526d Discord. You're free?
4250db As a bird.
42526d I commend you on your escape.
4250db I'm afraid the feeling isn't mutual. [snaps fingers]
425000 [chain clinking]
42526d Oh, I should have known you would want to have Equestria all to yourself.
4250db Oh, I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing it for my friends. [hushed] Just between the two of us, it's mostly for Fluttershy. [squee]
42526d Fluttershy? You're not saying you're friends with ponies?
4250db Surprise!
42526d I am surprised that someone with your intellect does not see this 'friendship' is but a new form of imprisonment. Clearly you've had to abandon your true nature to stay in their good graces.
425000 [harp playing]
4250db I have done nothing of the sort!
42526d Oh, please, I've seen this before. But he was always weak minded. You are Discord, you are legend, you cannot fall into the same trap that claimed my brother! Help me to grow strong, and be rewarded with something far greater than friendship. Freedom. Once I've stripped these ponies of their magic, nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see their world turned upside down. Who better to do so than the master of chaos himself? Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness. Unless, of course, 'pony errand boy' is the role you've always wanted to play in this world.
425003 I think I found something! I've been reading our journal, and there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked. Applejack, do you remember when you had to tell everypony that the tonic Granny bought from the Flim Flam brothers didn't really work?
425008 How could I forget? It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do.
425009 [gulping]
425008 [flashback] I hate to disappoint everypony, but there's no way Granny could have made that dive, because this tonic is a fake!
425000 [crowd gasps]
425008 [present] And in that moment, I knew I had to be honest. I just knew it. But what's that got to do with openin' the chest?
425003 I've found that each of you has had to face a situation where living up to the Element of Harmony you represent wasn't easy. Fluttershy, it was when you realized that the way to show kindness to the Breezies was by forcing them to leave your home.
42500e Oh, the looks on their poor little faces! But I knew that, as difficult as it was, pushing them away was the kindest thing I could do.
425003 Rarity, even after Suri took advantage of your generosity at Fashion Week in Manehattan, you didn't let it cause you to abandon your generous spirit.
42500d I simply couldn't have lived with myself if I didn't do something special for the friends who have always been so generous to me!
425003 Rainbow Dash, you had the chance to fly with the Wonderbolts at the Equestria Games, but instead you chose to compete with your friends.
42500c Sure! But being loyal to my friends was way–
425007 Ooh, my turn, my turn!
425003 Pinkie Pie, you realized that seeing your friend laugh was more important than proving you were a better party planner than Cheese Sandwich.
42500c Best party I've ever had.
42500d It's clear we've all had our moments to shine, Twilight, but I'm with Applejack. What does any of this have to do with the opening of the chest?
425003 All of you had tough choices to make. But when you made the right one and embraced your element, it helped somepony else make the right choice too. Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change. I know it sounds crazy, but maybe there's something special about those objects that could lead us to the location of the keys. The chest is connected to the Tree of Harmony, the Tree is connected to the Elements, and the Elements are connected to all of us. There must be a connection! I hate to admit it, but maybe Discord was trying to be a good friend after all.
425003 I don't see anything on them that would give us a clue as to where the keys might be. They're just... ordinary, everyday objects.
425007 Come on, Boneless! Give us that key!
425000 [Boneless squeaking]
425003 I don't think that's going to work.
425000 [Boneless squeaking]
425012 [gasps]
425000 [magic zaps]
425000 [keys clicking]
425003 There's still one key missing. The key that represents the element of magic. My element.
42500e Oh, but I'm sure that if we've gotten our keys, you have too, Twilight.
42500d Think, Twilight. When have you completed a difficult magical task, and in doing so encouraged another pony to do the same?
425003 I haven't. If I had, I would have written about it in the journal.
425005 Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure you'll get your key eventually. [sharp inhalation] [hurk]
425000 [magic pop]
425005 What's it say?
425003 That I'm needed in Canterlot at once!
425000 [door opens]
425003 I came as quickly as I could! Is something wrong? Is it Tirek?
425019 I'm afraid I put too much trust in Discord and the effect that friendship would have upon him.
425000 [crowd gasps]
42501a Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.
425000 [crowd gasps]
425000 [magic noises]
425000 [Discord clapping]
425003 How could he do this?! I thought our friendship meant something to him! I thought he had changed.
425019 Tirek has stolen enough magic that he now has the strength to steal flight as well. Without Pegasi to control the weather, there will be no rain in Equestria. There is word he has gone after Earth ponies as well. Without their strength, they will not be able to tend the land.
42501a Ponies will no longer be in control of their world. That power will belong solely to Tirek.
425019 There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic. With Discord by his side, we will not be able to stop him from taking it.
42501a Once it is in his possession, his power will know no bounds, and all hope will be lost.
425019 But there is one solution. It is only by making this sacrifice that Equestria and the lands beyond it might be saved. We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
425003 [gasps]
425000 [To be continued...]
425000 [credits]
426000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
42600e What's wrong, Twilight?
426003 It doesn't seem that my new role as a princess equates to all that much.
42626d I am Lord Tirek, and I will take what should have been mine long ago.
42601a With each passing moment, he grows stronger still.
426198 And I know just the princess who can stop him.
426019 I'm afraid I must call in another to stop Tirek.
4260db [laughs] Oh, you're talking about me, I presume?
4260db Haven't you girls just learned so much?
426003 And there's something interesting about the sections that Discord bookmarked.
426003 Each of you received something from the pony whose life you helped change.
426003 There's still one key missing. My element.
42626d Join me, Discord, and reclaim your greatness.
42601a Discord has betrayed the ponies of Equestria and joined forces with Tirek.
426019 There is no doubt that Tirek is after Alicorn magic.
426019 We must rid ourselves of our magic before Tirek has the chance to steal it from us.
426003 [gasps]
426000 [theme song]
42601a Tirek is set on possessing Alicorn magic. When he comes for us, we cannot have what he is looking for.
426003 I'm more than willing to do my part and give up my magic.
42601a You misunderstand. Our magic cannot just disappear into thin air. Somepony must keep it safe.
426198 That somepony is you, Twilight.
426003 Why me?
426019 We do not believe that Tirek is aware that a fourth Alicorn princess exists in Equestria. If we transfer our magic to you, Tirek will not know where it has gone.
426198 Do you understand what we're asking of you?
426003 Yes. It's just... I'm only now learning how to control my own Alicorn magic. To take on even more–
426198 Twilight, you represent the element of magic. If there is anypony who can do this, it's you.
426003 Taking on this task will be one of the most difficult things I'll ever do, but with the help of my friends–
426019 I'm sorry, Princess Twilight, but you must keep your new abilities a secret. I fear that your friends being aware of your new power could put them at great risk. Do you still think you can take on this responsibility?
426003 This is the role I am meant to play as a princess of Equestria! I will not fail to do my duty!
426019 Then we must begin at once.
426000 [magic noises]
426000 [wibbling noise]
4260db [shivers] That can't be right.
42626d What can't be right?
4260db Nothing. Carry on.
426000 [magic humming]
426019 [out of breath] It is done.
426000 [owl hoots]
426005 [snoring] You weren't gone very long. Does that mean everything's okay?
426003 Yep! Everything's fine! [chuckles nervously]
426005 In that case, I'm going back to bed. Sun's not up... and neither am I.
426003 [hushed] That's strange. The sun should be up by now... [gasps] The sun should be up by now! [inhales, exhales] You can do this.
426000 [magic noises]
4260db Shining Armor, why, whatever are you doing here?
426193 Back off, traitor.
42626d The only one Discord betrayed was himself. Abandoning his true nature to make friends with weak-minded equines who offer him nothing!
426000 [magic noises]
42626d [laughs, chews]
426193 [weakly] How... could you... do this...?
42626d Why don't you go and have a little fun? I won't stand in your way.
4260db [giggles]
426000 [approaching hoofbeats]
426000 [smash!]
42626d [inhales] What have you done?! [inhales] Where is your magic?!
426000 [explosion]
426003 I have to gain better control. I sure can't practice here.
426005 Uh, Twilight, [pants] where are we goin'?
426003 Oh, uh, hi, Spike. Uh, gotta go... somewhere... else.
426000 [explosion sound]
426003 Waaaaah! Whoa!
426000 [zoom]
42600c Whoa! Twilight?
426003 Yiiiipe!
426000 [crash]
426003 Ooh!
42600e Oh, my goodness, are you all right?
426008 Jumpin' junebugs, Twilight! When did you learn to fly that fast?
426000 [electricity crackles]
426003 I must have caught a particularly strong breeze... or something.
42600c Must have been "or something", because there wasn't any breeze up there.
426003 I don't know what happened, but I don't really have time to figure it out right now.
426000 [electricity crackles]
42600d Another visit to the Castle of the Two Sisters, I presume? We'd be more than happy to accompany you!
426003 Not today!
426000 [electricity crackles]
426003 Tirek may still be a threat. I need you all to stay here and encourage everypony to remain inside.
42626d Getting rid of your magic so that I cannot take it from you? That was your plan? How does it feel, knowing that soon, every Pegasus, unicorn and Earth pony will bow to my will, and that there is nothing you can do to stop it?
426019 You will not prevail, Tirek.
42626d Give my regards to Cerberus.
4260db You meant our will, didn't you?
42626d Of course. Here, I want you to have something. This was given to me by someone very close to me. I give it to you as a sign of my gratitude and loyalty.
4260db Oh, my! I do love a good accessory. I suppose that's Rarity's influence.
42626d [laughs] Amusing. But we have no time for such things. With the princesses out of the way, we can now– is this meant to be humorous?!
4260db Oh, no, I haven't touched that one yet.
42626d There's a fourth? And you did not tell me this?!
4260db I just needed some assurance that you truly considered this a team effort. And now I have it.
42626d Then where can we find this fourth princess? Where is her castle?
4260db Castle? [laughs] No, Princess Twilight lives above a library in Ponyville. Castle? [laughs]
42626d Not for much longer.
426008 All right, y'all. I think we've warned everypony to stay inside.
42600e I'm sure Discord will catch Tirek and this will all be over soon.
42600c I'll bet he takes his sweet time.
4260db Or perhaps these things just take time.
42600e [gasps] You're back! Did you bring the cucumber sandwiches?
4260db I did. I imagine they'll be your last decent meal for quite some time.
426000 [magic zap]
42601f [various exclamations]
4260db Ta-da!
42626d You've gathered up all of them?
4260db And her little dragon, too.
426005 [chomps]
42600e [crying] Why are you doing this? I thought we were friends!
4260db Oh, we were. But Tirek offered me so much more than just tea parties. Surely you saw this coming.
42600e [crying] I didn't. I really didn't.
42626d [inhales]
426000 [thud]
42626d You really think she'd do anything for them?
4260db If Twilight has magic to give, it will be yours. Soon there won't be a Pegasus, Earth pony or unicorn who will be able to stand up against us.
42626d Us? Who said anything about us?
4260db You did.
42626d You've helped me grow strong, you've provided the means by which I can obtain Princess Twilight's magic, and now you are no longer of any use to me.
426000 [magic noises]
4260db [weakly] But you said this was a sign of your gratitude and loyalty. A gift from someone close to you.
42626d My brother who betrayed me. It is as worthless as he is.
426008 Surely you saw this comin'.
4260db [weakly] I didn't. I truly didn't.
426003 I can do this.
426000 [magic hums, teleporting zap]
426003 See! Ha! Perfectly controlled teleportation–
426000 [many teleporting zaps]
426003 [growls]
42626d Princess Twilight!
426003 [gasps] Tirek!
42626d You have something that belongs to me!
426000 [thud]
42626d You're going to give me what I want! [inhales]
426000 [teleporting zap]
426000 [explosion]
426003 [screams] [gasps]
426000 [magic noises, explosions]
42626d Now I understand what your fellow princesses have done!
426000 [magic noises]
42626d [roars]
426003 [screams]
426000 [distant thud]
42626d [roars]
426000 [crunching]
426000 [magic noises, Tirek roaring in rage]
426000 [explosion]
42626d It appears we are at an impasse. How about a trade, Princess Twilight? Their release for all the Alicorn magic in Equestria.
426003 [gasps]
426025 [shouts of protest]
42626d What's it going to be, Princess?
42600c [muffled] Don't do it, Twilight!
42600e [muffled] We aren't worth it!
4260db [muffled] Oh, but you are, Fluttershy. You're the pony that taught me that friendship is magic. I had magic and friendship, and now I don't have either.
42626d Enough! I want an answer, and I want it now!
426000 [long pause]
426003 I will give you my magic, in exchange for my friends.
426025 [gasps]
42626d As you wish.
426000 [bubbles popping]
426003 All of my friends.
42626d After the way he has betrayed you, you still call him a 'friend'?
426003 Release him!
42626d If that's what you want.
426000 [bubble pops]
4260db Thank you, Twilight. [to Fluttershy, hushed] I'm sorry.
42600e I know.
42626d Your turn.
426003 [pained screaming]
42626d [roars] Yes!
426005 Twilight, what were you thinking?!
4260db Tirek tricked me into believing that he could offer me something more valuable than friendship. But there is nothing worth more. I see that now. He lied when he said that this medallion was given as a sign of gratitude and loyalty. But when I say that it is a sign of our true friendship, I am telling the truth.
426008 You think that might be the last one we need?
426003 We have to get to the chest.
426000 [various crunching]
426003 Together! I think we have to do this together!
426000 [keys turning]
426012 [gasps]
426000 [magic noises]
42626d How is this possible?! You have no magic!
426003 You're wrong, Tirek! I may have given you my Alicorn magic, but I carry within me the most powerful magic of all!
42626d [screaming]
426000 [Cerberus growls]
426000 [many magic noises]
42600d Sweet Celestia! Are you all seeing what I'm seeing?
426003 But... whose is it?
426019 I believe it is yours, Princess Twilight.
426019 You've been wondering what you are meant to do as a princess. Do you know now?
426003 As princess, I believe I have the power to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. That is the role I am meant to have in our world! The role I choose to have! But I didn't defeat Tirek on my own – it took all of us to unlock the chest!
426019 Then it is unlikely you are meant to take on this task alone.
426012 [gasping in awe]
426007 Wowee!
426019 You are now Twilight Sparkle, the princess of friendship. But what is the princess of friendship without her friends?
4260db Wait a minute, where's my throne?!
42600e I don't think you're quite there yet.
4260db [chuckles] Yes, well, I suppose not.
426003 [Twilight Sparkle]
426003 Each one of us has something special
426003 That makes us different, that makes us rare
42600e [Fluttershy]
42600e We have a light that shines within us
42600e That we were always meant to share
42604d [All]
42604d And when we come together
42604d Combine the light that shines within
42604d There is nothing we can't do
42604d There is no battle we can't win
42604d When we come together
42604d There'll be a star to guide the way
42604d It's inside us every day
42604d See it now! See it now!
42604d Let the rainbow remind you
42604d That together we will always shine
42604d Let the rainbow remind you
42604d That forever this will be our time
426000 [mandolin solo]
426003 [Twilight Sparkle]
426003 Let the rainbow remind you
426003 That together we will always shine
426000 [Princess Twilight's theme plays over credits]
501005 [snoring]
501003 Let's go through this one more time.
50100c [sighs] We've been over it like a million times, Twilight! We found all six keys, defeated Tirek, and got this sweet castle! End of story!
501003 Yes, but why?
501008 I dunno, sugarcube. Maybe it's just your new house and there ain't nothin' more to it than that.
50100d I must say, speaking strictly on aesthetics, there really doesn't need to be more to it. It's all simply divine!
50100e I agree with Twilight. And Rarity. And Applejack. And Rainbow Dash. And Pinkie Pie. Oh, and probably Spike.
501005 [snoring]
501003 As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville? It doesn't make any sense.
501000 [rumbling]
501005 [groans] Is that new? I like it.
501000 [theme song]
501005 This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!
501007 Hi, Mom and Dad!
501000 [stomp]
501000 [shimmering]
501007 [giggles]
50100e But if this is Ponyville, why are our cutie marks over there?
501003 I don't know. But it seems like the map wants us to find out. The Tree, the chest, this castle, and now the map. How can we not follow it?
50100c Y'know what? There's a ton of room for dangerous adventure along that route. Count me in!
501008 Aw, shoot, I reckon you're right.
501007 Well, I was planning on organizing my baking sheets, but okay!
50100d [sighs] Very well.
501000 [beat]
50100e Um, maybe I'll just stay here with Spike.
501005 Awesome! Me and Big Mac have a huge weekend ahead of us talkin' hoofball, and... and trading hoofball cards, and arguing about hoofball stats...
50100e O-o-on second thought, m-m-maybe I'd better go with them. In case they need me.
501003 Looks like it's time for a road trip.
501005 Well, suit yourself. But he's got a Hock Fetlock rookie card I plan to sweet-talk right into these hot little claws.
501000 [train engine chuffing]
501000 [brakes squealing]
501003 That's it! That's the place on the map!
50100d Right. Let's get down there and find the spa.
501003 Wait. We don't know why the map sent us here. We shouldn't just walk right in. It could be dangerous.
50100c Yes!
501007 Stay behind me, everypony! I'm on it!
501008 Careful, Pinkie!
501007 [grunts]
501000 [thud, scraping noises]
50100c This is where the map sent us? It looks like the most boring place in Equestria.
501008 It's just an ordinary village full of ordinary pony folk.
50100d It could certainly use a few more architectural flourishes. Or any architectural flourishes.
50100e I think it's lovely.
501007 I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. I know smiles. And those smiles? They're just not right.
501003 Forget the smiles. Look at the cutie marks.
50100c Okay, that's weird.
501003 An entire village with the same cutie mark? How can that be?
50100c I bet there's some sort of horrific monster behind it.
501003 What makes you say that?
50100c 'Cause fighting a horrific monster would be super-awesome!
501008 I reckon we just ought to head into town and talk to some locals, find out what's goin' on.
50100c Great idea, AJ. Let's go!
501007 Those smiles are bad news.
501270 Welcome!
501271 Welcome!
501272 Welcome!
501273 Welcome!
501274 Welcome!
501275 Welcome!
501276 Welcome!
50100e This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
501279 Welcome!
50100e [giggles]
50100c Ugh. Thanks a lot, map.
50127a Welcome! Pardon my forwardness, but are you an Alicorn?
501008 That there's the Princess of Friendship!
50127a Well, you've certainly come to the right place for friendship.
50127b What brings you to town?
501003 We're not entirely sure.
50127b I see. Well, all are welcome here in our little village. My name is Double Diamond, and this is Party Favor.
501008 Howdy, Double Diamond. I'm Applejack, and this here's Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle.
50127b And you all have your own unique cutie marks.
501003 If you don't mind, has there been any sort of... trouble here, lately?
50127b Trouble? Why, I don't think we've ever had trouble in our little village.
50127a It's true. You'll see. Hm.
50127b Perhaps you'd care to speak to our founder Starlight Glimmer.
50100e I wish everypony in Equestria was as friendly as these ponies are.
501007 I've got my eye on them. Something's rotten in... whatever the name of this village is that we're in right now!
501000 [knocking]
50127b Starlight, we have some new visitors.
50100c [to Applejack] Be ready to fight. We don't know what's gonna come through that door.
50127c Welcome! I'm so pleased to have you here.
50100c [groans]
50127b This is Applejack, Fluttershy, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, Rainbow Dash, and Twilight Sparkle.
50127c Forgive my bluntness, but I'm assuming it's Princess Twilight Sparkle? We don't get many Alicorns around here.
501003 Yes, but "Twilight" is fine.
50127c So! How did you hear of our little village?
501003 It's kind of a long story. Let's just say we found it on a map.
501007 Technically, it's a Tree-chest-castle-map!
50127c Well, however you found us, we're happy to have you! We're happy to have anypony who wants to experience true friendship for the first time.
501008 Say what?
50127c Oh, indeed. That's what's so unique about our village, you see. Around here, we don't flaunt our special talents because we don't have any special talents to flaunt.
501003 Is that why you all have those cutie marks?
50127c Perhaps it would be easier to understand if I gave you a tour of the village!
501000 [marching drum cadence]
50127c Heads high, ponies! Marching proud! [whistle blows] All together now! Every one of you! No pony left behind!
50127c Life is so grand in Our Town
50127c We're always filled with cheer
50127c We never have to look around
50127c To know that we're all here
5010fa [Citizens]
5010fa In Our Town, in Our Town
5010fa We don't have to wait
5010fa To find out that our destiny
5010fa Is just to emulate
50127c Let's see those big, happy smiles!
50127c Life is a smile in Our Town
50127c Our cutie mark's the same
50127c Because we do not separate
50127c Ourselves by more than name
5010fa [Citizens]
5010fa In Our Town, in Our Town
5010fa We dare not compete
5010fa Winning only breeds the worst
5010fa Ego-filled conceit
50127c You see? Now everypony wins!
50127c Life is a joy in Our Town
50127c We're all equal here
50127c No one is superior
50127c And no one shakes in fear
5010fa [Citizens]
5010fa In Our Town, in Our Town
5010fa We work as a team
5010fa You can't have a nightmare
5010fa If you never dream
50127c [Starlight Glimmer]
50127c Other ponies argue
50127c Do you ever wonder why?
50127c When you think your talent's special
50127c You don't see eye-to-eye
50127c There's just too many differences
50127c That lead to disarray
50127c But when you learn to act as one
50127c It's like a holiday
5010fa [Citizens]
5010fa In Our Town, in Our Town
5010fa We don't complicate
5010fa When you learn to simplify
5010fa Life is oh, so great
5010fa Join in our utopia
5010fa Come out of the dark
5010fa Banded by equality
5010fa By our cutie mark!
50100c [laughing] You're kidding, right? Give up our cutie marks? No way!
50100e Rainbow Dash, don't be so rude. I don't think we should judge them. They all seem perfectly happy with their choice.
501007 Don't believe their smiles, Fluttershy.
501003 I'm sorry, I guess we're just a little confused by all of this.
50127c We have no judgements here in our village. Each of us was confused once as well, blinded by the false promise of our cutie marks.
50100c Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is she for real?
501003 When we were sent to this village, we assumed it was to help in some way. But, well, it doesn't seem like you need any help.
50127c Have you considered perhaps that you might have been sent here so we could help you? After all, nopony has ever come to our village and wanted to leave. Why should you be any different? But that is entirely your choice. Please enjoy our little corner of Equestria. We're all quite fond of it. No doubt you will be as well. Double Diamond, please help our guests with whatever they might need.
50127b Of course.
50127c Well, this will certainly provide a boost to our little community. When the rest of Equestria sees that a princess gave up her cutie mark to join us, they'll finally understand what we're trying to accomplish.
501272 Welcome!
50127d Welcome!
501270 Welcome!
501003 A cutie mark is a representation of a pony's unique talents and skills. How is it possible to—
50100d [gasps] What in the name of Equestria is that?!
50127e Welcome! Care to sample some local fashion? We've got cloaks this month!
50100d [gagging] Wha— Ooh, er, perhaps another time, good sir, thank you. [whispering] No wonder nopony's wearing anything!
50100e [hushed] Really, girls! They may do things a bit differently than we're used to, but that's no reason to be rude.
50100c [hushed] No, the reason to be rude is that they all keep staring at us!
50127b Need something?
501003 Uh, no! We're good! [hushed] Fluttershy's right. If we're going to get to the bottom of why the map sent us here, we'll need the help of these ponies.
501008 I think we ran off to the end of Equestria before we even knew what that map was!
501007 If we were at the end of Equestria, we'd be sitting on a big 'A'! [giggles] Get it?
50100d Oh, please, Miss Pie! This is hardly the time for jokes! We've come all this way and for what?
501003 [hushed] Maybe you're right. But we're here now, and it sure feels like something's wrong.
501008 That and two bits'll get you a cup of cider.
50127f Is this a bad time?
50100e We shouldn't be bickering like this in front of our new friends. Really, Applejack, you're almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!
50100c Don't drag me into this!
50127f Is your friendship ending?
501007 Are you crazy?! We'd never let a disagreement get in the way of food!
50127f O-kay, well, my name is Sugar Belle. What can I bring you? We have - muffins...
501000 [long beat]
501003 Then I guess we'll take six muffins!
501007 Make that twelve! What? I'm hungry!
501003 [hushed] Come on, girls. We've got to stick together. It doesn't matter what happened before, we're here now.
501008 I guess you're right. And the sooner we figure out why, the sooner we can go home.
50127f Forgive me for overhearing, but just a moment ago you were disagreeing, and now it sounds like you're... agreeing.
501008 Uh-huh...
50127f Well, you had such differing opinions – and cutie marks.
50100d We have differing opinions all the time, darling.
50127f But you look like you're friends.
501003 We are friends. A simple disagreement wouldn't change that.
50127f I'm sorry, I'm just having a hard time understanding. Different talents lead to different opinions, which lead to bitterness and misery. So... why aren't you bitter and...?
501007 [choking] Blech! Mmmm... good...
50127f It's all right. I know I'm not a very good baker. At least, I know I'm not any better than anypony else in the village. Well, I... hope you enjoy our little village!
501007 [hacking]
50127f [hushed] Come inside before you go! Meet me downstairs!
50100c Okay, that was weird too.
501003 [hushed] Let's all sit here and eat these muffins and act normal. I think we're being watched.
501000 [scissors snipping]
50100c You think?
501003 [hushed] No, not like that! I mean somepony here doesn't want us talking to Sugar Belle.
50127b [chomp]
501008 I got an idea. But you gotta eat all of them muffins, Pinkie.
501007 Me?! Why me?!
501008 [hushed] You got a stronger stomach than any of us, and that filly in there might be our best chance at findin' out what the hay is goin' on round here.
501007 [chomping, stomach gurgles]
501008 [stilted] I can't believe you ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie! We'd best go inside and get some more!
501003 Nice work, Pinkie.
501000 [thumps and honks]
501007 I've accidentally eaten cardboard tastier than that...
501003 Hello? Sugar Belle?
50127f Thank you for coming!
501003 Why did you want us to come down here?
50127f So nopony could see what's about to happen.
50127a Are you really the Princess of Friendship?
501279 Do you know Princess Celestia?
50127f I love your cutie mark!
501279 How can you be friends with different cutie marks? Don't you end up hating each other?
50127f Oh, look at this one! This one's great too! I'd love to have my special talent back even just for a day! Make something besides those disgusting muffins...
50100c So what's stopping you? Go get your cutie marks back.
50127a Daydreaming is one thing, but you mean actually having it put back on? That seems extreme.
50127f I'm not sure Starlight would like that. She wants us all to be happy in our sameness.
501003 How do you take somepony's cutie mark anyway?
501279 The cutie unmarking is a beautiful experience! Starlight uses the Staff of Sameness to magically take them away and replace them with these.
501003 But nopony should keep you from your cutie mark. It represents such an essential part of who you are.
501279 Oh, we're not kept from them. They're in the vault up in the caves. We can visit them any time we like to remind us of the heartache of a life with special talents.
501003 Can we visit this cave?
50127c I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault. We hope someday every pony in Equestria will make a pilgrimage here to our little village to have theirs removed too, and our message of [continues under] perfectly equal friendship can finally spread across the land.
501003 [hushed, over] This must be the reason we're here.
501007 [hushed, over] "Pilgrimaging"?
501003 [hushed] No, helping those ponies get their cutie marks back.
50100e [hushed] Oh, are you sure, Twilight? Maybe they miss them a little, but even they didn't seem all that unhappy.
501003 [hushed] Then why did they want to meet us in secret? And why did they ask us not to tell Starlight who told us about the vault? Something's not right.
50127c Just through here! Behold! Our cutie mark vault!
501003 I've never seen anything like it!
50127c And here is the Staff of Sameness. It was one of the great Mage Meadowbrook's nine enchanted items. We are incredibly fortunate to have it here. This is the tool that allows us to free ourselves from our marks! I'm curious – how did the subject of the vault come up?
501007 Oh, some ponies were telling us how much they missed their cutie marks, and—
501003 Pinkie!
501007 Oops...
50127c [gasps] Were they? Well, it seems you inspire all sorts of free thinking, don't you?
50100d [laughs nervously] Well, w-we certainly didn't intend to cause any disruptions to your charming little—
50127c Good. Let's just make sure of that, shall we?
501003 It's a trap!
501000 [magic zaps]
501003 [groaning]
501025 [groaning]
50127c Aw. I don't blame you for what you tried to do here today. You've spent your whole lives thinking those marks are a good thing.
501003 Give them back!
50127c Well, now you can spend the rest of your lives here with us! And we'll teach you just how much better life can be without your cutie marks!
501000 [To be continued...]
501000 [credits]
502000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
502003 As princess, I've been chosen to spread the magic of friendship across Equestria. So why would the Tree of Harmony want us to sit in a castle in Ponyville?
502000 [rumbling]
502005 This is incredible! It's got all of Equestria!
50200e Why are our cutie marks over there?
502003 Seems like the map wants us to find out.
502003 An entire village with the same cutie mark?
50227c Welcome!
50200e This must be the most pleasant place in Equestria!
50227c I'm delighted you're interested in our cutie mark vault.
502003 It's a trap!
502003 [groaning]
50227c Now you can spend the rest of your lives here without your cutie marks!
502000 [theme song]
50227c [slightly muffled, over loudspeaker] In sameness, there is peace. Exceptionalism is a lie.
502000 [door pounding]
50227c Free yourself from your cutie mark. Choose equality as your special talent.
50200c [over] [grunting]
50227c [voice fades under] Difference is frustration. To excel is to fail.
502007 Hey, this is pretty good!
50227c [under] Be your best by never being your best.
502003 Ugh, we've gotta find a way out of here! I can't take much more of that voice!
50200d Oh, this is horrible! [crying]
50200e There, there, Rarity... It's not so bad...
50200d Yes, it is! Look at those drapes! I have no idea if they're tacky or not!
50200e Well, I think they're nice.
502000 [pulsing noise]
50200d [crying] So do I!
502000 [bird tweets]
50200e Oh, thank goodness! Can you help us, little birdie?
502000 [bird tweets]
502000 [pulsing noise]
50200e Go on, now! Fly away and get us help!
502000 [bird tweets]
50200e Oh, even tweets don't make sense any more!
502008 [grunts] This door's shut tighter than a... summer of...
502000 [pulsing noise]
502008 ...uh, piglets in... shoot! I can't even make countryisms no more!
502007 I don't know! Maybe it'll be super fun to be all the same!
502000 [pulsing noise]
502007 Sort of. More pleasant than fun, I guess...
502003 Something odd about that staff. I haven't studied Eastern unicorns as much as I should have, but I'm pretty sure Meadowbrook only had eight magical items, not nine. And I don't remember any of them being a staff.
502008 Well, it looks like you'll have plenty of time to try to think about it.
50227c [fading up, echoing] ...Choose equality as your special talent. Difference is frustration. To excel is to fail. Be your best by never being your best. Conformity will set you free. Accept your limitations, and happiness will follow. You're no better than your friends. [abruptly fades back under]
502003 I've got it!
502025 [exclamations of surprise]
502003 I know how we can get out!
50200c [sighs] Forget it, Twilight. This door's not opening.
50200d And I'm afraid the windows are much too small for escape.
502003 But there is a third way.
502007 Of course! Eventually the wind and the weather will wear down the walls until they start to crumble! Then all we have to do is wait for a big enough hole to form and we can just walk out! It's the perfect plan!
502000 [pulsing noise]
502007 I guess.
502003 We don't actually have to escape. They'll just let us out when they think we've accepted their philosophy!
502008 But they're never gonna believe we switched over in just one night.
502003 There's one of us they might believe.
502000 [beat]
50200e Oh! Me?!
50200c You've been saying how great this place is since we got here!
50200e But that's because everypony's so nice and their village is so pretty, and, and... Oh, you're right. They probably would believe me. I hate to lie to them. They've been so welcoming and friendly... aside from locking us in here and trying to brainwash us into abandoning the things that make us special... Okay. I'll do it.
502007 Woo-hoo! I mean, cool.
50200e But what do I do once I'm out?
502003 You've gotta find a way to get our cutie marks back.
50200e [gulping]
502000 [loudspeaker feedback]
50227c [over loudspeaker] Oh, good morning!
502000 [door opens]
50227c I trust you had a pleasant night? This way, please. There are some friends who'd like to see you. Gather round, friends, gather round! We've come to ask if any of you are ready to join us! There are so many friends to be made once you realize you don't need your cutie marks or the talents that come with them.
50227b We have a welcome ceremony for new friends! The whole village joins together to build you your own cottage—
50200c Not interested! You may have them now, but we're going to get our cutie marks back!
502008 Y'all don't understand, do ya? You can't force nopony to be friends! It don't work like that!
502270 Please, join us!
502280 We love new friends!
50227c It's all right, everypony. This is a perfectly normal part of the equalization process for those who haven't... quite seen the light yet. We'll try again tomorrow once you've had a bit more time to consider our philosophy!
50200e I'd like to join!
502000 [ponies chattering]
502003 Fluttershy? How could you?!
50200e If giving up my cutie mark means I get to stay in this lovely village with these lovely ponies, then I'll do it.
502000 [door shuts]
50227c We have a new friend, everypony!
502000 [ponies chattering]
50227c Now, there's one more order of business. It seems some in our midst might be... dissatisfied with the village life!
502000 [ponies gasping]
50227c Unfortunately, it's all too true, my friends! [to Fluttershy] Will you kindly tell us the names of those friends who so desperately miss their cutie marks that they would sneak around in the shadows talking to strangers about it? Just so we can be sure your intentions are indeed pure.
50200e [gulps]
50200e Um, I don't know who they were. Um, I'm sorry. I don't know your names and faces yet.
50227c Nonsense! Obviously these ponies must have asked you directly. Kindly point them out!
50227a It was me! It was only me! But I only wanted it back for a little while!
50227c And you're quite certain it was only you?
50227a I just wanted to remember what it was like.
50227c And no thought to the pain you'd cause your friends. Such selfishness.
50227a I'm sorry, everypony! I never wanted to leave the village! I love all of—
502000 [door shuts]
50227a What was I thinking?! I can't believe I even considered asking for my cutie mark back.
50200c Don't worry. Fluttershy will have us out of here in no time!
50227a Didn't you see what just happened out there?! Your friend has accepted our way! You will all accept our way! It's only a matter of time!
50200c This guy's a barrel of laughs.
502007 [flatly] Laughs don't come in barrels. They come from inside you as your body's response to delight.
502008 [hushed] So what are we gonna do while Fluttershy's out there lookin' for our [whispering] cutie marks?
502003 We have to stay as positive as we can. If Party Favor sees how much we really do like each other, even though we're all different, maybe we can use him to spread our message to the rest of the village.
502000 [loudspeaker crackles]
50227c [over loudspeaker] To excel is to fail. [continues under]
50200d Let's hope they don't convert any of us first.
502281 Welcome!
502271 Welcome!
502272 Welcome!
50200e Gosh, you really are the nicest ponies I've ever met.
50227c Come. All new friends stay with me until their cottage is completed. Let's get you settled, and then you can enjoy all that our little village has to offer.
502000 [rumbling]
50200e [coughing] Brrrrrr! [sighs] Get the cutie marks back. That's all you've gotta do, Fluttershy. Just sneak through the dark up to that spooky old cave with the scary magical staff and get the cutie marks back.
50200e Okay, you're doing great. The cave's gotta be close now...
50227c Excellent work, Double Diamond.
50227b Of course, but I don't understand why you wanted me to bring them here. Fluttershy is one of us now. Surely she can be trusted.
50227c This one belongs to a princess. It could be very important to our cause.
50227b But if Twilight Sparkle becomes our friend, then why do we care about this old cutie mark?
50227c I just want to keep them close until everything is... settled. You may go, Double Diamond.
502000 [door shuts]
50200e Oh, dear. How am I ever going to get the cutie marks back now?
502000 [crash]
50227c Ow!
502000 [bucket rolling]
50227c Ugh! Starlight, you clumsy foal!
50200e [gasps] Oh, no...
50227c I've got a good feeling about today! So, do any of you have anything you'd like to say? Aw, pity. Well, let's try this again tomorrow, shall we? No new friends today, I'm afraid!
50200e Wait! I'd like to lock them in.
50227c Marvelous, Fluttershy! That's the spirit! Party Favor, will you join us, please?
50227a I'm sorry, Starlight! I'm sorry, everypony! I've seen the error of my ways! I never want to look at my cutie mark again!
50227c It seems there's cause for celebration after all!
5020ec Hooray! [cheering]
50227a They tried to break me! They wouldn't stop talking about how different they are, and that somehow makes their friendship stronger!
50227c Such backwards thinking.
50227a But I didn't listen! I knew what they were up to, and I didn't listen!
50227c Well done, Party Favor! We welcome you back with open hooves!
50200e Um, Starlight? I think we might have one more friend joining us today.
502000 [crowd gasps]
50227c Is this true?
502003 I-I think so. But I just want to be sure. If I agree to leave my cutie mark in the vault, I'll really be happier?
50227c Just look around! Equality has given us more happiness than you've ever known!
502003 And you wouldn't let me just live here in the village with my old cutie mark?
50227c Out of the question. A pony with a different cutie mark in our midst would destroy our entire philosophy. We are all equal here!
502000 [crowd muttering]
50200e Then how do you explain this?!
502000 [splash]
50227c I knew you couldn't be trusted! No! Get away!
502000 [crowd gasps]
50227c Wha... What are you looking at?! They're the problem, not me!
50227a How could you?
50227b You said cutie marks were evil! You said special talents led to pain and heartache!
50227c They do! Don't you see?! Look at them!
50227f Then why? Why did you take ours and not give up your own?
50227c I... I had to, you fools! How could I collect your cutie marks without my magic?!
502279 But the staff has all the magic we need!
50227c The staff is a piece of wood I found in the desert! It's my magic that makes all this possible! You'd all still be living your miserable lives thinking you're better than everypony else if it weren't for my magical abilities! I brought you friendship! I brought you equality! I created harmony!
50227b You lied to us!
50227c So what? E-Everything else I said is true! The only way to be happy is if we're all equal!
50227a Except for you.
502003 Everypony has unique talents and gifts, and when we share them with each other, that's how rea—
50227c QUIET!
50227f You can't have a cutie mark, Starlight! Either we're all equal, or none of us are!
502000 [door shuts]
50227b Come on! Let's get our cutie marks back!
5020ec Yeah! [shouted agreement]
50200c Come on! Let's go get our cutie marks!
50200e Our cutie marks aren't in the vault! They're in there with her!
502000 [pounding]
50227b Stand back, everypony!
502000 [glass cracking]
502000 [magical zaps]
50200d Even without my cutie mark, I can tell this is beautiful!
50227c They think they can come to my village and disrupt my life? Let's see how they like spending the rest of their lives without their precious cutie marks!
502008 [grunting]
50200d [grunting]
502000 [whistling]
502279 Stand back, everypony!
502000 [crunch]
502000 [glass breaks]
502000 [door opens]
50200e They're gone! They were right over there!
50200c Look!
50227a [blows up balloon]
502000 [balloon squeaking]
50227a She's headed for the pass! If she makes it into those mountains, we'll never find her!
502007 These are amazing!
50227f There's a whole network of caves up there! Your cutie marks will be gone forever!
502008 Then let's get moving, y'all!
502000 [pulsing noise]
50200c Oh, come on!
502000 [jars rattling]
50227c Are you all so willing to give up everything because of these strangers?!
502000 [snow thudding]
50227f We gave up everything for you, because we thought you were our friend!
50200c I can't believe we have to count on these other ponies to save our cutie marks!
502003 If we hadn't come here to help them, they'd still be living under her rules! Now it's their turn to help us!
50200e And I know they can do it!
50227f My newest recipe – snow pie!
502000 [thud]
502000 [explosion]
502000 [balloon squeaking]
502000 [balloons stretching]
50200c She's gonna get away!
50227b Whoa! These are my old skis! This is where I first met Starlight!
502279 Maybe you can reminisce another time! She's almost to the caves!
50227b Feel like an air drop?
502000 [skiing noises]
502000 [snow thudding]
502000 [glass breaking]
502000 [magical zaps]
502008 Yee-haw! Finally, I can buck like a five-bit snake herder in an Appleloosa ranch house again!
50200e And you got your countryisms back, too!
502000 [magic zap]
50227c Wh– I studied that spell for years! How can you—
502003 I studied magic for years too! But what I didn't know then was that studying could only take me so far. Each of my friends has taught me something different about myself! It was their unique gifts and passions and personalities that helped bring out the magic inside of me! I never would have learned that I represent the element of magic without these five! And I certainly wouldn't be here to stop you now!
50227c Spare me your sentimental nonsense! I gave these ponies real friendships they never could've had otherwise!
50227b How do you know that?! You never even gave us a chance!
502000 [magic zap]
50200c She's getting away!
50227b We'll never find her in there!
502003 We just have to hope that when she's had a chance to think it over, she realizes that you all have taught her something.
50227a It's you who have taught us something. We all came to this village because we were searching for something missing from our lives. We thought Starlight had given it to us, but now... now it seems it was in front of us all along. It's us!
502003 Does that mean you'll stay in the village?
502279 It's our home. I'm not going anywhere.
50227b This is a chance for all of us to get to know each other again for the very first time!
50227f And I finally have a chance to bake something besides terrible muffins!
50204d [laughing]
502000 [ponies laughing and chattering]
502000 [Wilhelm scream]
502007 Now those are real smiles.
502000 [cutie marks pulsing]
502008 I'll never get used to that.
50200d I think it's divine.
50200e Does that mean that the map is calling us somewhere else?
502003 I have a feeling it means our work here is done.
502008 Looks like you were right, Twilight. The map did have a reason for sendin' us here. We brought real friendship to these here ponies. Guess that's why you're the Princess of Friendship.
502003 But the map didn't send me. It sent us. You're a part of me, all of you. And there's no doubt you're a part of my mission to spread friendship too.
502012 [laughing]
502007 This feels like an ending! It doesn't have to be an ending yet, right? 'Cause that Sugar Belle can bake!
502003 Maybe we can stay a little while longer. Come on!
502000 [orchestral music over credits]
503000 [scrubbing noises]
503000 [bear grunt]
503000 [bubbling]
50300e Phew! Thanks for helping me get them so fresh and clean, Twilight.
503003 No problem, happy to do it!
50300e You probably can't wait to get back to your castle and take your own bath, huh?
503003 Aren't there more animals that need cleaning?
50300e I think you and I are the only ones left, and I can't wait to get the mud out of my mane.
503000 [thud, splash]
503003 Oh, no! Angel got dirty! I'd better stay longer to help give him a bath too!
503000 [splash, scrubbing noises]
503000 [theme song]
50300e Thank you ever so much for staying to give Angel a bath too, but, um... I think he's dry.
503000 [floof]
50300e Goodness! It's gotten late! You really didn't have to stay all day. Not that we don't appreciate it. Isn't that right?
503040 [grunts]
50300e I for one am exhausted. [yawns] Plus, I really need to rest up for that big pancake breakfast tomorrow. [beat] And I'm sure you have to get the castle ready.
503003 No! The castle's... fine! But maybe I'd better see if Pinkie Pie needs help with the pancakes!
503000 [door slams]
50300e [knocking] Um, Angel?
503000 [Mane Six eating noisily]
503008 [gulps] Mm, these are delicious, Pinkie Pie!
503007 [slurps, gulps] Thanks! Twilight spent all night helping me pick the flavor! I kept thinking we'd found the right one, but she insisted I make even more to try. And more. And more and more and more and more! It was like she never wanted to—
50300e Leave?
503007 Exactly! [chomp] Eventually we ran out of time so we just went with every-berry-any-chip-surprise! [to Rarity, hushed] The surprise is I lost a measuring spoon in the batter. Somepony's gonna get a very special pancake!
50300c Up all night, huh? Is that why she's so, uh... out of it?
503003 [snoring]
50300e Um, I don't mean to sound unappreciative, but has anypony else noticed that Twilight has been a little too helpful lately?
503008 Now that you mention it, she was lendin' a hoof at Sweet Apple Acres the other day and stuck around 'til near midnight. Dug up fifty tree-plantin' holes when all I needed was ten.
50300d She spent an entire afternoon rearranging a single gem drawer at the boutique. An entire afternoon!
50300c You think that's weird? She raced me, like, a hundred times the other day. And lost every time! She just kept goin'! Best out of ten, best out of twenty, best out of a hundred! I mean, I know hanging out with me is awesome, but it was like she'd rather keep losing than—
50300e Leave?
50300c Yeah. Who does that?
503003 [snoring]
503000 [splat]
503008 Somepony who's avoidin' somethin', that's who. Soon as she wakes up, we're gonna find out what.
503007 [coughs] I win!
503003 Huh?! I'm pancake! I mean, awake...
503008 Uh, Twilight? Is there somethin' you wanna tell us?
50300d You know how much we appreciate all you do for us, and we simply adore having you around... but... we worry you might be... ahem... avoiding something else?
503003 Oh, has it been that obvious? I've been... the thing is... I know it's silly, but I... I've been avoiding... this place.
50300d [gasps] Why in Equestria would you want to avoid such a gorgeous castle?
503007 Yeah, this place has everything! Big tall ceilings that make you feel tiny! Shiny new floors that are cold to the touch! Brrr! And it even has loooong empty hallways!
503000 ["hallways" echoes out]
503007 Okay, I get it.
503003 The castle is amazing. But it just... [sighs] It doesn't feel like home.
50300d [chuckling] Oh, is that all? Why, you simply need to decorate, darling. Make this space your own!
503003 It's just so daunting! Look how big it is! I-I don't even know where to start!
50300d You can start by letting us do it for you. We will make this the castle of your dreams while you go to the Ponyville spa for some much needed rest and relaxation. I'm saying this with love, but... have you looked in a mirror lately? I've never seen you look this... mmmm...
50300e Frazzled?
50300d Yes! That is absolutely the word I was going to use.
503003 Ooh, I guess I do need a little help. And so does my castle. And I just know you'll do a great job, because nopony knows me better than you.
503008 We'll make this place feel cozier than hot cider on a rainy day.
50300c [gasps] There's gonna be cider?! [beat] Uh, I mean, let's decorate!
503005 Oh, no! Did I miss the pancakes?!
503000 [toy squeaks]
503005 I sleep like a baby under that cold, cavernous ceiling.
50300d Spike, I'm so glad you're here!
503005 Really?
50300d Yes! You're taking Twilight to the spa!
503005 Great! I've been meaning to get my claws done! [chews pancake] [with mouth full] Oh, you mean now. [chews]
503008 Come on, y'all! We've got work to do!
50300c [Rainbow Dash]
50300c Let's all work together
50300c To make this castle shi-i-ine
50300d [Rarity]
50300d Once we add some sparkle
50300d It'll feel, it'll feel, it'll feel...
50304d [All]
50304d It'll feel divine
503008 [Applejack]
503008 Crates of apples an' bales o' hay
503008 Just makes ya feel at home
50300e [Fluttershy]
50300e Furry friends and some popinjays
50300e So she won't be alone
50304d [All]
50304d And we'll make, and we'll make, and we'll make
50304d This castle a home
503007 [Pinkie Pie]
503007 There's nothing like balloons and confetti
503007 To greet you every time you walk through the door
50300c [Rainbow Dash]
50300c She'll need this and those
50300c Posters of all my heroes
50300c How could anypony awesome ever ask for more?
50304d [All]
50304d And we'll make, and we'll make, and we'll make
50304d A home she'll adore
50300d [Rarity]
50300d Bright curtains of flowing silk and lace
50300c [Rainbow Dash]
50300c This picture of me winning a race
503007 [Pinkie Pie]
503007 Party cannons to give her a surprise
503008 [Applejack]
503008 Hoes and rakes and some more garden supplies
50300e [Fluttershy]
50300e Getting hugs from this nice, big, friendly bear
50300d [Rarity]
50300d Decorate with some gemstones bright and rare
50300c [Rainbow Dash]
50300c More of this and that
503007 [Pinkie Pie]
503007 Don't forget the party hats
50300c [Rainbow Dash]
50300c How could anypony awesome ask for more than that?
503008 [Applejack]
503008 Let's all work together
50300e [Fluttershy]
50300e To show that we have shown
50300d [Rarity]
50300d Princess Twilight Sparkle
50304d [All]
50304d How we make, how we make, how we make
50304d This castle a home
50304d How we make, how we make
50304d This castle a home
50304d How we make, how we make
50304d This castle a home!
503000 [balloon pops]
503000 [animals chittering]
503008 [unconvincingly] Wow, girls! We did a... great job... together... [laughs nervously]
50300c We sure did... something.
503007 [simultaneously] Together.
50300d [simultaneously] All together.
503000 [birds twittering]
50300c [unconvincingly] Fluttershy, I love that you brought so many animals.
50300e Are these your trophies?
50300c I prefer to think of them as everypony's trophies but with my name permanently etched onto them.
50300d [unconvincingly] [laughs] My my, Applejack, bringing the outdoors inside, it's... earthy... What a lovely touch! [sniffs, heaves] Are these quilts vintage?
503008 Nope, just old! Unlike your sparkly window doohickeys which are... why, they're just swell! [laughs nervously]
503007 No one said anything about my hidden confetti cannons! [squee] Oh, right! They're hidden! [giggles]
503000 [door opens]
503005 Hey guys, how do my claws look—Sweet Celestia!
50300d Oh, Spike! Are you and Twilight done already?
503005 Don't worry, I ordered her the super-deluxe mane blow-out! She'll be a while. Man, this place looks terrible!
50301f Phew!
50300e Thank goodness somepony said something!
50300c It's pretty bad, right?
503008 This place looks like a mishmash of knickknacks.
50300d Hmm, I suppose it is a little cluttered.
503007 What are you guys talking about? I think it looks super fun!
503000 [confetti cannon explodes]
503000 [scared animal noises, myriad of thumps and crashes]
503007 Whee!
50300e Oh! Oh, no! Please don't do that! If you all just take a deep breath and calm down—
503000 [crunch]
50300d No! That bunting is embroidered by hoof! Don't you move one more paw!
503000 [curtains ripping]
50300d Everypony, stop!
503000 [thud]
503007 Okay, now it's a mess.
503000 [confetti cannon explodes]
50300c What're we gonna do?!
503005 I dunno. But Twilight's blow-out won't take that long. If she was avoiding the castle before, she'll never set hoof in here now!
50300c Come on, guys, we've gotta do something! Twilight's counting on us!
50300d Spike, you've got to get back to that spa and stall her! Whatever you do, don't let her come home!
503005 Like, forever? But we live here.
50300d Uh, yes, well, uh, maybe you could manage it 'til... sunset-ish? [bats eyelids]
503005 Anything for you, Rarity...
503008 Okay, we all agree the castle is too cluttered, right? So why doesn't everypony take one of their own decorations out and we'll see how it looks?
503099 [general agreement]
503003 Spike, you're back! How do I look?
503005 Great!
503003 And more importantly, how does the castle look?
503005 Great?
503003 I can't wait to go home and see it!
503005 Great! I mean, no! I mean, uh, I'm not... quite ready to go yet. Uh, why don't we have a massage? I was really hoping to get, uh... this thingy!
503003 [reading] The 'Extra-strength-hot-stone-deep-tissue massage'?
503005 [gulps] Yep!
503003 I think I'll just have a traditional massage, but you go for it.
503282 Did somepony order massages?
503000 [crash]
50317b Yeah! Let's do this, little dragon!
503000 [crash]
503282 Oh, I hate it when he does that. Come with me, princess.
503008 Come on, Rarity. Everypony has taken somethin' out except you.
50300d Ooh, I know! I simply can't decide.
50300c How about this?
50300d No! Not that! Anything but that!
50300c How about these?
50300d Oh, but those brighten up the whole room! They're my favorite accent!
50300c Then let's lose the curtains! The room wouldn't need brightening if they weren't making it so dark!
50300d Not them! They're my favorite too!
50300c [growls] They can't all be your favorite! Okay, I'm taking down the portrait. We all know what we look like.
50300d [huffs] Well, the room still looks a little bit cluttered, doesn't it? Perhaps I'll take down a poster or two. Only to be helpful, of course!
503008 Okay, everypony calm down. I'm sure we can find a way to remove the clutter together.
50300d You're absolutely right, dear.
503008 Hey, those are my warmin' quilts!
503283 Together!
503000 [balloons popping]
503007 Fluttershy, tell your birds to stop pecking at my balloons!
50300e I guess they must not like being scared out of their wits by exploding confetti cannons or something.
503007 But we can't get rid of the cannons! I don't remember where I hid them.
503000 [confetti cannon explodes]
50300d Allow me to help.
503008 Oh, no, I'll help you.
50300c Not if I help you first!
503003 [sighs] Great suggestion, Spike. I feel totally relaxed.
503005 [joints cracking] Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow...
503003 You want to hop on? Maybe I can get us to the castle faster.
503005 [cracks] Ow! I mean... how... nice is this day? I was hoping we could take the scenic way back.
503003 I don't know.
503005 Come on. Walking is good for post-massage circulation.
503003 Really? I've never heard that theory.
503003 [sighs] I really miss this place, Spike. We had so many wonderful memories here.
503005 We did, didn't we...?
503003 Oh, Spike, I'm so sorry. Of course losing the Golden Oak Library was hard for you too. [beat] I've got an idea. Why don't we have the girls add some things to make the castle feel more like your home as well?
503005 Really?
503003 Hop on!
503000 [thud]
503003 Ow! What are you doing?
503005 I, um... I just thought of what I want!
503003 Oh, okay. What is it?
503005 It's a... well, I want a... it's... I kind of need a... a bed!
503003 I thought you said you sleep like a baby in the castle.
503005 [scoffs] Everypony knows babies are terrible sleepers. Let's go!
50300d There! Now nothing is cluttering the castle!
50300c You're right. There is literally nothing cluttering this castle.
50300e What do we do now?
50300d I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but it's almost sunset. If we don't figure this out soon, it's going to look like we didn't lift a hoof to help her!
50300c Why is this so hard?! We're Twilight's best friends! This should be easy for us!
503008 She said it herself – if anypony should be able to make her feel comfortable in her new home, it's us. If we can't do it...
50300e Then Twilight will be stuck living in a castle that makes her feel... sad!
503000 ["sad" echoes out]
503007 Wow, Fluttershy! I didn't know you could be loud enough to echo!
50300d [muttering to herself] Can't believe I let go of the portrait... If it had just been me... [ducks under]
503007 What do we do? What do we do?! If Twilight comes home now, she'll be like "What did you guys do?" And we'll have to be like "Nothing!" And then she'll be like "I was counting on you! Some friends you are!" And we'll be like... [screams] [mocks crying]
503008 Calm down, Pinkie. We just need to figure out what we did wrong so we can make it right.
50300d Well, I didn't do anything wrong! I did exactly what I would do if this were my home!
50300c But it's not your home. It's Twilight's home!
50300d Where she keeps all her Rainbow Dash trophies?
50300c Touché.
50300e Maybe we're all a little guilty of making ourselves feel at home instead of Twilight.
503008 Come on, y'all. We just need to think about Twilight. What was it she'd loved about livin' in the Golden Oak Library?
50300e Oh, everything! The books, the smell of books, the joy she felt from organizing books...
50300c Remember that time I crashed into all those books attempting my sonic rainboom after you guys just cleaned up? [laughs, sighs] That was good times.
503008 Yeah, for you, maybe.
50300d Oh, and Applejack, remember when we were stuck having a sleepover there? That turned out to be so much fun!
503007 Remember the time it got blown up to smithereens?! Wait, no, that was the worst.
503008 We had a lot of good memories there, though. That's what made the Golden Oak Library home.
503284 Yeah...
503008 [gasps] That's it!
503003 How's that one? Too soft? Too hard? Too lumpy?
503005 Um... Just right! I'll take it!
503003 Oh, thank goodness. I thought you'd never find one you liked! Let's find a salespony and get out of here.
503005 Sounds good to meee—I... nn, um, uh, heh... did you hear that? [mimes squeaky springs] Too squeaky! Better keep looking!
503003 [groans]
503008 [sighs] Maybe my plan won't work after all.
50300d Of course it will, darling. I can see it! You and Fluttershy stay here. Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie, you come with me. We're going shopping! We'll meet back at the castle.
503008 [Applejack]
503008 It's not the things that ya gather 'round
50300e [Fluttershy]
50300e It's not how much you own
50300d [Rarity]
50300d The things that hold the meaning in your life
50300d Are the memories you've sown
50304d [All]
50304d So we make, so we make, so we make
50304d This castle a home
50304d So we make, so we make
50304d This castle a home
50304d So we make, so we make
50304d This castle a home!
503000 [door opens]
503003 Hello? We're home!
503025 Welcome home!
503003 Oh, I, uh... love what you've done with the place. You did such a good job of... preserving the integrity of the original design.
503005 Aw, come on! It looks exactly the same! Do you know how hard it was to keep her from coming back here?! I never want to see another dust ruffle as long as I live!
503003 Wait. Keep me from coming back here?
50300d [laughs nervously] It took a teensy bit longer than we thought.
503008 What really makes home feel like home isn't what it looks like. It's the memories you make when you're there.
50300d So we've made something that celebrates the memories we've made with you since you moved to Ponyville.
503000 [doors open]
50300e The ornaments on the chandelier are reminders of all the fun we've had together.
503007 That one shows your party at the Golden Oak Library welcoming you to Ponyville.
50300e The time we shared donuts after the Grand Galloping Gala.
50300d We were hoping that being able to look at your beautiful old memories would inspire you to make new ones.
503008 And the best part of it is, it's made from the roots of the Golden Oak Library, so you'll never forget where you came from.
503003 It's exactly what the castle needed. And I am ready to make new memories here.
503007 Then let's start right now with a new memory cake! Seven layer what's-that-flavor mystery surprise! These might be chocolate chips or they might be super-spicy black beans!
503003 Let's go to the dining room. It's a little sparse, but [door opens] at least there's a table and chairs. Whoa! What happened in here? Last I checked, this place was empty!
50300d I couldn't help myself! It was just begging for the personal touch!
503008 Truth be told... I couldn't either. Your kitchen might have some rustic farm decor, Twilight.
50300c And there may or may not be some Daring Do posters up in your library.
50300e And some stuffed animals in your bedroom.
503000 [confetti cannon explodes]
503003 What was that?!
503008 [sighs] One of Pinkie Pie's confetti cannons.
503007 What? It's not my fault I hid them so well!
503012 [laughing]
503008 [simultaneously] Oh, Pinkie...
503000 [credits]
504000 [knocking]
50400a Hear ye, hear ye! This meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! Who wants to do roll-call?
504000 [beat]
504065 I'm pretty sure we're all here.
504066 Yeah. Apple Bloom, what's this all about?
50400a Oh, nothin'... except this letter from Babs Seed sayin' she's got her cutie mark!
504105 What?!
50400a She says it's a pair of scissors!
504065 So... she's good at cutting stuff?
504066 Of course! She was always fussing with her bangs and tail! I'll bet she grows up to be a celebrity stylist!
50400a But if she spends all her time cuttin' hair, who's gonna run the Manehattan CMCs?
504065 Well, not Babs. She can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if she's already got her cutie mark.
50400a Oh, wow. I guess you're right.
504066 I'm glad she's happy, but I sure wouldn't want to be up to my flank in mane hair all day. Can you imagine getting stuck with a cutie mark you didn't like?
50400a No... or at least I hadn't...
504066 Don't worry, Apple Bloom. Most of your family has apple-related cutie marks. I bet yours will be, too. And what's not to like about apples?
504065 There's the core, and sour apples, and rotten apples, and apples with worms in them— What?
504066 Not helping.
504000 [theme song]
50400a I guess I just spent so much time worryin' about how to get a cutie mark, I never even thought about what would happen after. There's just so many things I never considered.
504008 I'm sure there are, but you don't need to—
50400a What if I finally get my cutie mark and I don't like it? What if I get my cutie mark and nopony likes me?
504008 Well, that's just ridicu—
50400a What if the Crusaders drift apart? I mean, we won't really be the Cutie Mark Crusaders anymore! [gasps] What if it's not an apple?! Will I have to move out?! Where will I live?!
504008 All right, that's enough, sugarcube. Those are way too many questions to answer all in one night.
50400a But—
504008 And nopony's gonna make ya move out.
50400a Are you sure, Applejack?
504008 Of course, I'm sure. Now get some sleep. You'll see. Everything will be better in the mornin'.
504008 Hush now, little sister
504008 You're loved by all you know
504008 You'll never lose their friendship
504008 No matter where you go
504008 There ain't no call to worry
504008 So don't you cry or fret
504008 A cutie mark won't change you
504008 No matter what you get
504000 [light clicks]
50400a [yawns] No matter what I get.
50400a [snoring]
504000 [rooster crows]
50400a Hoo-ee! Nothin' like a good night's sleep!
504008 [muffled] Breakfast!
50400a You were right, Applejack! I feel much better! I don't know what I was so worried about last night!
504008 See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about an— Well, no wonder you were so worked up!
50400a What? What is it?
504008 Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
50400a [gasps] I can't believe it! I got my cutie mark! I got my cutie mark! [rumbling and echoing] I got my cutie mark! Wait 'til I tell the others that my cutie mark is a... a... What is it?
504008 I have no idea what it means.
504285 [muffled] I know what it means! [breathing through gas mask] It means I can retire! [laughs]
50400a Infestations? You mean like... parasprites?
504285 Hah, please. Anypony with a trombone can get rid of parasprites. I'm talking about the serious stuff! You ever hear of... twittermites?
504000 [lightning cracks]
50400a Twittermites?
504285 Pest ponies like you and me are the only things keeping these live wires from destroying half of Equestria!
50400a Pest ponies?
504285 It's no easy trade! Even the best of us yearns for the day they can move on to greener pastures. Oh, now that you're here to take over, my day has finally come!
50400a Take over?
504285 You're gonna need to stop repeating what I say and pay attention if you want to learn anything.
50400a I'm sorry. I guess this just wasn't what I was expectin'.
504285 Don't worry. With a cutie mark like that I'm sure you've got the touch.
50400a The touch? Oh, sorry.
504285 Now, you're gonna need to be quick. Once these things get out, it can get pretty shocking.
504000 [twittermites buzzing]
50400a Wait, what do you mean?
504000 [zap!]
50400a Ow!
504285 Hah, told you! And the further apart they spread, the more powerful these jolts will get!
50400a What do I do?!
504285 Call 'em back, of course.
50400a Twittermites! [whistles] [calling yelp]
504000 [twittermites buzzing]
50400a Twittermites!
504000 [various zaps and vacuuming noises]
50400a Bugbugbugbugbugbugbug!
504000 [vacuuming noise]
504285 Well, looks like you're all set. Drop me a note sometime at the Piney Shade Retirement Community.
50400a Now, hold on! I'm sure this job is real important, but... I don't think I wanna call bugs for the rest of my life. Hey, where'd he go?
50405c Well, well, well! Look at the new bug pony!
50400a It's pest pony.
50405f Eh, it sure is! Ew!
50405c I might've known you'd end up with the worst cutie mark ever!
504060 [laughing]
50405f But look on the bright side! Whenever you need a friend, you can just go out and catch one!
50400a That's not funny.
50405c Heeere, friendfriendfriendfriendfrieeend!
50400a Stop it!
50405f Here, bug! Here, bug! Will you be my friend, bug? Because nopony else will! [laughing]
50400a You know what? My cutie mark isn't the worst! You two are!
504060 [laughing]
504000 [glass cracking]
50400a [sighs] I hate to think that Diamond Tiara is right, but... this cutie mark sure isn't what I was hoping for.
504286 Why should you have to keep it, then?
50400a Who's there?! What do you mean?!
504286 If your cutie mark bothers you so much, get rid of it!
50400a Well, if you know how to wave a hoof and erase a terrible cutie mark, you go right ahead!
504286 As easily said as done.
504000 [wind blows]
50400a Huh. Now that is some serious magic.
504000 [ponies panicked]
50400a Hey! Where's everypony goin'?!
504000 [ponies panicked]
504000 [Wilhelm scream]
50400a Mayor! What's goin' on?!
504010 Apple Bloom, you've got to get your family out of town!
504000 [burst of electricity]
504000 [twittermites buzzing]
50400a Twittermites! [gasps]
504000 [equipment clicking and clinking]
50400a Twittermites! Here, bugbugbugbugbugbug!
504000 [zap!]
50400a Here, bugs!
504000 [multiple zaps]
50400a Come on, here!
504008 Apple Bloom! What in tarnation are you doin'?!
50400a I'm tryin' to stop the infestation, of course!
504008 Only a pest pony can do that! Now come on! We gotta skedaddle!
50400a But I've gotta do somethin'!
504008 Are you crazy?!
504000 [twittermites buzzing]
504000 [zap!]
50400a [gasps]
504000 [zap!]
50400a Aaaaaaahhh!
504000 [rooster crows]
504000 [glass squeaking]
50400a Whoo-ee. That's what I call a nightmare. It seemed so real.
504008 [muffled] Breakfast!
50400a Applejack! You are not gonna believe the dream I just had! I guess I needed more sleep than I thought!
504008 See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix just about— [gasps] Well, no wonder you were so worked up!
50400a What?
504008 Looks like somepony got her cutie mark!
50400a Again?! I mean... I did? Woo-hoo! Potion making! Now that's more like it!
504008 More like what?
50400a Never mind. I'm just glad Princess Twilight's lessons finally paid off!
504008 I expect you want to run off to the clubhouse and tell your friends all about your new cutie mark. But before you go, make sure you do all your... chores...?
504000 [horseshoe clinking]
50400a Whooo!
504065 Why all the excitement?
504066 Yeah, what's going on?
50400a [coyly] Oh, nothin'... except this brand new cutie mark!
504065 That's amazing!
504066 Wow!
50400a I know!
504065 That's so cool!
50400a I don't suppose either of you got yours?
504065 Nope.
504066 Me neither...
50400a I know it's silly, but I'd always hoped we'd get our cutie marks together.
504065 Me too...
504066 But I'm still super excited for you!
504065 Absolutely!
50400a I know! [knocks on podium] Let's call this meeting to order! I'm sure the three of us can figure out how to get two more cutie marks.
504066 Um, yeah... the thing is...
50400a What?
504065 Well, you can't be a Cutie Mark Crusader if you've already got your cutie mark...
50400a Oh, yeah... Just like Babs Seed... Well, I could just sit quietly in the corner 'til you two figure out what you're gonna do...
504066 Well, technically the clubhouse is for Crusaders only.
50400a Oh. Right. I guess I should just come back later, then...?
504066 Why? I mean, you can't come in then either.
50400a Oh.
504066 Rules are rules.
504065 I don't even think we're still supposed to be friends.
504000 [door slams]
50400a What?!
504000 [creepy forest noises]
50400a Sweetie Belle! Scootaloo! Come on, fillies, this isn't funny!
504000 [wind blows]
504286 More trouble with cutie marks?
50400a No! I mean, w— yeah, I mean... Well, I got mine, but my friends didn't get theirs, and now there's all kinds of trouble!
504286 Sounds to me like cutie marks and trouble are two peas in the same pod.
50400a I guess so... I mean, if I was a blank flank again, there wouldn't be a problem!
504286 Your wish is my command.
504000 [wind blows]
504000 [crunch]
504065 Hey, Apple Bloom. Why'd you want to meet here?
50400a Well, us blank flanks have to meet somewhere!
504065 Um, actually, Apple Bloom, we... both sort of got our cutie marks.
50400a You did?! What are they?
504065 Oh, we don't have time to go into all that.
504066 And we certainly don't have time to hang out at an old clubhouse.
504065 Yeah, we've got responsibilities now.
504066 But maybe we'll see you later.
504065 Much later.
50400a Wait! Hold on! I can get my cutie mark back, I think! Rrgh! I mean, I got it once, right? Oh, just wait a second! Nooooooooooo!
504000 [rooster crows]
50400a What in Equestria's goin' on?!
504008 [muffled] Breakfast!
50400a I'm not so sure sleep is the cure-all Applejack thinks it is.
50400a Uh... Applejack? I know you said sleep is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm pretty sure it's makin' me feel worse.
504008 See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep'll fix— Well, no wonder you were so worked up...
50400a Wh— Didn't you hear what I said?! I was trying to—
504009 Weeeell, what do we have here?
50400a What is it, Granny? What's wrong?!
504009 Oh, nothin', right, Applejack?
504008 Right... Nothin' at all... Right, Big Mac?
504026 Truth is, Apple Bloom, it's your cutie mark.
504008 Eeyup.
50400a Oh, no! What is it now?!
504000 [spotlights turning off then on]
504026 [echoing] Well, I can tell you what it ain't. It ain't no apple.
504009 Nnope!
50400a What?!
504008 [in Big McIntosh's voice] And we don't have room for non-apples.
504026 [in Applejack's voice] Nnope.
504009 [in Big McIntosh's voice] Time for you to mosey on. You can't stay here.
50400a But this is my home!
504026 Oh, and you're gonna have to change your name.
504009 Eeyup!
504026 I think just 'Bloom' has a nice ring to it, don't you, Applejack?
504008 Eeyup!
504000 [wind blows]
50400a Noooooooooo!
504000 [thump]
50400a Ugh!
504007 [gives rooster crow]
50400a Alright, this is getting ridiculous. [pause] Whoo-ee! I never thought I'd be so happy to not get a cutie mark. What the?!
504000 [music playing backwards]
50400a [frustrated grunt] I don't wanna see another cutie mark as long as I live!
504286 Back so soon?
50400a All right, whoever you are! I dunno what spell you went and cast on me, but I want it to stop right now!
504286 I didn't cast a spell, on you or anypony else. I only did what you wanted.
50400a Rrrgh! Why would I want you to torment me with nightmares?!
504286 You didn't want to catch bugs, and I helped. You didn't want to lose friends, and I helped. If there's a problem with your family, I'm sure I can help with that too.
50400a I don't want your help! Just get away from me!
50401a Oh, Apple Bloom, you can't get away from your own shadow.
50400a Princess Luna?! My shadow? What do you mean? It's just me? You mean I've been doin' all this to myself?
50401a Of course, Apple Bloom. It's your dream.
50400a If I've been dreamin' this whole time, why don't I just wake up?
50401a Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare. I don't suppose there's anything you're particularly afraid of, is there?
50400a Yeah... I guess I've been pretty worried about gettin' my cutie mark.
50401a Well, that is the same as worrying about who you are. That is all a cutie mark is. If you cannot accept who you are, your life might seem like a bad dream. [blows]
50400a But if I like who I am, do you think other ponies will too?
50401a Of course.
50400a Then it doesn't matter what my cutie mark is!
50401a Indeed.
50400a But that's so simple! I must be the only pony in the universe this worried about her cutie mark.
50401a Oh, I wouldn't say that.
504000 [door opens]
504066 [exhales] [inhales]
504000 [cutie mark pinging]
504000 [bucket clunking]
504000 [door opens]
504000 [Scootaloo's wings flapping]
504000 [cutie mark pinging]
504065 [screams]
504000 [plop]
504065 [hyperventilating]
50400a Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle are havin' nightmares too?
50401a It's been a busy night for us all, but I think it's time to bring it to a close.
504000 [door opens]
504105 Princess Luna!
50401a I know you've all had a lot on your minds tonight, but I think Apple Bloom has something she'd like to share before you wake.
504066 We're still asleep?
504065 Cool!
50400a Well, I guess I should call this dream meeting of the Cutie Mark Crusaders to order!
504000 [podium honks]
50400a I know we all got pretty anxious when we found out Babs got her cutie mark, but I for one don't want to have nightmares every night from now until we get ours!
504065 Me neither!
50400a And even though we're all a little scared, a cutie mark won't change who we are or how everypony feels about us!
504066 It's lucky we're all scared of the same things. That way we can help and remind each other to just be who we are!
50401a And when the day comes that you all finally get your cutie marks, you can be sure they'll fit you to a T.
50400a Exactly!
504065 Do you fillies think that Babs is worried or scared about some of this stuff?
50400a I know! Let's put together a care package for her!
504066 That way she'll know she isn't alone!
50400a We wouldn't want her to think that just because she isn't a Crusader, we can't still be friends! But, uh... maybe we should wait 'til we wake up.
50401a Good idea.
50400a [gasps]
504000 [rooster crows]
50400a [sighs]
504000 [pancakes splatting]
504008 [Applejack]
504008 There ain't no call to worry
504008 So don't you cry or fret
50400a [Apple Bloom]
50400a A cutie mark won't change me
50400a No matter what I get
504008 Well, sure looks like somepony's feelin' better.
50400a You have no idea.
504008 See, now what did I tell you? A good night's sleep cures just about everythin'.
50400a I guess so. I just wish it hadn't been so exhaustin'.
504000 [credits]
50500c Look at that, Tank! Cloudsdale's here! That means Ponyville is next up for winter!
505000 [ponies running]
50500c You're doing awesome, everypony! Keep it up! We need those leaves off those trees! Once we get autumn cleared away, it'll be hello, winter!
5051f0 [yawns]
50500c Was that a yawn I just saw?
5051f0 [yawns]
50500c How can you be tired when the most exciting time of the year is right around the corner? And don't forget the best part – our first winter together! Come on, wake up! Once those ponies bring in the big, fat clouds full of snowflakes, we'll have a ton of snow for our extreme sledding! [cheering] And over there, we can play horse hockey, with no shoulder or arm pads!
505000 [imaginary crowd cheering]
505003 Everything's looking great, don't you think?
50500c Almost everything. Does Tank look alright to you?
5051f0 [yawns]
505003 Well, he does seem to be moving a little slowly.
50500c I know, right?
505003 And he looks kind of sleepy...
50500c Totally!
505003 ...just like he always does.
50500c Yeah, ha ha, I'm sure you're right.
5051f0 [yawns]
505000 [theme song]
505000 [heart slowly thumping]
50500c Well?!
50500e I suppose his heartbeat could be a teensy-weensy-eensy bit slower than usual...
50500c Okay, so give him a vitamin or something!
5051f0 [snoring] [yawns]
50500e I don't think he needs that.
50500c Maybe we're just staying up too late. Uh, too many Daring Do stories.
50500e Oh, that's not it either.
50500c Well, what's wrong with him then?!
50500e Nothing! He's perfectly fine.
50500c [relieved sigh]
50500e He's just going to hibernate.
50500c You do realize he's not a bear, right?
50500e [giggles] When the weather grows cold and less food is available, many animals hibernate to conserve energy. It's like taking a really long nap during winter, and then they wake up in spring. And see? Even tortoises do it! When the time comes, Tank will leave and dig into the ground.
5051f0 [yawns]
50500e But don't worry. He'll reappear when the spring sun warms the ground back up.
50500c Come on! Tortoises don't hibernate! Somepony put that picture in there as a joke.
50500e It's not a joke.
50500c Well, then your book must be wrong!
50500e Rainbow Dash, Tank needs to hibernate. It's healthy for him, just like sleeping is healthy for us.
50500c [short laugh] Whatever. Okay, thanks. Come on, Tank.
50500e Where are you going?
50500c To get a second opinion from a real reptile expert.
505005 I told you, Rainbow Dash, I'm a dragon!
5051f0 [snoring]
50500c Come on! You're practically twins!
505000 [beat]
505005 I'm purple.
50500c But if you don't have to hibernate, why should Tank?!
505005 Because he's a tortoise and I'm a dragon!
50500c Same family though, right?
505005 No!
50500c I'll take that as a yes.
505005 Ugh! Look, if Fluttershy says tortoises hibernate, then I guarantee tortoises hiber—
50500c Well, what would you know?! You're a dragon!
505000 [door slams]
50500c Nopony knows you like I do, Tank. All you need is some hard work to get the old blood pumping.
5051f0 [snoring]
505000 [thudding]
50500c Come on!
50500c [huff] These things are heavy! Chock full of snowflakes! We're gonna have such a killer time in the snow, Tank. Tank? Tank!
505007 Aww, look at the cute wittle Tankie, all snuggly-wuggly, getting ready to hibern—
50500c Don't say that word!
505007 Which one? "Snuggly"? "Wuggly"? "Tankie"? "Hibernate"?
50500c That one!
505007 I was just saying how cute he—
50500c If you think hiber... – you know, that napping thing – is so cute, why don't you go do it?! Somewhere far away from here?!
505000 [beat]
50500c [to rest of Mane Six] What are you looking at?! Pinkie Pie and I are just having a conversation!
505003 Look, Rainbow Dash, we all know how upset you are about Tank hiber—
505007 Shhhh! Don't say that word! That's what started this all!
505003 We all know how upset you are about Tank. But you shouldn't take your anger out on your friends.
50500c Who said anything about anger?! I didn't say anything about anger! I'm not upset! And I am not angry! Do I look angry?! [grumbles] Come on, Tank! Let's get out of here!
50500c I need you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, not sleepy-eyed and scaly-tailed! Which... is exactly what you are. But get up anyway!
5051f0 [yawns]
50500c You can't hiber– you know. What about all the primo things we're gonna do together this winter? Building snow ponies, starting snowball fights, sipping hot cider by the fire.
5051f0 [snores]
50500c Don't you wanna do those things with me?! Think, Rainbow Dash, think! Tank's only hibernating because it's cold, right? Well, I'd rather have him awake in the heat than asleep in the cold... [gasps] I just have to stop winter!
505287 So where do these clouds go?
505288 Over by Clear Skies.
505287 But there's clear skies everywhere.
505289 Yo, Clear Skies right here!
505287 But there's clear skies over there, too!
505289 That's Open Skies!
505287 There's open skies everywhere!
505288 I'm not everywhere. I'm right here!
505287 [sighs] Wait. So you're Open Skies, and you're Clear Skies. Then what's all that?
50528a Open, clear skies!
505288 Hey, where'd our fluffy clouds go?
505289 Fluffy Clouds? He's over there!
50500c Hah! Stopping winter is gonna be a breeze!
505000 [tree creaking]
505000 [splut]
50500c [Rainbow Dash]
50500c When life gives you lemons
50500c You can make lemonade
50500c But life gave me Tank here
50500c And my choice has long been made
50500c No winter will come to Ponyville
50500c I'll do it on my own
50500c I will keep you by my side
50500c So I will not be alone
50500c And I'll fly, and I'll fly
50500c Until the end of the sky
50500c So I'll be the one who doesn't
50500c Have to say goodbye
50500c I'll clear the skies forever
50500c So we won't be apart
50500c I'll keep the weather warm for you
50500c And the winter will never start
50500c Weather-makers Pegasi
50500c You make the seasons in the sky
50500c I don't want to sabotage you
50500c But you see, I've got to try
50500c No winter can come here now
50500c I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow
50500c I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be
50500c For I need my friend and he needs me
50500c I know it's wrong, but what does it matter?
50500c 'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now
50500c I'll change it all, it's only the weather
50500c And nopony's gonna bring me down
50500c I'll keep the sunlight shining free
50500c And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me
50500c And I'll fly, and I'll fly
50500c Until the end of the sky
50500c So I'll be the one who doesn't
50500c Have to say goodbye
50500c I'll clear the skies forever
50500c So we won't be apart
50500c I'll keep the weather warm for you
50500c And the winter will never start!
5051f0 [yawns]
505287 Here comes the next shipment! Move those clouds over!
505000 [metal raking noise]
50500c Ugh! For every hoof step back, they go three hoof steps forward! What are we gonna do? [long pause] Cloudsdale. That's it, Tank! If I can't stop winter in Ponyville, maybe I can stop it at the source!
505000 [click]
505000 [Mission Impossible-style music]
5051f0 [yawns]
505000 [whistle blows]
505000 [doors open, ponies chatting]
50500c Lunch hour! Perfect!
505000 [screws squeaking]
505000 [crash]
505000 [locker door creaking]
505000 [door opens and closes]
505000 [multiple thuds]
505000 [door opens and closes]
505000 [bubbling]
50500c The winter lab. We're in, Tank! Now we just gotta figure out a way to shut it down. Sabotage snowflakes? I think we gotta go bigger than that. Wait here. Hmm. We could get rid of these clouds, but... that's still not big enough. [blows air]
505000 [bubbling]
50500c Slam dunk! With no water, they can't make clouds or snow! They can't make winter!
505000 [magnifying glass clanking]
50500c I hate to do this to those weather ponies, but desperate times call for desperate measures!
505000 [metal straining, water rushing]
50500c Oopsies! Looks like these were a little loose!
505000 [water gurgling]
50500c And there goes winter down the drain!
505000 [clicking, powering-up whine]
505000 [fan spinning]
505000 [clank]
505000 [thud]
50500c Uh, I can't see!
505000 [wind blowing]
505000 [thud]
50500c Aaaaaah!
505000 [door slams]
50500c [groan]
505000 [jar rocking]
505000 [jar smashing]
505000 [electric zaps]
50500c [screams]
505000 [electric zaps]
505000 [pumping noises]
505000 [lightning zapping]
50500c Let's get out of here!
505000 [clank, air rushing]
505000 [pressure building]
505000 [electric zaps]
505008 What in the name of Celestia's goin' on up there?
505003 Prepare yourselves, everypony! Winter is coming!
505000 [wind blowing]
50509e [Wilhelm scream]
50528b [screaming]
505000 [valve squeaking]
505000 [pressure building]
505003 Everypony, look out!
50500c [screaming]
505000 [kaboom!]
505000 [spluts]
505007 [groaning]
50500d [groaning]
505003 [groaning]
50500e [groaning]
505000 [pop!]
50500c [groaning] You okay, Tank?
5051f0 [yawns]
505003 Rainbow Dash! Are you alright?
50500c [sighs] No...
5051f0 [yawns]
505000 [door opens]
505007 Knock, knock!
50500e How are you feeling, Rainbow Dash?
50500c [despondently] Whatever...
50500d The poor thing looks so sad! Just what are we doing to do?
505003 I don't know what we can do.
505008 Buck up, Sugarcube. You just ain't yourself these days.
50500c [despondently] Whatever...
50500d Uh, how can I say this tactfully...? You've lost your sparkle, Rainbow Dash.
505007 I hate to say this, but, well... you've become...! [hushed] A party pooper!
50500c Didn't you hear me? I said 'whatever'. I don't know if you're here to cheer me up or what, but I'm fine.
50500e Let me handle this. Rainbow Dash, your winter is going to be pet-less.
505000 [beat]
50500c [sobbing]
50500d Whatever did you do that for?!
50500e Because she'll never get past this until she lets it all out.
50500c [more sobbing]
505008 [awkwardly] Uh... it's okay. Tank'll come back in a few months.
50500c Months?! [crying] I don't want him to go! [continues sobbing under]
505008 Alright, alright. There, there. [hushed, to Fluttershy] Nice going, Fluttershy. How do we get her to stop?
50500e [hushed] She's got to be about done by now. Can't be too much left in there.
50500c [more crying, then stops]
50500e Feeling better?
50500c [sniffs] Uh-huh. [suddenly resumes crying]
50500e Oh, you poor, poor thing... [starts crying]
50500d [starts crying] I can't bear to see Fluttershy cry!
505007 [starts crying] It's just heart-wrenching!
50528c [crying hysterically]
505003 [to Applejack] You too?!
505008 Nope, I'm good.
505003 Look, everypony, I know how hard it is to say goodbye—
505007 [crying] I'm mostly sad because you're not sad!
505003 What?! Me?! What about Applejack?
505007 [crying] Applejack cries on the inside, Twilight!
505008 It's true.
50500c [settling down] It's alright, Fluttershy. It's alright.
505008 [hushed] You think she's done or just getting a third wind?
505003 I don't know... Rainbow Dash? Are you okay?
50500c [sniffling] I think so. I feel better. Really, I do. Thanks, everypony. I don't know what I'd do without you. [tearing up] Or him... [sniffs] Oh, Tank... I'm sure gonna miss you.
505000 [sledding and skating noises]
505003 Well, guess we're starting winter with a bang.
505008 The fun's come early! Yee-haw!
505000 [splut]
505007 You think we could mess up winter every year? It's way less work!
505003 Uh, I don't think Rainbow Dash could handle it.
50500c Riding that entire season from Cloudsdale to Ponyville was pretty awesome.
5051f0 [yawns]
50500c I thought you guys might like to say goodbye to Tank. He's ready to hibernate.
505007 Ooh, you're using the word! Oh, she's using the word! And when Tank finishes hibernating, I'm gonna throw him the biggest welcome home party ever! Or wait. Should it be a 'welcome above ground' party? Or a 'happy wake-up' party? Maybe an 'it's about time!' party!
50500d And I'll design him a very special suit just for the occasion, whichever one it ends up being.
505008 I'm glad you're feelin' a little better, Rainbow Dash.
50500c Yeah, me too.
505000 [digging in snow]
50500c So, you really wanna do this hibernating thing, huh?
50500d Goodbye, Tank.
50500e Happy winter.
505008 See you later, little feller.
505007 Have a good sleep, Tank!
505003 Goodbye, Tank! We'll miss you!
505000 [snow sliding]
505003 Well? Ready for some winter fun?
50500c Uh, I'm gonna hang here and read to him a bit. That little guy can never get to sleep without a bedtime story. I'll be right there.
505000 [credits]
50600a Aren't you glad y'all came with me to see Applejack compete in the Appleloosa rodeo?
506065 Totally! This place is a cutie mark gold mine! There's barrel racing...
506000 [klonks]
506065 ...roping contests, rodeo clowning...
506000 [thwack]
506065 ...steeplechase...!
50600a If we can get into some of these events, we could all three walk off the train back in Ponyville with brand spankin' new cutie marks!
506065 Wouldn't a barrel look good here?
50600a I want a lasso!
506066 I don't know... All these events look a little, well, dangerous.
50600a No risk, no reward.
5060a3 Alright, everypony, listen up! We need a big presence at this here rodeo, so make yourself plenty seen! I want that low-down varmint to know we mean business!
506066 I hope nothing bad is going on.
50600a A cutie mark-apalooza and a low-down varmint? This is shapin' up to be the most excitin' rodeo ever!
506065 Yeah, come on!
506000 [Western harmonica riff]
506000 [theme song]
506000 [bale being tossed]
50609c Woo-hoo! Yee-haw! That's my cousin! Go, Applejack, go!
506008 Whew! It's been a dog's age since I got to compete. All the rodeos 'round Ponyville are closed down for some reason.
50609c Well, I guess havin' injured kinfolk in Appleloosa sure paid off then, huh, cuz?
506008 Just doin' my best to fill your horseshoes, Braeburn.
50609c Keep tossin' like that and I'll be out of a job!
506000 [poink!]
50609c Ow, ow!
506008 Ooh, sorry. Say, where's my sister and her friends?
50609c Uh-oh. Gee, uh, I guess I got so caught up watchin' you that I—
506008 You said you'd keep an eye on those fillies! How am I supposed to focus on practicin' if you're not gonna—
50609c There they are! Heh, right where I left 'em... Aw, don't be mad! [beat] Owwwwch! My foreleg! Hurts so much...!
506080 [giggling]
506008 Y'all can't go runnin' off like that, y'hear? Backstage at a rodeo ain't no kind of playground!
50600a Sorry, Applejack. We won't wander off again. But, uh, speakin' of the rodeo... what would you say about me and the Crusaders maybe competin' in one teensy-weensy little event or three?
50609c Look out!
506080 [yelps]
506000 [myriad thumps]
506008 [gasps] What the hay just happened?
50609c You fillies alright?
50607f Uh-huh...
506066 [simultaneously] Yeah...
5060a3 Sugar and salt licks! Well, I'll be...
506008 What is it, Sheriff?
50609c Is it him?
5060a3 Ain't no doubt. It's Trouble Shoes.
506059 [Western harmonica riff]
5060a3 [surprised snort]
5060ec [shouting]
50628d Is it true? Is Trouble Shoes here?
50628e You ain't gonna shut down the rodeo, are ya?!
5060a3 All right now, I called for a meetin', not a mob scene. Now, as many of you know, the Equestria rodeo circuit has been plagued by the dirty dealin's of a notorious outlaw.
50628f He knocked barrels every which way at the Hoof City rodeo! Nearly crushed my Aunt Bae Mare!
506290 That's nothin'! He sabotaged the steer pen at Pinto Creek rodeo, settin' off such a stampede they cancelled the whole dadgum thing!
5060ec [shouting]
5060a3 Now, now, it's true we had an incident this mornin' at our own Appleloosa rodeo. Hay bale stack came down right near on top of three little fillies! I examined them hoof-prints myself and, uh... it was Trouble Shoes, all right.
5060ec [gasps]
5060a3 I reckon I oughta cancel this rodeo like all the others done. But dag-hoof it, this has gone far enough! We'll double the patrols! This rodeo will go on! Appleloosa ain't gonna be intimidated!
506000 [ponies cheering]
50600a Glad that's settled. So, uh, Applejack, about me and my pals competin' in the rodeo... [nervous chuckle]
50600a Don't send us home! It's not fair!
506008 Now, quit yer bellyachin'. I can't have y'all around here with some outlaw on the loose. Aw, maybe I oughta call it quits and go home too.
50609c No, you can't! This rodeo is important to Appleloosa! And with you in there, we got a real shot at winnin'! Come on, now, you head on back to practice and don't worry none about these three. I won't let 'em outta my sight.
506000 [door slams, locks click, chair drags]
50609c [to Crusaders] Ya hear? Y'all ain't leavin' my sight!
50609c [snores]
506000 [window opens]
506066 I thought we weren't going to wander off again.
50600a This ain't wanderin'. We know exactly where we're headed – to find Trouble Shoes!
506066 But isn't he a dangerous criminal?
50600a We only need to find him. We don't need to capture him. The sheriff can handle that!
506065 And once he's in jail, we'll be competing! And then it's...
50607f Cutie mark city!
506066 Worst idea ever.
506000 [owl hoots]
50600a It's another giant hoof print!
506066 Do either of you have any idea where we are?
506000 [lightning cracks]
506000 [rain starts falling]
506065 Uh, maybe we should head back and try again later.
50600a C'mon, before we lose the trail!
506000 [lightning cracks]
506066 [high-pitched squeal]
506066 Come on, we've gone far enough! It's time to go back!
506065 The rain is only getting worse, Apple Bloom! Let's come back tomorrow.
50600a Maybe y'all are right. So, how do we get back?
506066 You mean you don't know?!
506000 [lightning cracks]
506008 Whew! Good job, y'all. I know they need lots of mud for the rodeo tomorrow, but I wish they would've warned us about this rainstorm.
50609c [whinnies]
506008 Braeburn? Where are the girls?
50609c [nervous laugh]
506008 [echoing] What?!
5060a3 Ha! Fish my wish!
506291 Aw!
506292 Dagnabbit!
506008 Sheriff Silverstar! You gotta help! My sister's gone! And her friends too!
50609c I've searched and searched, but no sign of 'em anywhere!
506008 It must've been Trouble Shoes!
5060a3 Now, now, hold on there. Trouble Shoes done a lot of bad things in his day, but nothin' like that!
506008 You really wanna take that chance?
5060a3 Come on, y'all! Let's ride!
506066 You sure about this, Scootaloo?
506065 I thought I was, but now I'm not.
50600a So I pretty much got us completely and totally lost. How could this get any worse?
506080 [screaming]
506000 [splash]
50600a We gotta get out of this rain. There's no tellin' how long this storm could last.
506065 Look!
50600a It looks abandoned. Let's go see if we can find some blankets or somethin'.
506000 [door creaking]
506000 [lightning cracks]
506000 [hoofsteps falling]
506000 [door creaking]
506000 [lightning cracks]
506080 [screaming]
506293 [screaming]
506000 [multiple crashes]
506293 [multiple exclamations of surprise and pain]
506000 [thwack]
506000 [tinnitus]
506293 [groaning]
50600a [through tinnitus] Hello? You alright?
506293 Surely.
50600a We didn't mean no harm. We just came in to get out of the rain.
506293 Had some hot cider a-cookin' in the kitchen. Doubt it survived.
506000 [clang]
506293 I ain't gonna rise to greet y'all. Awfully rude, I reckon, but as you can see, I'm the fresh casualty of an unusually unfortunate circumstance. My lot in life, I suppose.
50600a Are you... Trouble Shoes?
506293 That's me.
506065 W-what are you doing?
50600a I'm gonna unwrap him.
506066 You can't do that! That's Trouble Shoes!
50600a Aw, he don't seem so bad.
506000 [lightning cracks]
506293 Of course guests would arrive while I ain't got no pie to offer. Scores more misfortune points for old Trouble Shoes. Wh-whooaaa!
506000 [crash, bonks]
506293 Typical. Bad luck never rests.
50600a You sure that's bad luck? Seems like maybe you're just a little, um...
506066 Klutzy?
506293 Tell that to the flank! Upside-down horseshoe – bad luck. Follows me wherever I go like sour on old milk. Y'all best vamoose before my bad luck rubs off and sticks to y'all. Get along! Skedaddle!
506000 [lightning cracks]
506293 Am-scray!
506065 Um, we don't really know the way back to Appleloosa...
506293 But o' course I do. Wouldn't you know it? My lucky day.
506066 It's actually kind of sweet of him to help us out like this.
506065 I know! What do we do if he takes us back to Appleloosa and the sheriff arrests him? If I get a cutie mark for that, I'll feel guilty every time I see it.
50600a Say there, Trouble Shoes, you might not want to take us all the way back to Appleloosa. The sheriff sort of has it in his mind that you're a no-good outlaw lookin' to shut down the rodeo.
506293 My kind of luck he'd think that.
50600a But... is it true?
506293 Y'all like stories?
506080 Mm-hmm!
506293 Just my luck. I was hopin' you'd say no. [narrating flashback] When I was a colt, I wanted to be a rodeo star somethin' fierce, but I just didn't seem to have the knack for it.
506000 [thwack]
506294 Whoooa!
5060a1 [laughing]
506294 [grunting] Awww!
5060a1 [laughing]
506293 [narrating] I practiced and practiced...
506294 Whoooa-oof!
506293 [narrating] And finally, I wrangled up the guts to audition for rodeo school. Right in the middle of that tryout, I knew I was doin' what I was meant to. And wouldn't you know it? In a flash comes this here cutie mark.
506000 [whip lashing noise]
506000 [thunk]
506295 [laughing]
506293 [narrating] I can still remember them judges a-laughin'. Didn't even finish my routine 'cause right then I knew bad luck was my fate. That fire for rodeo never did leave me, though. Couldn't keep away from 'em. So I'd sneak down and have a look, and wouldn't you know it? Bad luck would strike again. Just my lot in life, I reckon...
506066 Poor Trouble Shoes. I can't believe those mean judges would laugh at him like that.
50600a Don't you see? They weren't laughin' at him. They were just enjoyin' the show.
506065 What are you saying?
50600a Think about it. If we saw a rodeo clown doin' what he did back in that shack, we'd think he was the greatest!
506066 You're right! He could still be in rodeos, just not the way he thought!
506065 So he's been looking at his cutie mark wrong the whole time! It's not bad luck, it's—
5060a3 Gotcha!
506293 Just my luck.
5060a3 Trouble Shoes, you're under arrest for vandalizin' the property and peace of mind of the good rodeo-lovin' ponies of Equestria! Not to mention fillynappin'! And... generalized mayhem!
50600a Wait!
506008 Braeburn? Get these fillies someplace safe.
50600a Wait, no! Listen, Applejack!
506080 No!
50600a But Trouble Shoes isn't the menace everypony thinks!
506008 Sakes alive, what's with you? Why in tarnation would you want me to help get him out of jail when he's the one who ran off with y'all to begin with?! Now if y'all excuse me, I'm off to win the Appleloosa rodeo hay bale monster stack.
50600a Um, Applejack?
506000 [door closes]
506293 [sighs] Well, at least I get me a view of one small corner of the rodeo.
506000 [bed creaking, crash]
506293 Figures.
5060a3 Aw, come on now, Trouble Shoes! I'm runnin' out of mattresses!
506000 [magic fizzling]
506000 [keys jingling]
506000 [door opens]
50600a Come on, sheriff! You're about to miss the hay bale monster stack!
5060a3 Jiminy, that's startin' already?!
506000 [jail door opens]
50600a Let's go, Trouble Shoes! This here's a jailbreak!
506293 Ain't no need. Can hear the rodeo just fine from this vantage.
506065 But we've got a plan to help you live your dream!
506293 Listen, y'all, I'm a known criminal. How you proposin' on gettin' me into a rodeo?
506000 [bed creaks and clatters]
506000 [crowd cheering]
506000 [bale being kicked]
50600a Go, Applejack!
506065 [simultaneously] You can do it!
506066 [simultaneously] Woo-hoo!
506293 Well, how do I look?
506080 [giggling]
506293 Come on now, stack them bales! Woo-hoo!
506000 [bale being kicked]
506000 [crowd gasps]
506000 [crowd cheers]
50600a That's my sister!
506000 [entertainment music starts, crowd laughs]
50600a 'Kay now, Trouble Shoes, you're on!
506293 Say what?! I may be dressed like one, but I ain't no rodeo clown.
50600a You got your cutie mark all wrong, Trouble Shoes! You were born to entertain! You've got a gift for makin' folks laugh, don't you?
506293 But my cutie mark's an upside-down horseshoe, and that means bad luck.
506066 That all depends on how you look at it.
50600a You always wanted to be a part of the rodeo, right? Well, now's your chance. Go on!
506293 Whoa!
506000 [boing!]
506000 [crowd laughs]
506080 [cheering]
506008 There y'all are! How 'bout your big sis, huh?
50600a [flatly] Yeah, way to go.
506008 Since when are y'all so into rodeo clowns?
506000 [crashes]
506000 [crowd laughs]
506293 Just leave me be, cutie mark! I aim to clear that there hoop!
506000 [crowd laughs]
506000 [crashing]
506293 [muffled grunts] Come on now! [grunting]
506000 [multiple plops]
506000 [click, slide whistle]
506000 [crowd laughs]
506008 That's the best rodeo clown I ever seen! [laughs]
506080 [cheering]
506000 [pop]
506000 [muffled laughing]
506000 [splash]
506000 [pop]
506000 [crowd gasps]
5060ec Trouble Shoes!
506008 What the hay?!
506296 He escaped from jail!
506297 Ruinin' another rodeo!
506298 Let's get him!
506000 [crowd shouting]
50600a Wait, y'all! He ain't what you think he is!
5060a3 Stand aside, young'uns! This one's goin' back to jail.
506066 But he never wanted to ruin any rodeos! Those were just bad accidents!
506008 Sweetie Belle, what are you talkin' about?
506065 Trouble Shoes has a gift for making ponies laugh! He's maybe the best rodeo clown I've ever seen!
506299 That's true! He is awful funny.
50600a He thought his cutie mark was telling him to keep away from rodeos, but deep inside he knew it's where he was meant to be. He just didn't know how to do it.
506000 [crowd muttering]
506293 What she says is true. This here entertainin' y'all with my klutzin'? That's what I was supposed to be doin'. I know it now. I didn't mean no harm, honest! I just ain't never loved nothin' like I love the rodeo, so I kept on sneakin' back and makin' a big old mess of things. Turns out I was just a-lookin' at my cutie mark all wrong.
5060a3 That may be so, Trouble Shoes, but you still gotta face charges for the problems you've caused!
506293 If I done wrong, I'll see to it that I take my medicine and square my accounts.
5060a3 Truth be told, we could understand all the trouble with the rodeos, but why'd you have to run off with these here little'uns last night?
50600a Uh, yeah, about that...
506000 [barrel rolling]
506000 [sweeping]
50600a [sighs] You really want us to clean up all this mess Trouble Shoes made?
506008 Maybe it'll teach you not to go wanderin' off after I say not to!
50600a Ugh. Ain't it bad enough that you get to go back to Ponyville with a shiny trophy, and all we're bringing back is these same old blank flanks?
506008 Y'all helped Trouble Shoes realize what his cutie mark really means. Ain't that a nice feelin' you can take back with you?
506066 I guess we did make things a little better.
506065 It does feel kinda nice.
50600a So... we can stop now?
506008 Nnope.
506000 [credits]
5070db Ohoho, but that's not all! When I went to look for them again, they were on the ceiling!
50700e [laughs] Oh, Discord, I've never known anypony as funny as you! I love that story about the time you tried to train your right paw... [giggles] ...to fetch your left leg! [giggles] Oh, I do love our Tuesday teas, and I can't wait for you to meet my friend Tree Hugger. She's going to love you too.
5070db Tree Hugger? [laughs]
50700e I met her on a trip to see the Breezies. She's a member of the Equestrian Society for the Preservation of Rare Creatures.
5070db How nice for you. [chews teacup]
50700e We're all gonna have so much fun together at the Grand Galloping Gala!
5070db Oh, I was wondering when you were going to ask me. I'd love to.
50700e Oh. Oh, no. Um, I'm afraid I've already asked Tree Hugger. I'm sorry, Discord. I assumed you'd have your own ticket since you and Princess Celestia are friends now. Were you not invited?
5070db Who, me? It probably got lost in the mail. No biggie, as the foals say. Well, gotta go!
50700e But we haven't had any of our Tuesday teacakes.
5070db Well, I guess we're just going to have to exclude them from our party this time. Oh, did I say that out loud? I mean, ta-ta.
507000 [thud]
507000 [theme song]
507005 [snoring] Gemstones... [snoring] Gah!
5070db Where's Twilight?
507005 Uh, she's in Canterlot, helping Princess Celestia with the Gala!
507000 [magic poof]
507005 [nervous noises]
50700d Oh, your first Grand Galloping Gala! The excitement, the anticipation! I wouldn't miss this for all the jewels in Equestria!
507105 [singsong] We're going to the Gala! We're going to the Gala! We're going to the Gala!
507008 Alright, y'all, keep it down. It ain't like it's a life-changin' experience or nothiiiiing... [tearing up] My little sister's all grown up! [sniffs] [blows nose]
50700c Hey!
507080 [giggling] This is gonna be the best night ever! [screams]
5070db I don't suppose that, uh, these adorable little cutie pies have their own tickets to the Gross Gruesome Gala, do they?
50700a [blows raspberry]
50700d Ahem! To answer your rather rude question, they're going as our dates, our plus-ones.
507066 [singsong] We're plus-ones!
507080 [singsong] We're plus ones! We're plus-ones!
5070db Yes, yes, yes, I believe I got that!
50700c Yeah!
507007 Have a wonderful, special, fantastic day! Oh, hi, Discord. Want some cake?
507000 [!]
507007 I can give you a list of all the flavors we have in order of most delicious to incredibly, unbelievably delicious!
5070db Actually, Pinkie Pie, who are you taking to... I mean, do you... eugh, oh, you know what? I am famished. I'll take all the cakes.
507007 All of them?! He wants all of the cakes!
507000 [kitchenware clattering]
5070db Well, I'll need all my energy when I'm dancing at the Gala, if I decide to go that is. Oh, by the way, are you bringing anypony?
507007 Oh, of course! I was gonna ask my mom, because she's, you know, my mom, but it turned out she didn't want to go, so I started asking around and around and around, and I couldn't think of anypony, and I was about to just go by myself, and I realized, of course! Who loves fancy exciting affairs more than anypony else? My sister Maud!
5070db You know what? Cancel my order.
507000 [magic poof]
507007 You want none of the cakes now?!
50700e [laughing] Oh, my, you are funny!
5070db I guess every being in Equestria is funny today.
50700e Oh, how rude of me. Tree Hugger, this is Discord. Discord, Tree Hugger.
50729a Radical to meet you. Really digging your vibe.
5070db My vibe?
50700e It's a compliment.
5070db Oh, well, I'm sure it is. Well, I must be off.
507000 [magic poof]
5070db It has nothing to do with seeing you or not seeing you. You can rest assured of that. [laughs]
507000 [magic poof]
5070db Have fun at the Gala!
507000 [magic poof]
50729a Righteous!
5070db "Oh, Tree Hugger. You're such a great friend. So much funnier than unfunny old Discord!"
507000 [door slams]
507000 [glass shatters]
5070db "No, no, here. Take my plus-one. I insist. Before somepony else thinks he's my friend and expects to be asked instead. What's that? You're worried Discord might be upset?" Not a problem! I can make more new friends anytime I want. It's not as if any of this actually mattered! I don't even want to go to the Gala anyway!
507140 [yelping]
5070db Are you perhaps looking for me?
507140 Are you "Discord or current resident"? I can't find any street numbers in this place.
5070db My ticket to the Grand Galloping Gala! I was invited after all!
507000 [beat]
5070db [grimly] Why is this so late?
507140 Well, I got a little lost after I escaped the flying badgers... Can you point me in the direction of the bottomless pit? I think I can make my way back from there.
5070db Oh, over there. Somewhere. Just go over there. Looks like I'll see you at the Gala after all, Fluttershy. But I can't show up alone. She'll think that she's my only friend. Who could I bring on such short notice? [snaps fingers] [giggles]
507019 I must say, it's been very nice having you take over some of the planning responsibilities for this year's Gala.
507003 Anything I can do to make it easier on you.
507019 Thank you, Twilight. I am quite looking forward to just enjoying the Gala for once.
507000 [fanfare]
507124 Announcing the spirit of chaos, Discord, and his guest, the, uh...
5070db [unintelligible whispering]
507124 The Smooze!
50729b [slithering]
50700f [gasp]
5070db Good evening, everypony! What a glorious affair!
50729b [slurp]
5070db He does have a yen for shiny things, the rascal.
507003 I'll take care of this.
50729b [belches]
507003 [hushed] What are you doing here with... that?!
5070db Now, now, now. The Smooze may be an "it", but it's an it with a heart of, well, blob.
50729b [slithering]
507003 This night is extremely important to me, Discord. [through gritted teeth] Keep it under control!
5070db Yes, yes, yes, of course. Tell me, have you seen Fluttershy anywhere?
507080 We're here! We're here! We made it to the Gala!
50700e [giggles] Really? [giggles]
50729a The aura coming off the waterfall was so alive! So, like, magic manifestation.
50700e Wow.
5070db Oh, Fluttershy. I didn't see you there.
50700e How did you even know to look for an aura on a waterfall?
5070db [clears throat irritably, hacks, coughs]
50700e Discord! I thought you weren't coming!
5070db No. I actually never said that. But funny how you remembered it that way. Anyway, good to see you. Tree Friend, is it? Your name is slipping my mind right now. How strange.
50729a Nice to meet you. I'm Tree Hugger. Blessings.
5070db You have met me before actually! [snorts]
50729a Cool! Like, in another life, maybe?
5070db You've gotta be kidding. You don't remember me?
50729a [laughs] I meet a lot of different creatures, each one of them perfect and unique.
5070db Yes, well, as I was saying, it's just great to be here with my oldest, bestest friend.
50700e Am I really your oldest, bestest friend?
5070db You? [laughs] Of course not! You think I don't have other friends? I'm centuries old! I was talking about the Smooze! Smooze Face, the Smoozinator – well, I mean that's what we called him back in college. Smooze! I would like you to meet Fluttershy and, um, hmm... Tree... how'd you say it... Tree Embrace?
50729a Oh, I like that! It's so in rhythm with my life force! [gasps] Maybe I'll change it!
507000 [splat!]
50700e [giggles] I can't believe I've never heard you speak of the Smooze before. Sounds like you two are so close.
5070db Well, I'm glad you got that, because that's what is true. We are.
507000 [magic poof]
5070db Very close.
50700e That's wonderful! The four of us should go out to dinner sometime!
507000 [splat!]
5070db We should all go out to dinner sometime?! Have you no heart?
507034 [screams]
5070db Oh, oh! It looks like somepony wants to mingle. We'll be back in a bit.
50700e Oh, okay. Treezie and I would love to talk to you more later!
5070db Treezie? Really? Sort of a juvenile nickname, don't you think?
507000 [smashing glass]
507034 [screams]
5070db Smoozie! Wait up!
5070db Now, listen, Smooze. I need to make this a party of one for a little while. Just stay out here until I come for you.
507000 [door slams, lock clicks]
50729c [laughing]
507000 [magic poof]
5070db [laughing loudly]
50729a What's so funny?
5070db Exactly!
50700c Uhh... I think we're gonna go hit the dance floor.
5070db Fluttershy, tell the Hugs here about the time that we went to the store and came back with two cakes instead of one, because that's how crazy we are when we're together.
50700e Um, we went to the store and bought two cakes.
5070db Oh. Well, you kind of left out all the fun and frivolity there. But I'm sure you got it, Tree Hugger.
50729a I got that you really like cake.
5070db We like each other. That was the point! I'm actually pretty lukewarm about cake.
50700d [muffled screaming] Let me in!
507000 [thumping]
507000 [lock clicks]
50700d [gasps for breath] That creature took my jewels!
50729b [magical hum]
507003 Discord! I thought I told you to keep your friend under control!
5070db Oh, please. I have better things to do than to watch that thing all night. [laughs nervously] What I mean to say is, that thing is a dear, dear friend, and I'll make sure that the ooze, uh, that he can't help but secrete doesn't get on anypony else.
507000 [vacuum cleaner running]
507003 Thank you. It's alright, everypony. Let's just get back to enjoying this magical evening!
5070db [to the Smooze] You are making me look like a fool in front of Fluttershy. I'll be back when the Gala is over.
507000 [door slams]
50729b [licks]
507000 [magic poof]
50700e [laughing] Oh, Tree Hugger, I've never known anypony as funny as you!
50700f [gasp]
507000 [microphone feedback]
5070db Check, check, check. Is this thing on? Good evening, fillies and germs! I just flew into Canterlot, and wow, are my interspecies parts tired!
507000 [rimshot]
507000 [silence]
5070db I've only got these tiny mismatched wings, and even I can fly better than Twilight Sparkle! Am I right? Pchoo!
507000 [rimshot]
507003 Hey!
507019 [giggles]
5070db [laughs nervously] Uh, well, perhaps you're into more observational humor.
507000 [magic poof]
5070db Did you ever notice how you always materialize out of thin air? Why not thick air? What's the deal there?
507000 [rimshot]
50729d [coughs]
5070db Tough crowd.
507003 What is he doing?!
50700c I think they're... jokes?
507007 Maud! Jokes!
507242 My favorite.
5070db [muffled and out of focus] You might be a Ponyville pony when an ordinary night on the town ends in a lesson about friendship! [in focus] Knock knock!
507000 [beat]
5070db You're supposed to say "Who's there?"! This is the most basic of jokes!
507000 [thud, splat]
507242 You're the most basic of jokes.
507000 [ponies laughing]
507007 Good one, Maud!
507000 [colt trembling]
50729b [slithering]
507003 What is that?!
507000 [ponies screaming]
507000 [Wilhelm scream]
50700c [straining]
507000 [splat]
507000 [magic zaps]
507003 None of my magic works on this ooze! Can you stop it?
507000 [splut]
507019 I'm afraid not!
507003 Discord, how could you bring him here?!
5070db Oh, he's not that bad!
50700d Oh, my shoes will be ruined forever!
507008 That's what you're worried about? Really?
507000 [spluts]
50729a This is kind of a bummer.
5070db Isn't it, though? And to think, it would never have happened had I come to the Gala as somepony else's plus-one.
50729a Seems like something might have harshed his flow, you know? Like, his senses are agitated.
5070db You don't know anything about rare creatures. I've known Smooze Face for ages. He's not agitated. He's partying down! Whoo!
50729a All he needs is some, like, calming auditory therapy. I know I always feel really at peace when I'm being bathed in positive vibes. Maybe he'll calm down with some sonic bliss.
5070db Do you even know what you just said?
50729a Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
50729b [bubbling]
50729a Let go, Smooze! Bliss out! Ommmm. Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!
50729b [grins]
507066 It worked!
507213 [cheering]
50700c Way to go, Tree Hugger!
50700e That was the most magical thing I've ever seen done with animals!
5070db [grinding teeth]
50729a Oh, thanks, everypony. It makes perfect karmic sense why magic doesn't work on him. He only responds to vibrations that peace out his energy fields.
5070db Stop it! Stop it! That's it! I'm done with you, Tree Hugger!
50729a Oh, man. You're really bumming me out. Can you just, like, lower your voice a skosh?
5070db A skosh? A skosh?!
507000 [magic noises]
50729a Whoa, dude! What is that?!
5070db Relax. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm simply going to send you to another dimension. I can't have you interfering in my relationship with Fluttershy anymore!
50700e Discord, stop!
5070db I will, just as soon as she's gone! Then we can have a good laugh about this whole affair over our regular Tuesday tea. [sips]
507003 Don't worry, Fluttershy! We'll stop him!
507000 [disco ball bouncing]
507015 [screaming]
5070db I'm doing her a favor, Fluttershy! It's a lovely dimension! White sand beaches, attentive wait staff... I mean, okay, the humidity isn't great, but where isn't that the case these days?
50700e I don't understand why you're doing this! We were all getting along so well!
5070db As well as we could, considering you've already stomped all over our friendship by inviting her to the biggest night of the year as if I didn't matter at all!
50700e Did you really think I'd abandon you just because I have a new friend?!
5070db Yes, because that's what you did!
50700e No, Discord! I invited a friend to a party! I didn't abandon you! What if you had a friend that you could discuss chaos-based magic with? Would that mean we weren't friends anymore?!
5070db Uh... [stuttering] No, I suppose not. It would just mean that I'd have different friends for different things... Oh, oh, dear, it looks like I've perhaps overreacted just a skosh.
50700e More like a lot of skoshes! Tree Hugger, could you give us a minute?
5070db I'm just so new at this whole friendship thing. It's so much more complicated than it looks.
50700e Do you think maybe you owe somepony an apology? Not me!
5070db Oh! Oh. [clears throat] Yes, right. [snaps fingers]
507000 [magic zaps]
50729b [slithering]
507000 [magic zap]
5070db Er, Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you got caught in the middle of my... er, you know... wrath.
50729a Oh, it's all groovy. Um, I need like a few minutes to clear out my chakras before I can hug you from a place of authenticity.
5070db Oh, your chakras. [laughs nervously] Fair enough.
5070db I owe you an apology, Smooze. I spent the whole evening thinking about my own feelings and never thinking about yours.
50729b [kisses]
5070db Well, friends! I think I may actually grow to like this multiple-friend thing.
507242 I like it too.
507007 Hey, it's not a party until somepony spreads magic-resistant ooze uncontrollably over the ballroom! [squee] Come on, Smoozinator! Let's dance!
50729b [slithering]
507003 I'm sorry, Princess Celestia. I thought I could give you a break tonight, but it turns out I was in over my head.
507019 You have nothing to apologize for. This has been the most fun Gala in years!
507003 I know, it was a—What?! But there was ooze all over the place! And one of the guests threatened to send somepony to another dimension!
507019 I know! Can you imagine how dull it would have been if I hadn't invited Discord? Come on! Whoo! The night is still young!
507000 [credits]
508007 La, la-la, la-la! La, la-la, la-la, la la-la la-la! This is gonna be so great, Gummy! We have absolutely nothing to do today except bake! I've been waiting for just the right time to finally try Granny Pie's super-special triple-chocolate, fifteen-layer marjolaine recipe! It's gonna be amazing!
5080c6 [licks]
508007 Let's see. Nutty meringue, chocolate ganache, praline and nuts, cocoa-flavored buttercream...
508000 [cutie mark ringing]
508007 An hour per layer – that's fifteen hours of pure baking bliss!
508000 [oven opens and closes]
508000 [cutie mark ringing]
508007 Okay, Gummy, I think we're ready to start prepping the second layer!
508000 [cutie mark ringing]
508007 Oh, my gosh! My cutie mark! [gasps] You know what this means?! [hushed] The map!
5080c6 [licks]
508000 [door shuts]
508000 [door opens]
508007 Uh, Gummy? Could you take over for a bit? Hopefully this'll be quick. I'll just measure the baking powder for you... [squee] ...and when the first layer cools, you can drizzle some of the ganache over it. And don't forget to beat the egg whites for the meringue!
508000 [cutie mark ringing]
508007 I know you can do this, Gummy! You're the best alligator baker I've ever met! [kisses]
508000 [door shuts]
5080c6 [creaking] [thud] [blinks]
508000 [theme song]
508003 This is so exciting. The map is summoning you to Griffonstone, the very heart of the griffon kingdom! I don't know if either of you have read "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", but griffons were known to be—
50800c Rude, insensitive bullies?
508003 You mean Gilda?
50800c Yeah, I mean Gilda! When she came to Ponyville, she was a total jerk to all my friends, especially Pinkie Pie!
508007 She was a bit of a party pooper.
50800c Mm-hmm.
508003 So, maybe Gilda was a little rude. You still get to go to Griffonstone, and according to this book, it has a rich, fascinating history! [narrating] In ancient times, griffons were known to be as greedy as dragons, always hoarding their bits and other treasures. But all that changed when King Grover found the mysterious golden Idol of Boreas. Legend says the Idol of Boreas was made from the dust of golden sunsets, blown across the mountains by the north winds. Possessing the Idol of Boreas filled the griffons' hearts with pride. It's said that that one great treasure is responsible for turning Griffonstone into the most majestic kingdom of all the land.
50800c And why do you care so much about griffons anyway?
508003 It was actually Gilda's visit that made me curious. So I picked up "Bygone Griffons of Greatness", and I've been hooked ever since! And now... [sigh] Now you two get to see Griffonstone with your very own eyes.
508007 Huh? Just me and Rainbow Dash?
50800c Hey, you can totally take my place if you want. [yawn] I still have half a nap to finish.
508007 Why don't you just come with us? I mean, you are the Princess of Friendship.
508003 No, no, if the map wanted me to go to the coolest kingdom in all of Equestria and tour the palace and see the actual idol that unites an entire species, which would be super amazing, I'm sure it would've said so. You two can handle whatever the issue is just fine. I'll stay here and do important princessy things. I guess.
508007 Well then, come on, Dashie! We're going to Griffonstone!
50800c [sigh] Fine...
508007 That's the spirit! [blows party horn]
508000 [train whistle]
508000 [train chugging]
508007 Whatcha reading, Rainbow?
50800c [sighs] Twilight literally wrote a book on what we need to do in Griffonstone.
508007 You mean like a guide on how to figure out what problem we're supposed to fix?
50800c And then some. It's like Twilight herself in book form. [imitating Twilight] "Always carry plenty of bits. The griffons are sure to help you as long as you share the wealth."
508000 [bits clinking]
508000 [cart squeaking]
508007 [swallows] Uh, can I borrow some bits?
508000 [train chugging]
508003 [voiceover] Upon arriving in Griffon Gorge, be sure to pause and cast your eyes northerly, up the Hyperborean Mountains, taking in the breathtaking beauty of Griffonstone. Once in Griffonstone proper, go immediately to the palace and introduce yourself to the king. "Bygone Griffons of Greatness" was written a long time ago, and it ends with the coronation of the fourteenth king of the griffons, King Guto. I have no idea who's in charge now. Tell the king you've been sent by the Princess of Friendship, and you're there to help with some sort of problem. If for some reason the king can't help, I'd try the Griffonstone library next. It's a little known secret that if you befriend a librarian, you can usually find out anything. Plus, as a bonus, there's a statue of King Grover outside! [giggles] Photo op! And don't forget to sample some famous griffon scones. They're supposed to be the best.
508007 Aw, Twilight should've come along! Then she could see first-hoof that Griffonstone is...
508000 [beat]
508007 ...a total dump!
508000 [branch creaking]
50800c Ugh. Maybe the map should've called Rarity instead of us.
508007 Excuse me, sir? This is Griffonstone, right?
508000 [beat]
508007 Well, that wasn't very nice.
50800c See? These griffons are exactly like I'd thought they'd be.
508007 Maybe we should just find the palace so we can ask the king what's going on.
508031 We don't have a king, losers.
50800c Hello, Gilda.
508031 Dash.
508007 Pinkie!
50800c What are you doing here?
508031 Uh, I'm a griffon? What's your excuse, dweebs?
508007 Hey! These 'dweebs' are here to help Griffonstone!
508031 Help it what?
508007 Well... we're not really sure! But it involves a map and our cutie marks and a problem, and—
508031 Bored now!
508007 Well if you don't have a king, could you at least tell us where the Idol of Boreas is?
508031 Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really believe in that thing.
50829e You'd better believe in it! [coughs and wheezes]
508000 [thump]
508000 [door opens]
50829e It was the best thing to ever happen to us griffons!
508031 Oh, great. Now you got Grampa Gruff started!
50829e I'll tell you the whole tragic tale... [laughing] ...for a couple of bits.
50800c [sighs]
508000 [bits clinking]
50829e The first griffon king, King Grover, united our kind like we've never been united before or since! And he did it all with that incredible Idol of Boreas.
508007 [stifled giggling]
50829e That idol brought pride to the heart of every griffon that saw it! From one king to the next, Griffonstone had our golden idol. We were the envy of all other species. [narrating] It held us together – it gave us an identity – right up until the reign of King Guto.
508000 [lightning cracks]
50829e [narrating] That's when Arimaspi came to steal our griffon treasure! King Guto tried to fight him off, but Arimaspi managed to get away with the idol!
508000 [lightning cracks]
50829f [bellows]
50829e [narrating] They say when our treasure fell into the Abysmal Abyss, our pride went with it. King Guto was the last king of Griffonstone, and we all lived miserably ever after. The end!
508007 [tearing up] That was the saddest story ever!
50829e Aw, well... Tough tailfeathers! No refunds!
508007 No wonder Twilight's book ended with the coronation of King Guto. Who would want to record a history that sad?
508000 [thump]
508031 It's not sad! Do we look sad to you?
508000 [thump, scrabbling]
50800c Pinkie, I think I know why the map sent us here. We need to find the Idol of Boreas and bring glory and pride back to Griffonstone!
508031 Ha-ha. Here we go – typical pony hero complex. None of us care about that dumb old idol. Don't you get it? We don't care about anything, and that's the way we like it!
508007 I think Rainbow Dash is right! The map sent us here to fix some sort of problem!
508031 The only problem Griffonstone has is you!
50800c Well, I don't care what she says. We're gonna find that treasure, make Griffonstone cool again, and get back to Ponyville! Come on!
508007 Wait, Rainbow Dash. What about Twilight's advice?
50800c What, taking a bunch of pictures?
508007 She mentioned finding answers at the library.
508000 [thwap]
50800c Knock yourself out. But when you get bored with Twilight's tour book, I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss finding the Idol of Boreas.
508000 [door opening]
50800c I'm here to find your missing idol and save Griffonstone!
508000 [beat]
508000 [door breaks]
50800c Uh, I'll need some rope, a grappling hook, and a guide to take me down to the Abysmal Abyss.
5082a0 And I'll need some bits.
508007 Hey, Gilda! Word on the street is that Griffonstone has an amazing library chock-full of answers!
508031 Word on what street?
508007 Okay, maybe not this street, but on other streets, your library is the talk of the town.
508031 The library's right there, so why don't you go inside and leave me alone?!
508000 [cart rattling]
508007 [gasps] Maybe it's good that Twilight didn't come... [to statue] It's sad what happened to your town, King, but Rainbow Dash can't be right. This can't all be because of a missing hunk of gold. [as King Grover] You are right, Pinkie! And you've got amazing hair! [normal] Aw, King Grover, you old charmer!
508000 [statue breaks]
508000 [bonk!]
508007 [gasps] I know what Griffonstone needs!
508031 Fewer ponies?
508007 A song! I've got a super song about smiling that sure to make even the most grumpy griffon grin! [inhales]
508031 Can't sing here!
508007 But how do you break into uplifting musical numbers with no singing?
508031 Yeah, that's Griffonstone's biggest problem – lack of uplifting musical numbers.
508007 Well if I can't sing, how about a party? If there's one thing these griffons need, it's a good cheer! Where's your party store?
508000 [beat]
508007 No party store? Uh, how about cake? Nothing cheers folks up like cake! Where's a bakery?
508031 Ugh.
508007 No singing, no party store, no bakery?! What is this place?!
508031 You're welcome to leave [suddenly yelling] at any time!
508000 [crash]
508000 [thump]
508007 Well, that just takes the cake. Wait, no! It can't take the cake 'cause there is no cake! Or muffins! Or griffon scones!
508031 Oh, we got griffon scones. That's my specialty.
508007 I'll buy one! [chomp]
508031 Bits first!
508000 [bit clinking]
508007 [crunching]
508031 Well?
508007 [crunching]
508031 What, you like it? That's my Grampa Gruff's secret recipe.
508007 [with mouth full] Ow! I think I broke a tooth!
508031 Well, whatever. No refunds. I don't even care anyway. I just want to sell enough of these so that I can leave this lousy town.
508007 [spits] I can help you with that!
508000 [wind blowing]
50800c Uh, you think you could tighten the strap on my helmet?
5082a0 Can you give me more bits?
50800c [sighs] Never mind, I got it. So how deep is this abyss?
5082a0 How deep are your pockets?
50800c Don't you griffons ever talk about anything but bits?
5082a0 Gimme some bits and I'll answer.
50800c No wonder Gilda's such a delight.
508007 [chewing] Grampa Gruff's recipe is good, but it's missing one important ingredient.
508031 Don't tell me. "Friendship"?
508007 Uh, no. Baking powder. Lucky for you, I never leave home without it! Now just pop those in the oven, and you'll have griffon scones worth their weight in gold!
5082a1 [sniffing]
508000 [bonk!]
508000 [thud]
508031 Greta!
508007 Aha! I saw that, Gilda! You may act like a gruff, grumbling griffon, but inside you're gracious and great!
508031 What are you talking about?
508007 You just helped your friend up when she got knocked down.
508031 What, her? Greta's just some griffon I know. We don't have friends here! [sighs] I did have a friend once, but you saw how that turned out.
508007 [poink!] [slide whistle noise] Oh, my gosh, I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!
508031 See ya.
508000 [wind blowing]
50800c [shouting] You sure we can't just fly down? Whoa! Never mind, totally got my answer there.
50800c Just gotta find that golden idol and get out of this place.
508000 [rope snaps]
50800c [screaming] Whoooa!
508000 [thump]
50800c Ow, ooh! My hoof! Help! Throw me another rope!
5082a0 You got bits?
50800c Wait! Heeeeeelp...! [fades into distance]
508000 [bandage tightening]
508000 [wind blowing]
508000 [thump]
50800c [frustrated yell]
508007 [in distance] There you are! Forget about finding the idol! I figured out how to solve Griffonstone's real problem – scones!
50800c Pinkie Pie, you get back here!
508007 [in distance] Yeah?
50800c [in distance] Can you throw down a rope or something?
508007 [in distance] Lemme look!
508000 [beat]
508007 One rope coming up!
50800c [grumbles]
508007 We need help. Don't go anywhere!
50800c [sighs] Where does she think I'm gonna go?
508000 [rock crumbles]
50800c [panicked noises] I hope I don't go anywhere!
508000 [scones sizzling]
508031 [chewing]
508007 Rainbow Dash is stuck on a ledge in the Abysmal Abyss, and I need your help to save her!
508031 Not my problem.
508007 Of course it's your problem! She's your friend!
508031 Used to be.
508007 Can't you remember when she was?
508031 Yeah. Of course.
5080b6 Doesn't that griffon know she's supposed to fly at the Junior Speedsters Flight Camp?
5080b7 Maybe she just doesn't want to make you look bad! Hey there, I'm Rainbow Dash! And you are...?
5082a2 Uh... G-G-G-G-Gilda.
5080b7 You sure about that? Stick with me, Gilda, and those guys won't give you any more guff. Whoa! You're awesome!
5082a2 [laughing] You too, Rainbow Dash!
5080b7 Well, Gilda, let's show these guys how it's done!
508000 [bowling pins clatter]
5082a2 Junior Speedsters are our lives,
5080b7 Skybound soars and daring dives,
5082a3 Junior Speedsters, it's our quest to someday be the very best!
508031 Fine. I'll help her. But that doesn't make me her friend.
508007 Duly noted. [to the audience] Except it does!
508000 [rock crumbling]
508000 [wind blowing]
508031 Hang on, loser! I'm coming!
50800c What took you so long, doofus?!
508000 [rock crumbling]
50800c [screaming]
508007 Rainbow Dash! I'm coming for you!
50800c [screaming]
508007 Gotcha!
5082a4 [screaming]
508000 [thump]
508030 [grunting]
508031 Hold on, you two! [grunting] Huh? [gasps]
508000 [metallic glint]
508031 The Idol of Boreas! [grunting]
50800c I'm slipping!
508031 [straining]
508030 [screaming]
508031 [grunting]
508000 [thump]
508000 [chink!]
50800c The idol!
508031 You're more important to me than some dumb chunk of gold.
508000 [rock crumbling]
508007 Hugging later, climbing now!
508031 I'm really sorry about how I treated you two.
50800c Thanks, Gilda.
508007 Apology accepted.
50800c And I'm just sorry we didn't get your idol back. Now we'll never be able to solve Griffonstone's problem.
508007 That's what I was trying to tell you! The map didn't send us here to find the lost Idol of Boreas. It sent us here to replace it with something better!
508031 Nothing's better than gold to a griffon.
508007 That's because you don't have friendship! If you can learn to care about each other again, Griffonstone could be a mightier kingdom than it ever was before! And you don't need some golden idol to do that. You just need each other.
50800c Whoa, Pinkie. That was... really sappy.
508007 Eh, what can I say? That's how I roll. Go on, Gilda! Go make a friend!
50800c I don't know, Pinkie. You really think these griffons are up for this? We aren't exactly in Ponyville, you know.
508031 Okay, so she was really weirded out until I gave her the scone. Then she tried it and said it tasted good! That's the first nice thing anygriffon's ever said to me!
508000 [cutie marks ringing]
50800c Whoa, Pinkie. I guess that really was the problem we needed to solve.
508007 [in film reel quality] Baking powder makes baked goods and friendships fluffy and delicious! [squee]
50800c Well, we'd better be heading home.
508031 What? Y-Y-You want me to spread friendship here by myself?! How am I supposed to do that?! I haven't even made one single friend yet!
50800c No, you haven't. You've made two.
508007 [tearing up] Hugging! Hugging now!
508031 But you'll come back and visit, right?
50800c Just try and stop us!
508000 [creeeak, pop!]
508007 [to statue] See ya later, you old charmer.
50800c Uh, Pinkie? Who are you talking to?
508007 Nopony! Come on, let's go home and see how Gummy did with Granny Pie's marjolaine recipe!
5080c6 [blinks]
508000 [credits]
509000 [pages turning]
509000 [door opens]
50915c I'll never understand the ponies in this town! Everywhere I went, they were all gussied up and lookin' at me funny! Kept asking if I was "nervous"!
50915b Did they forget the wedding is tomorrow?
50915c Oh, maybe they're just as excited for us to be married as I am.
50915d [murmuring and giggling]
50915b Well, they're going to feel awfully silly when they realize they've got the wrong date. [gasps] The invitations are wrong! This says the wedding is today!
50915c But I got such a good deal on them...
50915b Everypony in town got these! The princesses have even RSVP'd!
50915c I told you we should have eloped!
50915b Oh, dear. The caterer, the flowers, the musicians! We've got to move it all to today!
50915c What?!
509000 [door opens]
50915b Where's my wedding planner?!
50915c You told me you could do it for half what the others charged, and then you sent the invitations to everypony in town with the wrong date! [snorts]
50913d Muffin?
509000 [theme song]
50913d I really messed up on those invitations! I feel just awful, Doc!
509020 Hmph! Perhaps that explains why I never got mine!
50913d I told Cranky I could get 'em printed for cheap, but that meant hiring somepony with no experience using a printing press.
509000 [printing press exploding]
509000 [squirt]
50913d Oh, I wish there was a way I could go back in time and fix all this.
509061 [slurping]
509061 Going back in time is old thinking, my friend. I was working off a cutting-edge theory of making time come forward to you.
509000 [clunking]
509061 My life's work, decades – centuries, really – of research and experimentation, and I nearly had it cracked! Turns out there's a magic spell for it. Who knew?
509000 [zap]
509000 [zap]
509061 But there are so many things that magic can't explain, where science and mathematics are the real magic!
50913d Like these? They're pretty.
509061 Ah, yes, my flameless fireworks. I never could quite figure out how to get them to ignite.
50913d How did you learn to make all this stuff anyway?
509061 I've been studying science my whole life. Ever since a particularly traumatic experience as a foal, I've been looking for ways to make sense of the world around me. Science provides explanations of things we never thought possible! Now, why did we come here again?
50913d Yeah. Oh! Because I accidentally sent out invitations for Cranky and Matilda's wedding with today's date instead of tomorrow's!
509061 Great whickering stallions! I completely forgot! And I still need to get my suit tailored!
509061 Rarity? [knocking] Rarity! [grumbling]
509000 [hip-hop playing in headphones]
509061 [to DJ Pon-3] Please! You've got to help me! I lost track of time, unbelievably, and forgot that the wedding is this afternoon! [completely drowned out by hip-hop] Have you seen Rarity? She's got to alter the sleeves on my suit, and she's got to do it now! Oh, ha-ha, thank goodness. Lead on, my friend.
509000 [bowling strike]
509061 Er, why have you brought me here? Rarity would never set hoof in—
509000 [suits sparkling]
509061 Great whickering stallions, they've got style! Gentlecolts! I'm facing certain calamity, and I couldn't help noticing your remarkable fashion sense. Could I have the name of your incredible tailor?
5092a5 Oh, yeah, man. His name is me.
509061 "Me". What an unfortunate name.
5092a5 No, man, like, I manufacture all of my own garments. We all do, man.
509061 Then you've got to help me! I need this suit tailored! It's an emergency!
5092a5 [laughs] Sorry, man, we're just about to start the finals.
509061 What's this word you keep using – "man"?
5092a5 I dunno, man, but guess what? Our fourth didn't show, so if you roll with us, we'll alter your suit for you.
509000 [scribbling noises]
509061 I'm sorry, gentlecolts, but I will not bowl. The splits, the spares! There are simply too many variables!
5092a5 Variables? What are you talking about, man? Just throw the ball straight!
509061 Hold on. Straight?
509000 [dinging]
509000 [bowling strike]
509061 Very well. I'll try your "straight" technique. It just might be crazy enough to work.
5092a6 Do we know what they're on about?
50900a The way they're huddled up like that, I'd say it's either a friendship problem or a monster attack.
5092a6 A monster attack?! Blast! I'm performing at the ceremony this afternoon, and I still haven't sorted out what to play. How am I meant to practice with a monster invading Ponyville?
509066 Maybe it's just a friendship problem, and it'll all be cleared up in half an hour or so.
5092a6 [groan] I hope so.
50915b Where's Pinkie Pie?! I need my wedding planner!
509000 [bugbear growling]
509000 [magic zap]
50915b Oh, no! On my wedding day?! Somepony's gotta help me! You!
509116 Me?
50915b I need to move an entire wedding from tomorrow to today!
509116 But nopony's asked me to organize anything since Twilight came to town.
50915b So you'll do it?
509116 I used to be the best organizer in all of Ponyville. You bet I'll—
509000 [bugbear growling]
50900c Whoa!
509000 [crash]
50915b Come on! We better get to the salon before that monster flattens it!
509000 [bugbear roaring]
509000 [bugbear growling]
50913d What am I gonna do? [gasp] Matilda! I feel so bad about the invitations! Is there anything I can do—
50915b FLOWERS!
50902e You want Matilda's arrangements... today?!
509000 [thud]
509022 This is awful!
50902f The horror, the horror!
50913d So there's no way you can do it?
50902e We don't even have Matilda's flowers in yet, much less arranged! [gasps] This is a disaster!
50913d Okay. Thanks anyway.
509000 [bugbear growling]
50902e [gasps] Look, girls! A broken stem on one of the zinnias!
509022 Whaaat?!
509000 [thud]
50902f Oh, the horror, the horror!
509027 I have to admit, when Matilda said we needed this place ready by today, I was a little nervous.
50919a With you by my side, I knew we'd get it done in time.
509027 There is nothing like a best friend, is there?
50919a Anything's possible when you know somepony as well as we know each other!
509000 [distant bugbear roaring]
509027 What was that?
50919a There's some monster attacking Ponyville or something.
509027 What is it this time? A creature from the Everfree Forest?
50919a Uh, I think it's some sort of bugbear. [giggles]
509027 Did you say bugbear? It found me!
50919a What are you talking about, Bon Bon?
509027 My name isn't Bon Bon. It's "Special Agent Sweetie Drops". I work for a super-secret anti-monster agency in Canterlot, or at least I did until the bugbear went missing from Tartarus a few years back.
50919a What are you talking about?
509027 When it escaped, we had to shutter the whole agency. Every last shred of evidence of the organization's existence was destroyed. Celestia demanded complete deniability.
50919a ...What?
509027 It was me who captured the bugbear. I had to go deep cover here in Ponyville and assume the name Bon Bon. I never thought it'd be able to track me, but now it has.
50919a Are you saying our whole friendship was based on a lie?!
509027 I'm sorry, Lyra! I couldn't tell you for your own protection!
50919a B-b-but the lunches! The-the long talks! The benches we sat on! [tearing up] None of that was real?!
509027 It was all real. You're my very best friend.
509000 [bugbear roaring]
509000 [window opening]
509000 [thud]
509027 I've got to go find a crowd to blend into before I put you in danger! I'll see you at the wedding.
50919a Fine! But we're going to talk about this later!
50915c I need my ring today, no matter the cost! ...As long as it doesn't cost any extra.
5092a5 Seven/ten split, man. Harshest of the harsh. But if you pick this up, we win the whole shebang!
509061 [inhales, exhales]
509000 [door opens]
50913d Doc! I've finally figured out how I can help! Your flameless fireworks look just like flowers! I'll use them for the wedding!
509061 Great whickering stallions! Wait!
509000 [pin clattering]
5092a7 [angry grunt]
509061 Wait! The flameless fireworks are extremely volatile! Without knowing what the trigger is, they could go off at any moment! My word, is that a bugbear?
509000 [bugbear growling]
50915b Oh, there are so many things I'm forgetting! I hope Cranky remembers to tell the musicians! Oh! Oh! I'll never get my mane done in time!
50904c You must relax, my dear! We can handle anything! We once did a pony's hair during the ceremony!
509016 Oh, it's true, it's true! They really are the best! Matilda, I've just got to say, I already feel like we're family.
50915b You do?
509016 Of course! I'm Steven Magnet, Cranky's best beast!
50915b You're Steven Magnet?
509016 Well, what'd you expect, a bugbear? I've known Cranky forev-er! Surely he must have told you about the time he saved me from Flash Freeze Lake?
50915b ...You're Steven Magnet.
509016 Oh, I know, I know! Typical Cranky, to leave out minor details, like the fact that I'm, y'know, a sea monster, right? [laughs] I just love that old burro!
50915b I'm sorry, Steven. I guess I assumed you were a pony. And I had no idea you had such adventures together.
509016 Oh, honey, you don't know the half of it! But let me tell you something. In all that we've been through together, the only thing he ever cared about was finding you.
50915b Really?
509016 Well, that and a baldness cure. [laughs]
50915b He is the sweetest thing, isn't he? All the stress I've put myself through. All the stress I've put him through. The only thing that matters is that we're together. The wedding isn't the important thing – the marriage is.
509016 [laughing] Oh, goodness gracious. If you believe that, I have got a bridge to sell you! All these ponies traveling to Ponyville, putting on uncomfortable clothes, sitting through a long ceremony, you think any of them care about the marriage? [laughing] Honey, the wedding is everything.
50915b [teeth rattling]
5092a6 [playing Mendelssohn's "Wedding March"] Ugh, all these wedding songs are so... standard. I want Matilda and Cranky's wedding to be special. [continues playing cello]
509000 [cello overlaid with dubstep beats]
5092a6 Thanks, but I'm not sure that's appropriate for a wedding, is it? [resumes playing]
509000 [dubstep cello]
5092a6 [gasps] That's more like it!
509000 [dubstep cello continues]
509000 [dubstep cello intensifies]
509000 [record scratch]
5092a6 Stop! I'm going to be late for the wedding!
509000 [dubstep cello continues]
509000 [bugbear growling]
509000 [magic zap]
509000 [dubstep cello continues]
509000 [thuds under]
509000 [dink!]
509000 [music stops abruptly]
5090c6 [narrating] What is life? Is it nothing more than the endless search for a cutie mark? And what is a cutie mark but a constant reminder that we're all only one bugbear attack away from oblivion? And what of the poor gator? Flank forever blank, destined to an existential swim down the river of life to... an unknowable destiny? [licks]
509000 [series of thuds]
5092a6 Something like that might work.
509019 [hushed] What do you mean you left it on the counter?!
50901a [hushed] I thought you were bringing it!
509019 [hushed] [groans] Well, this is just wonderful!
509000 [beat]
50901a [hushed] I handled the gift for Cadance and Shining Armor! You were supposed to do this one, remember?
509019 [hushed] Well, we can't just come to this wedding empty-hoofed!
509193 [sobbing]
509198 [sighs] It's alright. He always cries at weddings.
509193 [bawling]
509198 ...Usually it's not until the wedding starts.
50913d These flameless fireworks look even better than flowers! [giggles]
509027 Attention, everypony! Our friends have done it! They've defeated the bugbear!
509000 [ponies cheering]
509027 [to Lyra] Hey.
50919a Hello.
509027 So, uh, you didn't happen to mention our earlier conversation about my [hushed through gritted teeth] secret identity [normal] to anypony, did you?
50919a No. I did not. And you're not the only one with a secret, y'know. You know those expensive imported oats you were saving for a special occasion? I cooked them up and ate them! All of them! [laughs] It's sort of thrilling to reveal your deepest, darkest secrets!
509027 [laughs] That's what best friends are for.
509019 [hushed] Next time, you can just bring your own gift, and I'll bring mine.
50901a [hushed] Fine.
509000 [door creaks]
509061 There you are! My suit has vanished and this was the only thing left in my closet! How do I look?
50913d Like a million bits!
509061 Great whickering stallions, look at the time! We'd better get inside. Allons-y!
50915c I can't believe I lost my hair! I look ridiculous. The love of my life deserves better than this!
509016 Have no fear, Cranky, my dear. It's Steven Magnet's mustache to the rescue!
509000 [shing]
509000 [fsst]
50915c Aw, thanks, buddy.
509016 Oh, no problem. Now you get in there and marry that donkey!
509010 Well, is everypony here?
509000 [door slams, lock clicks]
50913d All set, Mayor!
509010 Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to join these two in mare-trimony. As I look around this room, I can only imagine how uncomfortable Cranky must be.
509000 [ponies laughing]
50915c [grumbles]
509010 But I also see so many ponies from all trots of life, brought together by love. Cranky searched all across this great land of ours to find Matilda, and no matter what obstacles kept them apart, love would finally bring them together, just as it has brought all of us together now. It's remarkable to me how a story like Cranky's search for Matilda could fill this room with such a unique collection of ponies! It makes you realize that everypony is the star of their own story. And it's not just the main characters in our stories that make life so rich! It's everypony – those who play big parts and those who play small. If it weren't for everypony in this room and many more who couldn't be here today, Cranky and Matilda's lives wouldn't be as full and vibrant as they are.
509016 [crying]
50917b [squeaks]
509010 And so, in front of all these loved ones... Cranky, do you take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded wife?
50915c You bet I do!
509010 And do you, Matilda, take this donkey to be your lawfully wedded husband?
50915b [tearing up] I do!
509010 Then I'm proud to say, I now pronounce you jack and jenny!
50915d [kissing]
509000 [ponies cheering]
509000 [flameless fireworks exploding]
509061 [laughs] Of course! They need love to ignite! How could I have missed it?!
509003 You know something, girls? We are so lucky to live in this town. I love you all!
50900c Ow! That's where the bugbear bit me!
509003 Sorry!
509000 [credits]
510000 [indistinct chatter]
510000 [fanfare]
51001a Welcome to the Grand Equestria Pony Summit!
510000 [crowd cheering]
510019 You delegates have traveled far and wide to represent your cities as we seek to celebrate and learn from all the unique places that make up our wonderful land of Equestria. At tonight's welcome reception, Princess Cadance will dedicate this beautiful friendship statue made up of gemstones from each of your home cities.
510000 [crowd oohing and ahhing]
510005 [licks lips]
510019 Now I'd like to turn things over to the one who organized the summit - Princess Twilight Sparkle!
510000 [crowd cheering]
510003 [tired] Thank you, everypony. With delegates from over fifty cities attending three days of conferences, receptions, and meetings, this is the largest Grand Equestria Pony Summit yet. And let me tell you, putting it all together has led to more than one sleepless night. We're so excited to have you here and to learn more about life all across this great land of ours.
510000 [crowd cheering]
510003 And now my faithful assistant Spike would like to say a few words.
510005 Um, hello, everypony! I'm here to help any way I can. So if there's anything I can do for any of you—
5102a8 We love you, Princess Twilight!
5102a9 We love all the princesses!
510000 [crowd cheering]
510005 [sighs] I guess everypony loves a princess. Hmph.
510000 [theme song]
510000 [knocking]
510000 [door slamming]
510005 Ugh!
510198 Spike!
510000 [thud]
510198 Spike?
510005 [muffled] A little help?
510198 Spike, we need you!
510005 Of course! What can I do?
510000 [door opens]
510005 Whoa, what happened to you?
510003 [groans] I'm sorry, Spike. I just... [yawns] ...need a quick... nap. Napkin! Tell the delegates I'll...
510198 She's been awake three straight days preparing for the summit. We need to make sure she gets some rest today. She'll never be able to attend the welcome reception in this condition. Can I count on you to see to it that she isn't disturbed?
510005 I promise! I won't let you down!
510003 [snoring]
510005 Perfect.
510000 [bird singing]
510005 Not on my watch.
510000 [bird singing]
510005 Uh, excuse me? Can you keep it down a little? Oh, no!
510000 [door opens]
510000 [bird singing]
510003 [snoring]
510005 I'll give you birdseed! Worms! Anything! Just please stop singing before you wake the princess!
510003 [snoring]
510005 Huh. I can't believe that worked.
510000 [polo ponies shouting]
510003 [groaning]
510005 Hyah!
5102aa [surprised noises]
510005 [sighs] Uh, hi fellas. Sorry to break up your game, but there's sort of an important diplomatic summit kind of thingy going on, and it involves a princess needing to sleep, and, uh... maybe you could move your game somewhere else?
510000 [chainsaw buzzing]
510005 Uh, the princess thanks you for your understanding! Excuse me. Do you have to do this right now? [sneezes] Oh, no! Are those dragon-sneeze trees? [sniffles]
5102ab Uh, these are too top-heavy. Wouldn't take much to bring these beauties down.
510000 [trees creaking]
510005 Can't you just wait a few hours?
5102ab Sorry, it's a public hazard. I got my orders.
510005 Well, I've got my orders too from Princess Twi... Twi... Twilight...! [sneezes]
5102ab Princess Twilight? [laughs] Why didn't you say so? Gee, I reckon they'll keep a few more hours.
510005 Huh. Good thing I've got the princesses on my side.
510000 [jackhammer rattling]
510005 [vibrating yelps] Aw, come on! Excuse me? [shouting] Excuse me, sir! I really need you to— [jackhammer stops] —stop right now! Oops.
5102ac [loudly] Lemme guess, the noise? Sorry, but we can't have a broken water main!
510005 Ugh, you couldn't do this yesterday?!
5102ac [loudly] Hey, pal, I'm just tryin' to make sure everything runs smooth for the summit!
510005 But there is no summit without Princess Twilight, and she needs things to be kept quiet around here. So if you don't mind, I'd—
5102ac [loudly] All right, all right, if that's how she wants it! [beat] [quickly] But if something happens, it ain't my fault!
510005 Hmph! Princess Twilight will be rested, Princess Cadance will be proud, and Princess Spike deserves a little reward. Hah! Princess Spike. [laughs] [licks lips]
5102ad [arguing]
5102ae ...Oh, lemme tell you somethin', alright? I worked forever on this speech, and I know I have more—
510005 Uh, hi. Can I help you?
5102af My friend here, the distinguished pony from up Manehattan, and I are in a bit of a pickle, and we need the Princess Twilight to resolve it.
510005 Uh, can you talk a little quieter? And maybe come back later?
5102af Oh, sure now, gosh, I wish we could but, uh, we're both supposed to give speeches about our local economies in five minutes, and we've been booked in the same hall!
5102ae I had the room first. And let's be honest, my speech is more important.
5102af Point of order there, sir, but I think you'll find that my speech is the more important one, don't'cha know?
5102ae Look, youse is gonna have a lot of unhappy delegates on your hooves unless we get a ruling from Princess Twilight right now!
510005 [sighs] Lemme see what I can do.
510000 [door opens]
510003 [snoring] Huh?
510005 [squeals]
510003 Does something need scheduling?
510005 Oh, uh, yeah. Two delegates have speeches booked in the same hall. What do I do?
510003 Okay, no problem. Just put the hay in the apple and eat the candle, hm?
510005 Huh?
510003 [yawns]
510000 [thud]
510005 Oh, I need an answer, but Twilight can't even think straight! Oh, my gosh, what am I supposed to do?!
510000 [door opens and shuts]
5102ae Well? What did she say? She picked me, right?
5102af Hey, hey, hey. Let's not be too hasty there, good sir. I got a feeling she went with me.
5102ae He-hey, if she didn't pick me, it ain't hard to see that as an insult to all of Manehattan! You know what I'm sayin'?
5102af And it'd sure be a shame to see something like a scheduling issue create a nasty old rift between Whinnyapolis and Ponyville.
5102ae So? What did the Princess say?
5102af Come on, now! Spit it out!
510005 Um, she said that... Well, she said that she... she wants you to... share it?
510000 [beat]
5102ae If that's what the princess wants, what are ya gonna do?
5102af The princess is always right!
5102ae Joe Pescolt:
5102ae Listen. No hard feelings.
5102ae This is not about you or me, alright?
5102ae I mean, this is...
5102af March Gustysnows:
5102af Now there ya go,
5102af we got a solution!
5102af I have no hard feelings...
510005 [sighs] Now, back to more important things! [chews]
5102b0 Combining those two talks was a disaster! The hall was overcrowded and the speakers just shouted over each other!
510005 Huh? B-but—
5102b0 Why would the princess have made such a decision?!
510000 [other annoyed delegates chattering]
510005 Uh, by order of Princess Twilight, be quiet! [echoes out]
5102b1 I was really looking forward to the "Don't Spend All Your Bits" Speech, but when I went into the hall, [tearing up] a pony had taken my seat. A pony who used to be my friend!
510005 Your friend took your seat? Hah, big deal! Why don't you just—
5102b1 No offense, but I don't need some random dragon's opinion. I-I want to hear what Princess Twilight thinks.
510005 [sighs] Fine.
510000 [door opens and shuts]
510003 [snoring]
510000 [door opens]
510005 Uh...
510000 [door shuts]
510005 The princess says no friendship should end over a seat. You should forgive your friend!
5102b1 [gasps] Of course! Oh, the princess is so wise!
510000 [delegates chattering]
510005 I could tell these delegates anything as long as they think it came from Twilight. [beat] Alright! Who's next?
510000 [musical sequence]
510005 So, how can Princess Twilight be of service?
510122 Well, as host city, the Canterlot delegation feels it's only right that we should get passes to every meeting and party, yes?
510005 Well, that doesn't seem fair—I mean, Princess Twilight doesn't think that seems fair.
510122 Ehhh... yes, yes, very well. It was worth a try though, wasn't it, old chap, hm?
510005 This is great! I just took care of a whole bunch of stuff that Twilight won't have to worry about when she wakes up! Wonder if anypony else needs the princess's help?
510000 [door opens]
510000 [paper rustling]
510005 If I can check a few of these meetings off Twilight's schedule, then when she wakes up, she won't have to think about anything but the reception.
510000 [background ponies chattering]
510005 Uh, it says here you have a meeting with Princess Twilight?
5102b2 [lisping] Uh, yuppers. She wanted me to prep her on all the different gemstones in the Citizens of Equestria statue before the reception tonight.
510005 Okay, go ahead.
5102b2 [lisping] Um, well, I'd rather, um, tell the princess directly.
510005 Well, if it helps, you can call me "Princess Spike". No-no-no, it's alright. The princess asked me to take care of a few things for her. That's why I came to find you.
5102b2 [lisping] Um, if you say so.
510005 The princess says so!
5102b2 [lisping] Uh, okay. Let's start with topaz...
5102ac [bites apple]
510005 I'm here for your two o'clock!
5102ac You?! But I'm supposed to be briefing Princess Twilight on the progress with the water main!
510005 I speak for the Princess.
5102ac Uh, well, uh, can I start fixing it again? I'm getting a little worried, to be honest.
510000 [pipe groaning]
510005 Actually, Twilight still needs her rest, and her no-noise policy is still in effect for a few more hours. Sorry.
510198 Hey, Spike. What's going on?
510005 Oh, you know, just settin' 'em up and knockin' 'em down!
510198 What do you mean?
510005 Not only have I kept things quiet so Twilight could sleep, I also took care of all her afternoon meetings so she won't have to worry about them when she wakes up.
510198 Are you sure she'd want you doing that? There are so many things to keep track of at this summit.
510005 Nah, don't worry. I got it covered. I know Twilight so well, it's easy to make decisions like her!
510198 Oh, okay. Well, thank you for keeping Twilight's stress level down. As long as that's the real reason you're doing it.
510005 Well, why else would I be doing it?
510198 You're not enjoying speaking for Twilight a little bit?
510005 Enjoying it? [laughs] No way! The only things I'm doing by order of the princess are for the good of the summit! [laughs]
510005 [sighs] [vibrating] By order of the princess.
510000 [steam hissing]
510005 By order of the princess! [chews]
510005 [through gritted teeth] By order of the princess...!
510005 [sighs] Princess life is good! [chews]
510198 It sure is, but it's also hard work, isn't it?
510005 Eh, it's not so bad.
510198 Spike, I'm concerned you might be abusing your relationship with Twilight.
510005 What are you talking about? I'm a great princess—I mean, Twilight's a great princess! And I've been working hard to help her! When two delegates had a falling out, I'm the one who fixed their friendship! I listened to that pony drone on about gems for forty-five minutes so Twilight wouldn't have to! I moved a polo match away from the tower so she could sleep! And I didn't even eat that delicious looking statue! I'm a decision-making master!
510000 [beat]
510005 [sighs] Okay. So maybe I did get a little carried away making decisions. But it's not like anything bad happened.
510000 [thok]
510000 [trees falling]
510000 [water main bursting]
5102b3 [screaming]
510005 This is unexpected!
510198 I'll go shut off the main! You get rid of the water!
510000 [splashing]
510000 [crystals growing]
510000 [door groaning]
510000 [splash]
510005 At least the statue's okay. [sniffles] Oh. Oh, no. Oh, no! [sneezes]
510000 [gems tinkling]
510005 Oh, bless me...
510000 [delegates shouting]
510122 Oh, my! What is the meaning of this?!
510005 Well, uh, you see, there was this polo game, and—
510122 How could you let a water main burst on Canterlot's most important day?!
5102ac Hey, don't look at me! Princess Twilight said to stop working on it!
510122 Well, what about these trees?! I ordered them trimmed to avoid just such a situation!
5102ab But the princess told me to stop, bub!
510122 Why would the princess make such horrible decisions?! This all could have been prevented!
510000 [delegates shouting]
510005 Please, everypony, listen! I'm so sorry all this happened!
510122 What are you apologizing for? These were Princess Twilight's awful decisions!
5102af I'm about to blow my stack on Princess Twilight, I'll tell you that for nothin'!
5102ae Yeah, me too!
510122 I'll not let Princess Twilight give Canterlot a bad name in the eyes of Equestria! Come on, everypony! Let's go give her a piece of our minds!
510000 [delegates shouting]
510005 Please! You've got it all wrong!
510000 [delegates shouting]
510005 [panting] Wait! I mean, [hushed] wait!
510122 What is it now?! There's an angry mob here that demands satisfaction!
510005 It's just that, uh, we don't want to wake the princess, do we?
5102ae Wake her?! What?! You're tellin' me that she's asleep?!
510000 [delegates shouting]
510000 [door opens and shuts]
510000 [lock clicks]
510005 [panting]
510122 [muffled] Princess, we must speak at once!
510005 She is SLEEPING!
510003 [snoring]
510005 [sighs]
510003 [yawns] I'm glad you're here, Spike. We've got a lot to do! Do you know if the water main was fixed?
510005 Uh, you seem well-rested.
510003 I haven't slept like that since I was a filly!
510005 You haven't? Well, at least I got one thing right. And it was the one thing Cadance asked of me. Maybe I did do a good job today!
510000 [knocking]
510000 [doors burst open]
510005 [yelps]
510000 [delegates shouting]
510003 Fancy Pants, what's wrong?
510122 Don't play games with me, Princess! You know why I'm here!
510003 Is this about the special privileges you wanted? Because this seems a little extreme!
510122 The special privileges?! The last thing on my mind is special privileges!
510003 What's going on, Spike?
510005 Um... you needed to sleep. And Princess Cadance told me you weren't to be disturbed. And there was this bird, and, well... long story short, I made a few decisions on your behalf.
510003 A few decisions?!
510005 Well, maybe more than a few, but I had good intentions! Honest! Until I... didn't anymore. I'm sorry, Twilight. I guess I got a little carried away. It-it just felt so good to have ponies caring about my opinions on such important matters. I guess I was just enjoying feeling like a princess.
510003 Well, Spike, one of the most important things a princess can do is realize when she's made a mistake and fix it.
510005 How do I do that?
510198 You could start with them.
510005 [sighs] Uh, hi there, everypony. So I guess I owe you all a pretty big apology. It's funny. Here we are at a summit that brings together ponies from all across Equestria, and all I could think about was myself. You all came here to celebrate the things that make each of our cities so unique and special. But instead of getting into the spirit of things like all of you, I used my friend's position to make myself feel good.
510000 [gems clinking]
510122 The Canterlot ruby goes here, old sport.
5102af And ours goes here, don't'cha know?
510000 [delegates chattering, gems clinking]
510005 Does this mean you forgive me?
5102ae Sure! You know, the whole idea of the statue is that when each of us plays our own small part, it adds up to somethin' great.
510122 Quite. Just like how all our cities make up the beautiful land of Equestria!
510198 I hereby dedicate the Citizens of Equestria statue to everypony who plays their part, no matter how big or how small!
510000 [delegates cheering]
510005 [sniffles] Aw, come on! [inhales for a sneeze]
510000 [credits]
511003 You look nervous. There's no reason to be nervous. Nothing to worry about. Everything's gonna be fine!
511007 Twilight, tell those butterflies in your tummy to beat it! Making new friends is always fun.
511003 Ohhhh...
51100e They're probably just as nervous as you are.
511008 You've been plannin' this shindig for weeks. You know everything about these fellers. It's gonna be dandy.
511003 [inhales] [exhales] You're right. Remember, Equestria and Yakyakistan haven't opened their borders for hundreds of moons. In fact, Yakyakistan is so far north of the Crystal Mountains, nopony's even been there! Imagine the look on Princess Celestia's face when she finds out we made friends with a yak prince! [nervous laugh] I'm calm! I'm calm...
511005 [blows trumpet]
511000 [carpet unfurling]
5112b4 Ponies! Greetings, ponies!
511000 [teleporting zap]
511003 Prince Rutherford, your Majesty. On behalf of all of us, I welcome you to Equestria.
5112b4 Me honored. Yaks hope for great friendship between ponies and yaks. [echoing] Friends for a thousand moons!
511003 You must be hungry after a long journey.
511000 [table scraping]
511003 We've prepared a banquet of traditional yak foods.
5112b4 If things not perfect, yaks get mad. Yaks always get mad when things not perfect!
511003 [gulp]
5112b4 [sniffs] [chewing] [spits] This no taste like yak food! Fake pony food make yaks mad!
5112b5 [roaring]
511000 [assorted noises of destruction]
511007 Is it okay to be nervous now?
511000 [theme song]
511000 [walls cracking]
511008 Them yaks sure have a funny way of sayin' "howdy."
51100d They're different, that's all. Very... different.
51100c I think they broke my record for most stuff broken in under a minute. I mean, they even broke the trophy.
511003 All we have to do is show them how great it can be to have friends before Princess Celestia arrives for the friendship party tonight. Now, who read the seven-volume cross-indexed history of Yakyakistan I recommended?
51100c Um... I-I had a thing...
511007 I did, I did! Did you know they live so far north of the Crystal Empire that it's cold all the time? Yaks have yak fur to keep them warm. [squee]
511008 Pretty sure that's what fur's always for, Pinkie Pie.
511007 I know! Yaks are so cool!
511000 [vase smashing]
511003 Pinkie Pie, can you show them around town? I know you have to plan the friendship party too, but it would really help make them feel welcome.
511007 Don't worry. They'll be in good hooves with me.
511003 Remember, we want to make sure Equestria feels like home. That means doing everything we can to make this place feel like Yakyakistan.
511007 No problem!
511003 Good. Let's get out there and make some new friends!
51101f [cries of agreement]
511008 We know y'all are noble warriors who avoid the so-called finer things, so me and my family would be honored if you rested here in the barn during your visit.
511007 Applejack and I made hay beds like you're used to back in Yakyakistan.
5112b4 Hmm... This perfect.
511007 You can snooze here all afternoon, 'cause you're gonna need a lot of energy for my party tonight!
511008 [sighs] That wasn't so hard.
5112b4 Wait! This not yak hay!
511007 Well, we didn't have actual hay from Yakyakistan, but we tried our best to make it just like yours.
5112b4 Not perfect! Yaks destroy!
5112b5 [roaring and grunting]
511008 Pinkie Pie, what do we do?!
511007 And now, for your entertainment pleasure... Presenting animals, Yakyakistan style!
511000 [animals chittering]
5112b4 Animals cute.
51100e Oh. Thank goodness.
511000 [thud]
5112b4 Wait. These antlers lie! These not Yakyakistani animals! Yaks smash!
5112b5 [roaring and grunting]
511000 [teaware shattering]
511007 Okay, well... There's still other things we can do. I think.
51100d Yes! These are some of my favorite materials. Very rare, imported from the Crystal Empire to match your northern sensibilities. I hope you'll find them—
5112b5 [chewing]
51100d ...delicious.
5112b5 [spits]
5112b4 This no taste like yak fabric! Yaks destroy!
5112b5 [roaring and grunting]
511007 Everything's gonna be fine. You'll just... make it up to them. Somehow.
511000 [birds tweeting]
511007 Listen up! Tell your faces to hold onto their frowns, 'cause they're about to get turned upside-down!
5112b4 Hold your frown, face!
511007 Hit it, Rainbow Dash!
511000 [snow booming]
511007 Just like Yakyakistan snow, right? Because snow is snow, no matter where it comes from.
5112b4 [slurp] This not yak snow!
5112b5 [roaring and grunting]
511007 Seriously?! ...Seriously?
511008 Y'know... it's goin' okay.
51100d Satisfactory, I'd say.
51100c It could be better.
51100e [whispering] It's not very good.
511007 It's a disaster!
511003 Pinkie Pie, tonight's Yakyakistan theme party is more important than ever! You'll make them forget all about this afternoon, right? Because if it's not perfect, they're gonna smash everything! And I'm not sure how much more smashing this visit can take!
511007 I definitely will! I think. Maybe...?
511008 You're the best gosh-darn party planner in Equestria.
51100c You'll show 'em a good time!
51100e You can do it!
51100d We have absolute confidence in your abilities, Pinkie Pie.
511007 It's going to be my most happy-tacular party ever! I hope!
51100c Why are your eyes darting around like that?
511007 It's what I do when I'm not nervous! [laughing hysterically]
511003 Pinkie Pie, I don't know what we'd do without you—
511007 Me either! Gotta go!
511000 [hoofsteps trailing off]
511007 [hyperventilating] Gummy, what am I gonna do? I had all this amazing stuff planned for the party, but they're gonna hate it! There's no way to make Equestria feel like Yakyakistan. They're just too sensitive! Even Fluttershy made them mad! Fluttershy! Oh... I need a new idea, and I need it now. How am I supposed to make this party feel like Yakyakistan without actually going there and bringing something back?!
5110c6 [slurps]
511007 [gasps] Gummy, you're a genius. [kisses]
511003 And this is Sugarcube Corner. They're working hard to make your traditional Yakyakistan cake.
5112b4 Vanilla extract balance very tricky.
5112b6 Uh-huh.
511003 Do you mind, um, waiting here for one moment?
511000 [teleporting zap]
511003 How's tonight's party coming? I'm doing what I can, but it's really up to you at this point! ...Pinkie? Where are you?!
511003 [teeth chattering] Did you find her?
51100e Angel and I searched the forest, but...
51100c Aerial recon turned up nothing either.
511008 I searched the farm inside and out. No Pinkie Pie. But I did find a set of Granny Smith's dentures under the house, so... not a complete loss.
51100d She's simply vanished!
511003 But the party! It's all we have left! What are we gonna do?!
511000 [whack]
5110c6 [barfs]
511003 [reading] "Don't worry. I'll be back in time for the party. Love, Pinkie Pie." If Pinkie Pie says she'll be back in time for the party, she'll be back. We have to trust her. Right? [nervous laugh] No reason to freak out!
51100e Don't worry, Twilight.
511008 When it comes to parties, I think she knows what she's doin'.
511003 [inhales] [exhales] You're right. Let's just focus on keeping the yaks happy 'til she's back.
51100c Piece o' cake.
511003 The cake!
51102a One bite, and you'll be transported right back to Yakyakistan. [nervous laugh] I hope.
511000 [teleporting zap]
5112b4 [chewing] Hmm... Ponies too heavy on vanilla extract!
5112b5 [roaring and grunting]
511003 We've never needed a party so badly.
51113e Next stop, Crystal Empire!
511007 And so my quest begins. I know what you're thinking. "Why go to Yakyakistan alone, Pinkie Pie?" Because I'm the party planner. This burden falls on my rump and my rump alone. If I want a great party, I gotta climb the mountains north of the Crystal Empire, find Yakyakistan, and come back with something authentic! Know what I mean?
511000 [brakes screeching and hissing]
511007 Did we go the wrong way? Where's all the snow? Please tell me this is magical sand-colored snow. [spits] Nope. Sand. Definitely sand.
51113e Dodge City. End of the line, I'm afraid. All trains had to stop. Sheep decided to sit on the tracks.
511000 [sheep baaing]
511007 Curse you, sheep! Thanks for you help, conductor.
511000 [smack]
511007 Cherry Jubilee!
511141 Pinkie Pie?! I reckoned I eyeballed you crossin' my way right now.
511007 How are you? You look amazing! I need help.
511141 I'm dandy as a daffodil and fit as a floribunda. What can I do ya for?
511007 Have you heard of Yakyakistan? Do you have any idea how I can get there?
511141 Mark your calendar, missy, 'cause this right here's your lucky day! I'm headin' north to the Crystal Empire myself for a delivery. I ought to warn you though – me and the boys are powerful tired 'cause we was up all night countin' cherries. Hey there! Wake up!
511007 Counting cherries? How many?
511141 Four hundred and seventeen thousand, two hundred and thirty-four. Yee-haw!
511007 Whoa!
511007 And so my quest resumes. As I stare across the endless desert, I tell myself I will soon triumphantly enter the homeland of our noble guests and return with a prize to make the best party they've ever seen. Know what I mean?
511141 [snoring]
511007 Cherry? Ravine. Ravine!
511000 [alarm clock ringing]
511000 [water splashing]
511007 Wake up! Wake up! [grunting] Stooooop!
511000 [screeching]
511000 [thuds]
511141 Huh?! [gasps] Whoa. I was dreamin' about a ravine. Ravine!
511007 That's what I said.
511000 [rock cracks, snaps]
511000 [piano playing]
5112b5 [sobbing]
5112b4 Music beautiful. Much soul.
511003 Phew!
511005 [sighs] When Twilight told me to stall— I-I mean, entertain you, I thought there's no way I could—
511000 [piano continues playing]
5112b6 Huh?
511003 Spike!
5112b4 Piano play itself?! Music a lie! [roars]
511000 [piano smashing]
5112b4 We demand party! Party now or yaks no friends!
511003 No! Just a little longer!
5112b4 No more longer! We leave now! Yak go to train, return with more yaks! We declare war!
511049 [gasps]
511003 No Pinkie Pie? What's this?!
511008 Heh-heh. We panicked and tried to plan our own party.
51100c It's sort of panic-themed.
511003 The yaks are going home! This is awful! I wanted to surprise Princess Celestia. Now the only surprise is that I may have just started a war.
511000 [wind blowing]
511007 There we were, face-to-face with Falling Pony Ravine. Down, down, down! And then, suddenly... Pow! We were rescued mid-air by the Wonderbolts! And then they gave me a ride to Manehattan, I joined a traveling band, we played some shows here and there, got popular, almost made it big until creative differences tore us apart. And that's when I knew I had to get back on with my journey to the Crystal Empire, the gateway to Yakyakistan! And so here I am. It was a major adventure that took most of the afternoon. Know what I mean?
511198 This is it. The northern boundary of the Crystal Empire. Beyond lies Yakyakistan. Nopony who's attempted this climb has ever returned. Are you sure you have to do this?
511007 I do.
511198 Good luck, Pinkie Pie.
511003 How could she be so late to the party? This isn't like her.
51100e I'm sure she's trying her best.
51100c Pinkie Pie's tougher than she looks.
511003 I know you're right, but... I wish she was here. I put too much pressure on her. I let everypony down. And Princess Celestia will be here any minute and see that I haven't made new friends. I've made new enemies. [sighs]
511000 [gears clicking]
5112b7 [screaming]
511000 [snow shuffling]
511000 [creature roaring]
511007 Hi! My name is Pinkie Pie! I'm looking for Yakyakistan. You know, faraway land, lots of yaks? Maybe you've heard of it?
5112b8 [roaring]
511007 Whoa-ho-ho! Slow down! I can't understand a word you're saying—
5112b8 [growling]
511007 [yelps] There it is! Yakyakistan!
511000 [sledding]
511000 [gate opens]
511000 [snow cracks, breaks]
511007 Noooooooooo...! [fades in and out]
511003 Ugh. Is everypony alright?
51100e I can't tell if my eyes are open or closed.
51100c I think I can see a little bit.
511000 [crash]
51100c Gah! Nope.
511000 [light flickers on]
5112b7 Ooooh...
511008 Look at these! Pinkie Pie's made files for everypony in town!
51100e With exactly what kind of parties we like.
51100c Pinkie Pie has a secret party-planning cave?! How cool is this?!
51100e [reading] "Twilight Sparkle likes vanilla ice cream, red balloons, dancing..."
511003 That's right!
51100e "But she's afraid of quesadillas."
511003 No, I'm not! They're just so... [shudders] cheesy.
511007 [fading in] ...oooooooo! No! I'm all the way back where I started! Gummy, I was this close to helping Twilight befriend the yaks. Now I've just let everypony down.
511000 [muffled chatter]
511007 Hmm?
5112b7 [talking over each other]
511008 Looky here. It's notes for the party she wants to throw for her folks' fiftieth anniversary. But they ain't nearly that old! Huh. She's already plannin' their one-hundredth too. And their five-hundredth?
511003 I had no idea she worked so hard on her parties.
51100c She may be more organized than you, Twilight.
511003 Let's not get carried away.
51100d I just wish Pinkie Pie were here so we could tell her how much we all appreciate her hard work.
511007 [tearing up] Thank you! Thank you! I love you too! All of you!
511003 You're back!
511007 I tried to go to Yakyakistan so I could bring something back for my party. But at the last second, I made a mistake. [sighs] I worked harder on this party than any party ever. But I'm still just a big failure.
511003 Pinkie Pie, you're not a failure.
51100e What matters is how hard you tried.
51100c Who else would've gone all across Equestria to plan one party?
511007 You know... the trip was really hard. But everypony I met along the way was so helpful. I just wish the yaks could see how friendly and wonderful and great Equestria really is! [gasps] I just got the best party idea ever!
511003 It's too late. The yaks left on the last train.
511007 Um, no, they didn't. [squeals] Trust me! There are a whole lot of sheep out there!
511000 [sloop]
51100e So, um, do we walk back up the slide, or... or what?
5112b4 Yaks stuck here?! Why trains not work?! [growling]
511007 I never thought I'd say this, but... thank you, sheep! And now, if it's okay with you, it's party time!
5112b6 Ooh.
511000 [ponies chattering]
5112b4 [laughing]
511003 Wow, Pinkie. This came together quick, even for you.
511007 What can I say? I'm good at what I do. Prince Rutherford, every time we tried to make something in Equestria feel like Yakyakistan, we couldn't get it right. When I got back from my adventure, I realized something. We shouldn't try to make Equestria feel like your home. We should try to make you feel at home in Equestria. And that means showing you why we love it here, so you'll love it too.
5112b4 Pink pony work hard to make yaks feel at home. Now yaks happy. No declare war.
511003 [sighs]
5112b4 Ponies and yaks... friends?
511007 For a thousand moons?
5112b4 For a thousand moons!
5112b9 [cheering]
511019 I am very impressed, princess.
511003 Heh. Just doing my best to spread friendship.
511019 And you did a wonderful job of it. You and your friends.
5112b4 Pink pony, you understand yaks now.
511007 Aww, come here, you!
511000 [beat]
511007 [strained] Wow! Too strong! Okay, okay, okay!
511000 [credits]
512000 [dishes clinking]
512005 [sighs] You know the worst thing about you being the Princess of Friendship? The dishes.
512003 Thanks for taking care of that, Spike. After three events in one week, I really needed to relax with a good book.
512005 It's kinda funny, isn't it? All these ponies comin' to you for advice about friendship?
512003 What's funny about that?
512005 You know, 'cause you used to be famous for being such a bad friend.
512003 What are you talking about? I had good friends in Canterlot.
512005 Come on, Twilight. Look at the wall. D'ya see any photos from before we moved to Ponyville? And look at you now – the Princess of Friendship.
512003 [gasps] This is a disaster! All my old friends! I can't remember any of their names right now! But do you really think that they think I'm a bad friend?!
512005 Well, I only meant that you've come so far. You're a great friend now and—
512003 Oh, I feel terrible! I've gotta make it up to them! Pack a bag, Spike! We're going to Canterlot! And make a list of my friends' names.
512005 Aw. Me and my big mouth.
512000 [theme song]
512005 Come on, Twilight. You're getting worked up about nothin'.
512003 The only logical place to start is at the beginning.
512000 [doors open]
512003 Oh. It's exactly how we left it! [blows] Look! It's Predictions and Prophecies! And it's still open to the Elements of Harmony!
512005 And here's that present I was gonna give Moon Dancer! Huh. Guess she won't be needing that. Hey, look! The rest of it's still here!
512003 How could I have let this happen?
512005 Come on, Twilight. Princess Celestia gave you an assignment. Nopony could blame you for that.
512003 But look at the way I left this place. It's a total mess! Just like how I left my friendships.
512000 [window squeaks]
512003 I've gotta make it up toooo... uh...
512005 Oh! Uh, Minuette, Twinkleshine, Lemon Hearts, Lyra Heartstrings, and Moon Dancer.
512003 Yeah. Them.
512005 [snoring]
512003 Spike! Come on! We've got work to do!
512005 [groans] Have you been awake all night?
512003 I did a little research, and I think I know where we can find Minuette! That is one of my friends, right?
512000 [knock on door]
512005 Uh, it's not too late to forget I opened my big mouth.
512003 No, Spike, I'm glad you opened your big mouth. These ponies have probably been suffering ever since I left. Wondering why their supposed friend would treat them so badly!
512000 [door opens]
512003 Minuette?
512199 Twilight Sparkle! [laughs] You old so-and-so! What are you doing here?! Hey, Spike! Look at these wings, huh?! [giggles] Hey, grab a picture of me and the princess, will ya?! I tried to tell my co-workers we used to be friends back when. [giggles] But they've never believed me!
512000 [lens focusing]
512199 Wait-wait-wait! Really fluff 'em up, huh? [giggles]
512000 [flash developing]
512000 [snap]
512199 So what are you doing here? I mean, I know you're here all the time, but you never come to see me. Hey! I just had the greatest idea! You wanna go see Lemon Hearts and Twinkleshine?
512003 Of course! My old friends!
512199 It'll be great! [giggles] Come on! Let's fly! Get it? [laughs]
512003 This is perfect! I can apologize to all three of them at once!
512005 Let's hope they're not as traumatized as Minuette.
5122ba [giggling]
512199 She did! Twinkleshine literally spit out her oats when she heard you were the Princess of Friendship!
512004 We saw you at the coronation. That was some shindig!
512003 You did?
512004 Sure! We see you all the time!
512199 You remember our old friend, Lyra, right? [giggles] She lives in Ponyville too. We're always over there visiting her. Or she's coming over here! [giggles] We've thought about asking you to join us from time to time, but we just sorta figured you'd moved on.
512003 Oh.
512000 [beat]
512098 [clears throat] So what brings you by anyway? All those times you've come back to Canterlot, you never had donuts with us before.
512003 Well, uh, you see... [sighs] I came to apologize.
512199 [gulps] For what?
512003 Before I left Canterlot, I didn't really appreciate my friends. And that's because I didn't know how important friendship was. But I've learned so much since I moved to Ponyville. I learned what it means to be a good friend and that I certainly wasn't one to the three of you. So for all the pain I caused you, I am truly sorry.
5122bb [giggling]
512199 Oh, come on, Twilight! Sure, it might've stung a little bit when you ran off to Ponyville without saying goodbye, but it's not like we weren't used to that from you!
512004 Yeah, we didn't take it personally.
512098 But it's really good to see you now. Hey! Anypony up for a blast from the past?
512003 [gasps] It's our old science lab! I have so many great memories of this place!
512199 [giggles] Remember when Lemon Hearts got her head stuck in that beaker?
5122bc [giggling]
512000 [fillies giggling]
5120ba But according to this book, you're supposed to add the sodium chloride first.
5122bd I read ahead, and to make a proper salt lick, you need to add the molasses first.
5120ba Well, I read ahead too, Moon Dancer, and I'm sure it said sodium chloride first.
5122bd [dryly] Oh. I've got the wrong book. That's so hilarious.
5122bb [giggling]
512003 Whatever happened to Moon Dancer?
512098 Moon Dancer?
512003 Yeah, you know, our other friend.
512004 Oh, right! Moon Dancer! I remember her!
512098 I wonder what she's up to.
512199 Yeah, I always liked her. We just sort of lost touch after you left.
512004 I think she went to live out by the stadium, didn't she?
512098 Well, let's go see.
512199 I think this is the place. Didn't used to look like this, though.
512003 [knocks on door]
512000 [door breaks]
512003 [gasps]
512000 [door creaks]
512003 Moon Dancer?
5122be What do you want? I'm trying to study.
512003 It's us! Your old friends!
5122be Ugh!
512000 [door slams]
512199 [nervous chuckle] That's old Moon Dancer, all right. She always did like her books. Hey! Kinda like you used to be, huh? [giggles]
512003 Exactly how I used to be.
512005 [sighs] Come on, Twilight! We've been watching her for three days! Library, house, library, house. That's it!
512003 Nopony looks at her or says hello or even gives her a smile. It's like she doesn't even exist. Was she always like this?
512199 Well, she always was a little shy. But for a while there, she was really starting to come out of her shell. Remember when she threw that party? Oh, right. I think you might've been busy that day.
512004 [flashback] There you are, Twilight! Moon Dancer is having a little get-together in the west castle courtyard. You wanna come?
512003 [flashback] Oh, sorry, girls... I've got a lot of studying to catch up on.
512199 Thought she finally might be letting her guard down a little with that party. We invited her out a few times after that. But she was always too busy studying. So, eventually, we just stopped asking.
512003 I had no idea that party was so important to her. I've gotta find a way to make it up to her!
512000 [door opens]
512000 [door closes]
512000 [quill writing]
512003 [gasps] [feigned surprise] Oh, my gosh! Moon Dancer?! Is that—
51200f Shh!
512003 Moon Dancer, can I talk to you for a min—
5122be Shh! What is this?
512003 Eh, a bubble of silence. I haven't seen you in a while and I thought it might be nice to catch up.
5122be For what purpose?
512003 You know, 'cause we're friends.
512000 [bubble pops]
51200f Shhh!
512003 I'm really sorry to bother you. I was just hoping we would go outside and talk for a bit.
512000 [page turning]
512003 [whispering] I'm sorry I skipped your party.
5122be [screams]
512000 [book closes]
51200f [Shhh! Quiet!]
5122be [growls] [whispering] Why won't you leave me alone? I'm trying to study! You've got the wrong pony! I don't have parties!
512003 [whispering] You did once. And I was so caught up in my own studying that I didn't take your feelings into account.
5122be [whispering] Look, Twilight Twinkle—
512003 [whispering] Sparkle.
5122be [whispering] Whatever! I just need to be alone so I can study without some crazy pony trying to make friends, all right?!
512003 [whispering] Fine!
5122be [whispering] Wait. How did you get into my book like that?
512003 I've been studying a new studying technique. I can only do it for a few minutes, but you'd be amazed how much you can pick up when you're actually in a book!
5122be It's one of Hayscartes' methods.
512003 You know Hayscartes?
5122be Of course! He's a genius!
512003 I have a copy of his Treatise on Ponies, you know.
5122be [gasps]
5122be What is this place?
512003 This is where I used to live. You mean, I never had you over?
5122be Wow! A first edition of Principles of Magic! Hey, didn't I give this to you?
512003 Maybe?
5122be I did! Look, I even wrote something! "To my friend, Twilight Sparkle. Thanks for introducing me to the classics." I can see by the fact that you left it here that it meant a lot to you.
512003 Look, I didn't bring you over here for even more poignant reminders of what a bad friend I was. I brought you here to give you this. You can come here whenever you want and study to your heart's content.
5122be Really?
512003 But first, you've gotta do something for me.
5122be What?
512003 Have dinner with our old friends tonight.
5122be I can't. I'm reorganizing my biology scrolls.
512003 I've been spending a lot of time with Minuette, Twinkleshine, and Lemon Hearts since I've been back. They really miss you.
5122be Look! I already told you! The last thing I need is a bunch of ridiculous friend-making keeping me from studying!
512003 Moon Dancer, wait! A wise pony once taught me that there's more to life than dusty old books!
5122be I tried friendship and it's just not for me. Now, if you'll excuse me...
512003 What if I taught you Hayscartes' method?
512199 So, uh, what are you studying these days?
5122be Science, magic, history, economics, pottery. Things like that.
512199 Yowza! [chuckles] You planning on being a professor or something?
5122be No.
512199 So you're just... studying.
5122be Can I go now?
512003 Moon Dancer, please.
512199 It's all right, Twilight. We're having a good time. Right, everypony?
5122bf [unsure sounds]
512199 So, uh... Spike, tell Moon Dancer that story 'bout how Twilight had to read a book about doing a sleepover!
512005 [inhales]
5122be Slumber 101? I've read that.
512003 Oh! [chuckles] Really? Well, uh, did you know Lemon Hearts here works at the Canterlot palace?
512098 Uh, yeah. It's true. I do the big events mostly. State dinners, that sort of thing.
5122c0 [awkward noises]
5122be Ugh!
512000 [teleportation zap]
512003 Moon Dancer! [teleportation zap] You've gotta give friendship a chance!
5122be Dah! I gave friendship a chance a long time ago! It didn't work out then – it isn't gonna work out now!
512005 Twilight, are you all right?
512003 No. No, I'm not.
512005 W-Where are you goin'?
512003 I don't know, Spike. I really messed this one up. That party was everything to her. I can only imagine what it must've felt like when I didn't show up.
512199 [flashback] Hey, Moon Dancer! Look at this spread, huh?
5122be [flashback] Thank you so much for coming!
512004 [flashback] Of course. We wouldn't miss one of our best friends' parties.
5122be [flashback] Is Twilight coming?
512000 [beat]
5122be [flashback] Oh. Okay.
512199 [flashback] Hey, we'll still have fun, right? [nervous chuckle]
5122be [flashback] Sure...
512003 If there was only a way to undo the damage... I know what I need to do. And I know just who can help me.
512199 [knocks on door] Huh. Guess they must've gone back to Ponyville.
512007 Wheeeeeeeee!
512199 Huh?
512007 [laughing] Whoooooaaa!
512000 [crash]
512007 That was awesome! We gotta go flying more often, Twilight!
512199 There you are! [laughs] I thought you threw in the old towel and headed home!
512003 I did head home. But not to throw in the towel. I went to get my secret weapon. Minuette, meet—
512199 Hey! Pinkie Pie!
512007 Hi, Minuette! Twilight, you didn't say Minuette would be here!
512003 You two know each other?
512007 Oh, sure! She was one of Cadance's bridesmaids! We hang out all the time when she's in Ponyville! Didn't you know that? Ha! And you call yourself the Princess of Friendship! Twilight briefed me on the way here. We'll need fifteen bags of confetti and as many hooves as we can get.
512199 Let's go! We can pass by the donut place on the way!
512005 And what are we gonna do?
512003 Just come with me.
5122be Ooh! A Brief History of the Wagon Harness! Huh? The Life and Times of Morari the Maneless?
5122be [gasps]
512000 [books thudding]
5122be What is this?
512003 It's a party. For you.
512007 Surprise!
512003 Come on in!
5122be Thanks but no thanks. I don't do parties.
512000 [teleportation zap]
512003 I know. And I think it's my fault. Back when we were in school together, you invited me to a party. I was so focused on my studies that I didn't show up.
5122be Big deal!
512003 It was a big deal. And now that I realize how important friendship is, I'd like to make up for my mistake with a new party. A party in honor of my friend Moon Dancer! Please, you've got to let me make this up to you.
5122be And you think this is gonna do it, huh?
512003 Uh, yes?
5122be Well, sure, why wouldn't it? That was only the first time I put myself out there, and then you didn't even bother to show up! Then you left town without saying goodbye even though we were supposed to be friends! I was humiliated! I felt like I wasn't important! I never wanted to let myself be hurt like that again! Those three finally convinced me that I had value! That other ponies might like me and want to be my friend! And you! Didn't! Show! Up! [screams, sobs]
512007 [whispers to Spike]
512003 You're right. This party can't make up for the way I hurt you. But please, don't let my mistake be the reason you can't be friends with anypony else.
512199 We were your friends then and we'd be honored to be your friends now.
5122be [sobs, sniffles] What? That's the librarian! The bookseller! My sister!
512199 You've got a lot of friends, Moon Dancer.
512003 I'm sorry, Moon Dancer. I've faced magical creatures, the end of Equestria, all sorts of things. But seeing how my actions affected you, that was one of the worst feelings I've ever had.
5122be [sobs] Thank you, Twilight. I never realized how much I needed to hear that. Now come on, everypony! Let's party! Right?
512007 Right!
512000 [party cannon squeak]
51204d YAAAAAAY!!!
512000 [polka]
512000 [ponies chattering]
512003 I think it's time for us to go, Moon Dancer.
5122be Thank you for helping me make some new friends. Even if they are my old friends.
512003 Oh. We'll come back and visit soon.
5122be That would be great! You've still gotta teach me that Hayscartes technique!
512003 Deal.
512005 Um, Moon Dancer? It got kinda banged up, but here's a little something I wanted to give you back at your first party.
5122c1 [chattering and shouting]
512000 [credits]
513000 [hooves galloping]
51301a Greetings, Tantabus. I am ready. Do your worst. [grunting]
513012 [gasps]
513003 Princess Luna's turning into Nightmare Moon again!
513011 [evil laughter]
51300c Yeah? Well, we've got the cure for that!
513000 [magic zaps]
513011 [evil laughter] Wait! What is it doing?! No! It's gone! [grunting]
513012 [cheering]
51301a [gasps] What? My dream ended... happily? That. Cannot. Happen!
513000 [theme song]
513007 Ooh, this is amazing!
51300c [yawns] [tired throughout] Yeah, Rarity. Thanks for setting all this up.
51300e [tired throughout] A grooming day for our pets really was a great idea.
51306a [yowls]
51300d [tired throughout] Oh, my! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get my normal beauty sleep last night...
51306a [hisses]
513003 [tired throughout] You know... [yawns] I didn't sleep well either.
513008 [tired throughout] Mm-hmm.
51300c Uh-huh.
513007 I'm totally beat too!
513028 [barks]
513008 All right, Winona. Time for your brushin'.
5130c6 [squeaks]
513000 [splash]
513008 Oops. I guess I'm too plumb tuckered out to do this right.
51300e [yawns] I even went to bed early last night... but then I had a really scary nightmare.
513015 Me too!
51300c Uh, only, you know, I didn't think mine was that scary!
513003 Well, mine sure was. There was this blue smoke monster and... what?
51300e I dreamt about a blue smoke thingy too!
513041 Me too!
51300c So what? Probably just a coincidence.
513003 That's an awfully big coincidence.
513005 Huh. I wonder why I didn't have that nightmare. I slept great!
51300d So then, what could've given us all the same nightmare?
513003 I don't know, but I do know who might. Spike, could you send a scroll to Princess Luna?
513005 Sure! All set!
513003 Dear Princess Luna, last night my friends and I all dreamt of a creature made of blue smoke. I'm sure you're very busy, but [yawns] when you have the chance, please let me know if you have any idea what it could mean. Yours, [yawns] Princess Twilight Sparkle. You can leave out the yawns.
513000 [scroll rustling]
513005 [blows fire]
513000 [bang]
51301a Which of you saw the creature of blue smoke in your nightmare?!
51300e Wow. That was fast.
513003 We all did.
513005 Not me!
51303e [simultaneously] Ugh, we know!
513003 So you've encountered the smoke monster too?
51301a The Tantabus is a creature of my nightmares. It escaped from my slumbers yesterday.
51300e But how did it get into ours?
51301a The Tantabus is like a parasite. My dreams must no longer be enough for it. Now it seeks others to infect and corrupt. It must have learned of you six from seeing you in my dream.
513005 Whoa-whoa-whoa. So what you're saying is... you dreamt about all of them, and not me? [whimpers]
51300c Uh, so Smokey gave us bad dreams. No biggie.
51301a I saw that the Tantabus had grown more powerful, but I did not realize that power was enough to enable it to escape my dreams. If its power grows, it could very well find a way to escape into the real world. It could turn all of Equestria into a living nightmare!
51300c Okay, okay, okay, I take it back! That does sound bad! Really bad!
513003 We've prepared everything exactly as you requested.
51301a Good. As you six slumber here, I will pursue the creature into whichever of your dreams it infests.
513007 Ooh! It'll be like a princess sleepover!
513003 Speaking of princesses, aren't you gonna ask Celestia for her help as well?
51301a There is nothing my sister can do. She has no power in the realm of sleep. Only I can move from dream to dream. I am afraid nopony can help me tonight.
513008 Even us?
51301a Especially you. You have all suffered so much because of me. You need only slumber while I hunt the Tantabus in your dreams.
513005 I know you said nopony can help, but I'm no pony! I'm gonna stay up and watch over you guys just in case!
513003 Aw, thank you, Spike!
513008 [yawns] One good thing about not sleepin' well last night – shouldn't be too hard to fall asleep now.
513007 Are you kidding?! This is so exciting, I don't know how I'm ever going to— [snores loudly]
5130d4 [sleeping noises]
513000 [magic noises]
51300d Oh, my! [gasps] This is simply divine! How avant garde!
513000 [dress roaring]
51300d Forget avant garde! I should have said en garde! [gasps]
51301a It is here!
513000 [dresses roaring]
51300d [gasps] It was such a pretty little chiffon...! What kind of monster would do this?!
51301a The Tantabus.
51300d Then let's stop it!
51301a No, please! I don't want you to suffer anymore because of me. I will catch it.
513000 [dresses roaring]
513000 [magic zaps]
513000 [bricks laying]
51301a It has jumped into another dream! I am sorry, but if I am to stop it, I must follow it where you cannot.
51300d Go! I should be able to handle things here. [gulps] I hope...!
513007 La-la-la-la-la! Whee! Whee, ha-ha!
513000 [dragon roaring]
513007 La-la-la-la-la!
51301a I followed the Tantabus here. Now I need only find—
513007 Sorry, can't help it! An idea pops into my head, it— [gasps] Ooh, cake!
513000 [splat]
513000 [cake growls]
513007 Ew, cake!
513000 [splat]
513000 [magic zap]
51301a [inhales] [grunts] No!
513007 Sorry!
513000 [magic zap]
513007 Who wants ice cream?!
51300e Mmm, it's so nice to be the pet for once.
513000 [magic zap]
5132c2 [roars]
51300e N-n-n-n-nice... giant... evil Angel...! [screams] Phew! Oh, thank you, princess!
513000 [magic zaps]
513000 [crunching]
513008 [sighs] Now this is what I call an incredible dream.
513000 [magic zaps]
513000 [punching and kicking]
51301a I can see the Tantabus has already turned your slumbers into a nightmare!
51300c What are you talking about? This is my favorite dream!
513000 [punch]
513000 [magic zap]
51300c Hyah!
5132c3 [singing to the tune of "This Old Man"]
5132c3 We are such happy flowers
5132c3 We will now sing for hours
5132c3 Aren't we unbearably cute?
5132c3 Watch me solo on jazz flute
513000 [flute solo]
51300c [screams]
513000 [books flapping]
513000 [magic zap]
513003 Huh? [gasps]
513000 [books chittering]
513003 [gasps]
513000 [magic zap]
513003 Luna!
513000 [crystals cracking]
513003 [yelping]
513012 [gasps]
513005 What happened? Are you guys okay?
51300e That... that was terrible! I-I never want to have that nightmare again!
51300c [shivers] Me either!
513005 But Luna caught it, didn't she?
51301a I am so sorry, my friends. I failed. It will be back to infect your dreams the next time you sleep.
51300e Oh, no!
513008 Yeah. I reckon I could live without seeing that thing ever again.
51301a But you will. Again and again, every night, until it grows powerful enough to infect the waking world! After what I did as Nightmare Moon, the fact that I am once again responsible for harming others is more than I can bear.
513007 It'll be okay! Everypony makes mistakes!
51301a As long as none of you dreamt about another pony, the Tantabus remains confined to your dreams. I still have a chance to catch it before it's too late.
513007 Phew, that's good to hear! Although after you left, I did happen to dream that I was eating a giant ice-cream cone with all of Ponyville while taking a test we hadn't studied for. See, what'd I tell ya? Everypony makes mistakes!
513003 But that means the Tantabus could be turning every dream in Ponyville into a nightmare!
51301a It is far worse than that. Infecting all those dreams gives it more and more power. Soon it will be able to escape into the real world and infect Equestria with its nightmare plague!
51300d Then you must let us help you stop it before that happens!
51300e But how? The Tantabus was able to escape Luna when it only had six dreams it could get to!
51301a It is true. With so many dreams to hide in, I do not know how I can catch it.
513003 Hmm... What if everypony in Ponyville were having one dream?
51301a I... can create shared dreams, yes, but for so many ponies at once? I have never done anything like that. The amount of power it would take...
51300e Well, it is worth a try, isn't it?
51301a Of course. I will do anything to end this, including accept your help. I cannot allow the Tantabus to escape into the real world. All of you must now go back to sleep and hope that I can create such a dream.
513005 [snoring]
513000 [magic zaps]
513000 [muffin squawks]
51313d [meows]
513003 [gasps] Princess Luna did it!
513008 [shivers] Big Mac! Boy, I'm glad to see somethin' familiar!
513026 Eeyup.
51301a Ponies!
51300f Princess Luna!
51301a There is no time for bowing, my friends! There is something coming, something terrible! No, it is already here!
513000 [Tantabus growling]
513000 [ponies screaming]
51301a I am so sorry! I brought this upon you! But I will end it now!
513000 [Tantabus noises]
513000 [ponies screaming]
513003 Princess, what's wrong?
51301a [grunts] It... is taking all my strength just to hold this massive dream together! You will have to stop it! I truly wish I did not have to ask this of you!
513003 Then you're in luck.
51300c Yeah! We're already on it!
513000 [house roaring]
513136 [yelping] Please! I'll pay you anything!
513000 [house roars]
51300c [kiai]
513000 [kick]
51300c I got you!
513000 [ponies screaming]
513000 [magic zap]
513217 [straining]
513000 [chomp]
513000 [house howling]
513000 [plant hissing]
513008 Oh, no!
513000 [muffin clucks]
513008 Big Mac! You can do anythin' in a dream, remember?
513000 [magic shimmering]
513026 Wheeeeee! [giggling]
51300c Come on! If that Tantabus thing turns any more of this dream against us, we'll be too busy saving ponies to catch it! And it'll grow powerful enough to escape into the real world!
513000 [muffin clucks]
513008 How are we even gonna know when it's able to escape?
51300c Oh, I think we'll know.
513000 [magic zaps]
513000 [Tantabus growling]
51301a [straining] Hurry, my friends!
513000 [zap]
51300c What the?!
51300e Please, we need your help too!
513000 [magic zap]
513003 Fluttershy's right! We've all got to work together to stop it from escaping!
51302b But how can we help? Nopony in Ponyville has your magic or your speed!
51300c That's true... in Ponyville!
513008 But this here isn't Ponyville! It's a dream!
513000 [muffins squawking]
513026 Eeyup!
513003 And not just any! This is your dream! Anything you can do in your dreams, you can do now!
513005 [clicks fingers] Well, if you're gonna dream, might as well dream big, right? Hi-yah!

513000 [wind noises]
51300c It's working!
513003 But it's not enough!
513000 [Tantabus roaring]
513007 Then do more! This is a dream, remember?
513000 [books chittering]
513000 [thumping]
51301a [straining] I cannot hold this dream together much longer! Equestria will fall because of me!
513000 [Tantabus roaring]
513005 Am I crazy, or did it just get even bigger after Luna said that?
513003 I think it's feeding off your guilt, Princess Luna!
51301a If that is so, then perhaps that is how it grew strong enough to escape in the first place!
513008 Say what now?!
51301a I created the Tantabus to give myself the same nightmare every night... [pants] ...to punish myself for the evil I caused as Nightmare Moon!
51300e But why would you do that?!
51301a To make sure I never forgave myself for how much Equestria suffered because of me! But it seems I have not learned my lesson, for now I have only made you suffer more!
513003 But that means you might just be the key to stopping all this!
51300c Yeah! If it gets strong because you feel bad about what you did as Nightmare Moon, then you just gotta stop feeling bad for what you did!
51301a How can I forgive myself? I am no better now than I was then. My creation is about to turn the world into a living nightmare!
513003 But look at what you're doing! Nightmare Moon would've wanted the Tantabus to turn Equestria into a nightmare! You're doing everything you can to stop it! Don't you see? That proves you're not the same pony you were then! Everypony who knows you knows that Nightmare Moon is in the past! We all trust you, Luna! Do you trust us enough to believe we're right?
513000 [Tantabus growling]
51301a ...I do!
513000 [Tantabus noises]
51301a Thank you. Thank you all.
513000 [rooster crowing]
513003 [gasps] Luna did it!
51300c [yawns]
513008 She sure did! Only... I'm not exactly sure what she did.
513003 Luna created the Tantabus to punish herself! The worse she felt, the more power it had! But once she finally forgave herself for what Nightmare Moon did...
513005 Poof!
51300e Shh!
513005 Huh. Wonder what she's dreaming about now.

514000 [bell ringing]
51400d [gasps] Was that the Pony Post?!
51406a [mewls]
51400d Oh, it's just you, Opal.
51406a [mewls]
51400d Ohhh... Every other day he's here like clockwork! Not today! What could possibly be holding him up?!
514000 [thonk]
514007 [muffled] Strawberry cinnamon cilantro salutations!
51400d What?
514007 What indeed. I bet you're wondering what warrants such a welcome! Well, that welcome is warranted by a pony that whisked up a warm batch of strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcakes!
514000 [thonk]
514007 [chomp] That strangely sickening flavor combination sounds just as bad as it tastes. [gulps] Ugh. So I came here to offer you some!
51400d After that visually descriptive and disturbing endorsement, I'll pass.
514007 Oh, I almost forgot! I have this letter for you, Rarity! The post pony was going to deliver it, but after a strawberry cinnamon cilantro cupcake, he was feeling kinda queasy. And since I was heading over anyway, I figured I could do it for him! Here you go!
51400d [gasps]
514000 [paper ripping]
51400d [inaudible reading]
514007 [chews]
51400d [loud gasp]
514007 [with mouth full] What's it say?
51400d I got it!
514007 Woo-hoo! Got what?
51400d Oh, I have been holding out for the perfect location, and it finally became available! So now I can fulfill my dream of opening a boutique in Canterlot!
514007 Whoo! I'm so excited, I think I'm gonna lose my cupcakes! [hurk]
514000 [theme song]
514000 [train brakes hissing]
514003 Rarity's such a savvy businesspony. I'm so impressed she used the huge bonus she earned making the costumes for Sapphire Shores' Equestria-wide tour to open this second boutique!
51406c [various exclamations of awe]
51400d I take it from your reaction that you like the boutique?
51400e It's lovely.
514008 Gosh, Rarity. I know hard work when I see it, and it looks like you worked your hooves to the nub!
514007 I don't know. Those hooves don't look nubby. They look scrubbied and buffied and pedied!
51400d Well, despite my 'nubby scrubby buffy pony pedi, I actually have been working very hard! However, I never could have gotten the boutique ready for the grand opening without the help of my new manager Sassy Saddles!
5142c4 Bust my buttons, Rarity! The ponies from Ponyville!
51406c [various greetings]
51400d I knew I needed a manager for Canterlot Carousel, so when Sassy showed me her resumé and I saw that she worked in all of the finest boutiques in Canterlot, I hired her right on the spot!
5142c4 I then laid out this plan, or "pattern" as we say in the fashion biz, for Canterlot Carousel so that Rarity's boutique will be a guaranteed success and those doors will never, ever, ever close!
514003 Wow, Sassy. Your attention to detail is truly impressive.
5142c4 I've already put a pin in the first piece of the pattern—Beautify the Boutique! But next was the very crucial pattern piece—Marketing to the Mares! Turns out that everypony here loves royalty!
51400d So I created a collection that beautifully revolves around the royal element of Canterlot!
5142c4 And it just so happens there's a hot new princess in Equestria!
51400d [to Twilight] In every poll Sassy Saddles took, you were the most popular princess! Coincidentally, one of my gowns is inspired by the window in Canterlot Castle commemorating your coronation!
514000 [curtains unfurling]
51406c [various exclamations of awe]
51400d While I've always prided myself on paying attention to detail, I've taken my latest collection to a whole new level with "Rarity's Rules of TLC"!
514007 Judging by this baby, TLC stands for Tasty Liquorice Candy!
514000 [thump]
51400d TLC stands for 'Time, Love, and Couture'. And while I do agree that this dress has potential, I've not had enough time to give it enough love to become couture.
514000 [door shuts]
51400d But the rest of the gowns in tonight's line have met Rarity's Rules and are ready to be presented!
5142c4 My marketing research also confirmed that customers that viewed somepony famous wearing a gown wish to own that gown for themselves. I call this piece of the pattern Celebrity Status!
51400d So, Twilight, we were wondering if perhaps you might possibly wear this tonight?
514003 If being a princess and wearing that dress can help your boutique in any way, then I say stick a pin in it. It's done.
5142c4 Alright, everypony! Let's set the stage!
51400d Ever since I was a little filly, all I've ever wanted was to own a boutique here in Canterlot. Somepony pinch me! I'm about to open the doors to that very boutique!
514000 [door opens]
5142c4 Welcome to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel!
514000 [crowd cheers]
5142c4 Oh, hello! Oh, nice to see you! Welcome, welcome! Oh, I'm so happy to... [fades out]
514008 That Sassy totally stepped on your hooves, Rarity.
514007 Oh, no! Did she mess up that nice pony pedi?! [sighs] Okay. Phew!
51400d Oh, I don't think she meant to.
5142c4 Rarity, are you ready to reveal the collection?
514008 [under her breath] Is she sure she doesn't wanna do it herself?
51400c [snorts] [under her breath] Yeah.
51400d Yes, I am. Fluttershy, could you help Twilight get ready?
51400e Oh, certainly.
514000 [customers chattering]
51400d Fillies and gentlecolts! I am designer and couturier Rarity, I'd like to welcome you—again [laughs nervously]—to the grand opening of Canterlot Carousel, and I'm thrilled that you are here to see my newest collection inspired by this regal city!
514000 [crowd oohs]
514000 [camera clicking]
514000 [BGM starts]
5142c5 Rarity, I'm—
51400d Fashion Plate of Cosmare magazine! I'm so honored that Cosmare was able to do a piece on the grand opening of my boutique!
5142c5 Well, when Sassy Saddles calls, saying she's found the latest and greatest in fashion, we hightail without fail! Now tell me all about your latest collection!
51400d Oh, uh, it's called "Rarity's Royal Regalia".
5142c5 [gasps] Royally radiant!
51400d My favorite part of being a designer is finding my inspiration, and that really wasn't difficult when it came to Canterlot. Everywhere I looked, the royal city just spoke to me! I call it "In-spire-ation".
514000 [crowd oohs]
5142c5 Genius! Simply genius!
51400d I spent hours by the lily pond on the castle grounds, which inspired this gown—"Water Filly"!
514000 [crowd oohs]
5142c5 Oh, the whimsy!
51400d Watching Celestia raise the sun each morning literally lit up my day... [beat] This is "Tripping the Light".
514000 [crowd oohs]
5142c5 Fantastic!
51400d [giggles] And of course, Luna raising the moon guided me to sleep. I call this "Over the Moon"!
514000 [crowd oohs]
5142c5 Well, I certainly am!
51400d And for our finale, I have something very special. I was inspired by the stained glass window created in honor of Princess Twilight... I call this "The Reign in Stain"!
5142c5 Because the dress is inspired by the—
5142c6 —stained glass window of a reigning princess!
51400d Yes!
5142c4 Oh, well, I think "The Reign in Stain" is too difficult to explain! [short laugh] Especially for the signature piece of a collection?
51400d But I rather like the—
5142c4 Fillies and gentlecolts, I, Sassy Saddles, am pleased to introduce the grand finale of the grand opening of Rarity's Royal Regalia – the "Princess Dress"!
5142c5 [gasps] Success!
514000 [crowd oohing and chattering]
5142c4 Everypony, please follow me and you can all place your orders for the Princess Dress!
514000 [crowd chattering]
5142c5 Rarity, I want to be the first pony to congratulate you! The Princess Dress has just guaranteed Canterlot Carousel's success! [gasps]
514000 [crowd chattering]
5142c7 [various congratulations]
514003 Yeah! Rarity's Royal Regalia is amazing! And everypony seemed to love the Princess Dress!
5142c4 You bet your saddle they did. Rarity now has one hundred orders for her signature gown!
51400d [stammers] One hundred orders?! All at one time?!
5142c4 According to my pattern, the next piece is The Success of the Signature Dress, so I do not see the problem!
514000 [beat]
514008 Uh...
514007 Cupcake?
51400d [clears throat] First of all, Sassy Saddles, I would have appreciated getting to name the final gown from my collection myself.
5142c4 [short laugh] My research shows that your "Reign in Stain" name was a play on words that was both very confusing and quite unappealing.
51400d [disgruntled laugh] While I see your point, we should have discussed it prior to the grand opening, Sassy.
5142c4 My only goal is for Canterlot Carousel to succeed. That's why I changed the name, and that is why I took all those orders for the Princess Dress.
51400d [stammering] But... But receiving orders for one hundred dresses in one day, [stammering] it's just too much too soon!
5142c4 Are you actually saying we should... cancel these orders?!
51400d Wha... But... [stammering] Uh, n-no, Sassy. Promises were made, and I shall sew my very best to provide each and every pony a Princess Dress full of TLC.
5142c4 Oh, thank you, Rarity, thank you!
51400d [sighs]
5142c4 Oh, satin and silk, Rarity, are you sure you don't want your friends to help you make the dresses?
51400d No, Sassy. These orders are my responsibility. All I have to do is stick to my plan so I can deliver each and every Princess Dress in keeping with my Rules of Rarity!
51400d [Rarity]
51400d The rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality
51400d This I can assure
51400d For each and every dress
51400d I vow to give finesse
51400d With time, love, and couture
51400d My favorite moment's when a pony sees it
51400d That special gown that she just adores
51400d That pony's now in style
51400d My hard work's all worthwhile
51400d Oh, yes, it makes my heart
51400d My heart just soar
514000 [instrumental]
51400d [Rarity]
51400d The rules of Rarity, just a parody
51400d No dress here's unique
51400d The panels all the same
51400d Each colored windowpane
51400d I fashion only makes me want to shriek!
514000 [sighs]
514000 Oh, to create would give me elation
514000 To feel once again some inspiration
514000 Come on now, Rarity
514000 Give me some clarity
514000 Time for your couture love to rule
514000 The rules of Rarity, extra TLC
514000 This feels more sublime
514000 Soon now, they will see how good these can be
514000 With a little extra shine
514000 The rules of Rarity, guaranteed quality
514000 All can see it's true
514000 These new gems add such flair
514000 Their beauty can't compare
514000 This old style suddenly gleams anew
514000 [humming]
514000 [door opens]
514000 [bell rings]
51400d Is that the customer who ordered this Princess Dress?
5142c4 I'll take care of her. You keep working.
51400d Uh, actually, I'd love to see her reaction to this particular dress.
5142c4 Paisley and poplin, Rarity, look at all the orders you still have to finish, and you want to take a break? Now?
51400d Well, it's just I made some really lovely changes to this dress—
5142c4 You did what?! But every Princess Dress is supposed to be exactly the same!
51400d Yes yes I know, but these gems just spoke to me, and—
5142c4 Fine. Go see her reaction.
51400d Hello, and welcome to Canterlot Carousel! I am so pleased to present to you your—
5142c8 Princess Dress! Finally! I've been simply desperate to get this ever since I saw Princess Twilight wearing it on your— ...Wait a minute. There's something different.
51400d Well as an artiste, I did take the liberty to change a few minor details.
514000 [beat]
51400d I, eheh, I saw these gems glistening in the light, and they just spoke to me. Aren't they lovely? And so unique!
5142c8 [sigh] They're... fine. But they're not what I ordered, are they?
51400d Uh, no. No, they're not.
5142c8 I want the dress to be exactly like the one Princess Twilight wore. Understand?
51400d Yes... Y-Yes, of course.
51400d [Rarity]
51400d The rules of Rarity
51400d Once stood for something
51400d But now it feels just like some factory
51400d Now every dress I make
51400d With every flaw and mistake
51400d Oh, how it makes my heart
51400d My heart just break
514000 [sewing machine whirring]
5142c4 Raving rick-rack, Rarity! You made two hundred Princess Dresses!
51400d [deadpan] Yes. Isn't it spectacular?
5142c4 And I have a special surprise for you! The latest issue of Cosmare magazine just hit the stands!
51400d [reading] "Canterlot's newest rising star"?
5142c4 And in the hour since the magazine's come out, we've gotten another hundred new orders for the Princess Dress!
514000 [thud]
51400d [weakly] One... hundred more... Princess Dresses?! I'm the Cosmare cover pony... I have the most successful shop in Canterlot... I've gotten everything I ever wanted... but I'm miserable!
5142c4 [short laugh] How could you possibly be miserable? My pattern is perfect! Cosmare Cover Pony – done! You have your signature gown, the Princess Dress of Success!
51400d I don't want to make another hundred Princess Dresses!
5142c4 I have a piece for that! Assemble the Assembly Line! You'll never have to sew again!
51400d What?! No!
5142c4 Yes! Then the Canterlot Carousel never closes! And Sassy Saddles' boutique succeeds!
51400d Stop! This is not your boutique! And if this is what success in Canterlot looks like, I want no part of it! Now, make up flyers for a going-out-of-business sale! I'm closing Canterlot Carousel!
5142c4 What?! No! Oh, you can't, Rarity! I-I've worked too hard to make this a success! I can't be a part of another failed boutique!
514000 [door closes]
514000 [hooks clinking]
51400d [to a dress] Oh, don't you look lovely? Nice to see you out here again. [to herself, hushed] Seems Sassy Saddles isn't rushing to open the door this time. Hm.
514000 [door opens]
51400d Welcome to the going-out-of-business sale of Canterlot Carousel.
514000 [ponies chattering]
5142c9 Hey, is this Princess Dress on sale?
51400d Oh, no, I'm sorry, the Princess Dress has been discontinued. But there are plenty of other lovely dresses on sale today.
5142ca [flatly] Whoa. This dress completely speaks to my soul. Can I try it on?
51400d Certainly. The dressing area is right back there.
5142cb This is the most amazing of amazing dresses! Just looking at it brightens my day!
51400d And I'm sure you'll feel even brighter once you try it on!
5142cc Do you still have this In-spire-ation dress that's in the new issue of Cosmare?
51400d Oh, yes, I do. It's-It's right here.
5142cc Bats in the belfry! I have to try it on!
5142ca [flatly] Whoa. This dress makes me feel like a princess.
5142cb And this dress makes me feel like a princess!
5142cd This gown is quite beautiful, but it totally clashes with my complexion.
51400d Hmmm. Perhaps you'd be even more taken with this one. It was inspired by the fountain in the Canterlot Castle garden. I call it the "Fountain of Truth"!
5142cd It's exactly what I've been dreaming of!
51400d Oh! Well, then I'll finish it, and the gown shall be yours! [to herself] How can I have forgotten? This is what I've been dreaming about!
51400d [Rarity]
51400d My favorite moment's when a pony sees it
51400d That special gown that she just adores
51400d That pony's now in style
51400d My hard work's all worthwhile
51400d Oh, yes, it makes my heart
51400d My heart just soar!
51400d Attention, everypony! Canterlot Carousel will not be closing!
514000 [crowd cheering]
5142ca [flatly] But this stuff's still on sale, right?
51400d [giggles] Yes, yes, of course.
5142c4 Oh, Rarity, I'm so sorry. I focused on that one dress, and the rest of Rarity's Royal Regalia paid the price.
51400d Well, so did the Princess Dress. The more I sold, the more each dress lost its time, love, and couture, becoming terrible, lackluster, and common.
5142c4 I think I finally understand the Rules of Rarity... and will apply them at my next job.
51400d I beg your pardon? The Rules of Rarity are only to be applied at Canterlot Carousel! Which is why you must continue to manage the boutique while I'm in Ponyville.
5142c4 Ponyville?
51400d Well, yes, I'll come to Canterlot with new designs and to see the customers of course, but Ponyville was always going to be my home base.
5142c4 [gasps] Bobbins and bodkins, Rarity! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! And I promise to run everything following your rules.
51400d I would expect nothing less.
5142ce Oh, my gosh, a sale! Do you have the Princess Dress?!
5142cf No! [laughing]
514000 [credits]
51500d Oh, Sassy Saddles, don't you just love my new Femme Mystique Chic line of gowns?
5152c4 [gasps] Sequins and sashes, Rarity, they're exquisite! Where in Equestria did you find the inspiration?
51500d Oh, I modeled them after the adventures of Shadow Spade. Her stories are always full of mystery and suspense and, best of all... fabulous costumes!
5152c4 They're perfect! [beat] What are you doing?
51500d [humming] Oh, uh, just making some minor adjustments. [blows on dress] Shadow Spade believes it all comes down to attention to detail. And so do I. There! Now it's perfect.
515000 [door slams open]
51500c Hey guys, how's it—
515000 [crash]
5152cf [distressed squealing]
51500c [nervous laughing] My bad.
515000 [theme song]
51500c [groans] Sorry I messed up your dress thingy.
5152c4 Nothing we can't fix in a stitch. What are you doing in Canterlot?
51500c I'm here for Princess Celestia's royal garden opening tomorrow.
5152c4 Oh, yes! Rumor has it the gardens are especially lush this season. I heard that the Wonderbolts will be kicking things off with an aerial display.
51500d You heard right. And Rainbow Dash is here to fly with them. So exciting!
51500c Well, kind of exciting. Technically, I'm not flying. I'm just the lucky Reserve who was called in to be the backup flyer in case a Wonderbolt can't perform.
51500d Oh, don't be so modest. Out of all the Reserves, you were the one chosen.
51500c It is pretty sweet. And I do get to stay in the castle, hang out with the Wonderbolts, and eat awesome food at the dinner tonight. Speaking of the dinner, you're still coming, right?
51500d Heavens, yes! A chance to dress up, be charming and show off my newest femme mystique couture? I wouldn't miss it for all of Equestria.
51500c Great! See ya tonight!
515000 [door closes]
515000 [mannequins rattling]
515000 [door slams open]
515000 [crash]
51500d Ooh, the rhinestones I ordered! [beat] Oh, my. Oh, there's been a mistake... I ordered dragon-cut stones, and these are hoof-polished.
5152d0 I'm sorry, but I've got a full load of deliveries today. I'm not sure I have time to redo your order.
51500d Of course you don't. Your job is so difficult. Honestly, I don't know how you keep all of those orders straight.
5152d0 [chuckle] It is pretty tough, what with the boxes all being... box-shaped.
51500d Oh, y—oh yes, and I very much appreciate it. But if there was any way you could squeeze in one more little delivery, I would be eternally grateful.
5152d0 [laughs nervously] Well, for you, Rarity, I'll see what I can do.
515000 [door closes]
5152c4 Rarity, you could sweet-talk a filly out of candy!
51500d Oh, [chuckles], it was nothing. Nopony minds a compliment. Now, you simply must help me pick out an outfit for tonight. Something from the new collection, of course.
515000 [general background chatter]
51500c Let's grab some grub!
51500d [sniffs] Mm, is that Juniper Phoenix I smell?
51500c No, it's broccoli! [chewing]
5152d1 Yeah, Juniper Phoenix is one of my favorite stallion colognes.
51500d Oh, mine as well. It's masculine and yet—
515000 [plate smashes]
51500d —soft with the barest hint of floral notes and—
51500c [hushed] Rarity! Don't you know who this is?!
51500d A gentlepony with fabulous taste in colognes and scarves?
51500c It's Wind Rider!
51500d Oh! So nice to meet you!
51500c You didn't let me finish! He's a living legend. He holds the Wonderbolt record in the Mustang Marathon!
5152d1 Well, that was a long time ago. Honestly, I can't believe I still hold the record.
51507c Wind Rider, I see you met Rainbow Dash! She's one of our most promising Reserves. She just might beat your record.
5152d1 Really now?
51500c Oh, heh, I'm nowhere near as good as you. I mean, I'm fast, but I don't have the endurance to go long distances.
51507c Ah, don't be modest. A little practice and you'll be beating records in no time.
5152d1 Heh-heh. Well, it's nice to meet you fillies.
51500c [sighs] Not as nice as it is to meet you, sir. [barely-contained laughter] I can't believe I just met Wind Rider!
51507a Yeah, he's coming out of retirement to take the spot of honor in the center of our aerial flower formation tomorrow.
51500c [gasps] Really? That's incredible! Guess I'll just watch Wind Rider being awesome from the sidelines... practice tomorrow is gonna be so boring.
51500d I don't suppose I could keep you company?
51500c You could! They always let friends and family come watch practices!
515000 [splash]
51500d Mm, ooh!
51500c Oops. Heh, sorry about that. Lemme help you clean that up. [hocks and spits]
51500d Uh, no-no, it's almost impossible to get stains out of silk. But not to worry. I've come prepared!
51500d That dinner was absolutely divine. Thanks for inviting me! Ooh, you're staying in the east tower? Those rooms have the best view of Canterlot!
51507c How lucky are we? Well, we better get some shuteye before practice.
515000 [door shuts]
51500c See you tomorrow, Rarity!
51500d Good night!
51500c [sighs] Thanks for keeping me company, Rarity. If you weren't here, well, I don't know who I'd be talking to right now.
515000 [splat]
51507b Eh, you'd be talkin' to me. Rainbow Dash, Spitfire's mom sent a message that she was sick. She had to leave to take care of her.
51500c [gasps] Oh, no! I hope her mom's okay!
51507b Me too. In the meantime, we need you to fly in her place.
51500c L-Like, in the actual show?
51507b Unless Spitfire comes back, yes.
51500c I won't let you down, Soarin! [squeals] This is the best thing ever! Ohmygoshohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh! [sing-song] I'm gonna get to fly with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, 'cause I'm the bestest and I'm awesome and they know it! [continues under] Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh...
51507b Uh... Rainbow Dash?
51500d [hushed] Shh! Let her have this, darling.
51500d Hello there! Friend or family?
5152d2 Family. My daughter's a Wonderbolt, but I don't see her up there. Do you know Spitfire?
51500d Ooh, you're Spitfire's mum? But I thought you were sick.
5152d2 What?
51500d Well, Spitfire got a note from you saying you weren't feeling well, and she went home to take care of you.
5152d2 I didn't send a note.
51500d That's so strange.
51507b Stormy Flare? Aren't you supposed to be sick? 'Kay, what's happening?
5152d2 I don't know. But I do know I didn't send my daughter a note.
51500d Could somepony have sent Spitfire a fake note?
51507a Who would do such a thing?
51507b Somepony who wanted her out of the show, I suppose.
51500c Why would anypony want that?
5152d1 Maybe so they could take her spot.
51500c Me?! I would never do that to Spitfire! Why would you think it was me?
5152d3 I did see you and Spitfire leave the dinner together.
51500c We were room neighbors in the castle!
51507a And you did say you'd do anything to fly with Wind Rider.
51500c Yeah, but I didn't mean anything.
51507b Spitfire came by my room and told me she had to go see her mom at around midnight. Where were you then?
51500c I was asleep at midnight... having this totally amazing dream. There I was at the arena flying with Wind Rider and the Wonderbolts, like I've always wanted to—
515000 [camera flashes]
51500c —ah, eh, never mind. Not helping.
515000 [Wonderbolts whispering]
51507b Rainbow Dash, if you can prove that somepony else is behind Spitfire's disappearance before the start of the show, then you can still fly with us. In the meantime, Misty Fly, Blaze, head over to Stormy Flare's house and try to find Spitfire and bring her back. [to Rainbow Dash] I have to warn you, if you sent that letter, the bylaws are clear. I'd have no choice but to ban you from the Wonderbolts forever. Understand?
51500c [sighs] I understand. But how am I gonna prove I didn't send a letter that I didn't send?
51500d With me! Detective Rarity is on the case, and we are going to get to the bottom of this faster than my costume change!
51500c Yeah, what's with the getup?
51500d Obviously, I am channeling Shadow Spade through these gorgeous garments, and she would say that the best way to prove that you didn't send the letter is to find out whoever did. First stop – the scene of the crime!
515000 [noir music plays]
51500d [narrating] We had a long road ahead of us, Rainbow Dash and I. Well, not too long because we didn't have much time, but the point is... I was up for the challenge.
515000 [drawers opening and closing]
51500d [narrating] There I was, surveying the crime scene, and looking très chic while doing it. [normally] This must be the envelope for the letter Spitfire got! [sniffs] Hmm. These look like hairs from a rainbow mane!
51500c [gulps] That's not good.
51500d [narrating] Rainbow Dash was getting antsy, but I had faith I could clear her name and find the real culprit.
51500c What are you doing?
51500d [stammers] Uh, just thinking thoughts. [narrating] Rainbow Dash was right. In order to solve the mystery, we had to be focused. Driven. One hundred percent in the— [normally] Ooh! The damask pattern on these curtains is exquisite! Oh, and this velvet rope-holder – oh, it's just—
51500c We don't have time to look at the décor! They're gonna kick me out of the Wonderbolts unless we solve this thing!
51500d I know, Rainbow, and I'm on this case like a charm on a bracelet! Here's what I'm thinking - somepony had to bring Spitfire that letter, which means somepony must have seen them!
51500d I just have a few questions for you, and I'm sure once we get some things cleared up, we'll—
51500c Come on, Rarity, we don't have all day! [to a guard] Where were you on the night of last night at midnight?!
5152d4 We were here, guarding the hallway entrance like we were supposed to.
51500c A likely story.
5152d4 I'm telling you, we were there all night, and no one went in or out of that hallway.
5152d5 Except for you.
51500c What are you tryin' to say?!
5152d5 Just that there are only two rooms in the northwest wing - yours and Spitfire's. So the only other pony who had access to that wing was you.
51500d [narrating] The waters were getting choppy. Rainbow Dash's tactics were, well, horrid. It was time for another approach. [normally] Perhaps I should take it from here! You castle guards have such a difficult job. I'm guessing that at times it can be rather... boring.
5152d4 It is. I've counted all three hundred and forty five bolts in the ceiling tiles two hundred and ninety three times!
51500d And of course being a castle guard can be thankless work. I'm not saying you did, but if you took a break, you more than deserved it.
5152d4 Oh, you're right. We don't get a lot of recognition for what we do.
5152d5 Except for last night when somepony was nice enough to leave a cake for us. So we did take one little break when we ate that cake.
51500d What kind of cake was it?
5152d5 Cherry with a custard filling.
51500d Was the frosting vanilla or chocolate?
5152d4 Chocolate.
51500d Was the base of the cake decorated with buttercream rosettes?
5152d4 It was.
51500c Ugh, who cares how it was decorated?!
51500d [narrating] Rainbow Dash was questioning my methods. But I knew what I was doing.
51500c Do you?
51500d Oh, oh, oh. Did I say that one out loud?
51500c I mean, even I think I'm guilty at this point! I really did want to fly in that show! What if I wrote that note when I was asleep?! Do you know what I do when I sleep?! Because I sure don't!
51500d Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash. We'll get to the bottom of this. There's only one bakery in Canterlot that makes a chocolate cherry cake with custard filling and buttercream frosting rosettes and that's...
51500d ...Cinnamon Chai's Tea and Cake Shop!
5152d6 Hello, how can I help you?
51500d I've heard you have the best chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!
5152d6 Ah, you travel in the right circles! We have the only chocolate cherry custard cake with buttercream frosting rosettes in town!
51500d Oh, no. But somepony's already bought it! Who was the lucky pony?
5152d6 [beat] I can't even say!
51500d Why? Because it was somepony famous?
5152d6 No... because it was hard to tell! She was wearing a trench coat, sunglasses, and a scarf around her head that covered most of her face. But I do remember she had a really deep, raspy voice.
51500c What do you mean, raspy?
5152d6 Well, kinda like yours.
51500c [gulps]
51500d If there's anything else you can remember, dish.
5152d6 Well, have I got a story for you! The pony who bought the cake threw a big fit when she accidentally got chocolate ganache on her scarf!
51500d That's terrible! What color was the scarf?
5152d6 White! No, maybe more an ivory...
51500d You don't say!
51500c I can't believe you're talking fashion at a time like this!
51500d Rainbow, don't panic. I need you to trust me.
51500c Trust you?! You've spent more time changing clothes than trying to help me! I'm doomed!
51500d No, you're not! Come on!
51500d [narrating] Rainbow Dash was obviously upset, but I had all my ducks in a row. Except one.
515000 [duck quacks]
51500d [narrating] She was not going to like it, but there was only one way to find out if my suspicions were correct.
515000 [rain pouring]
515000 [door opens]
5152d3 We looked everywhere, but Spitfire wasn't at her mom's house!
5152d2 Where could she be?
515000 [door opens]
515000 [lightning cracks]
51500d I have found the culprit!
51507b [gulps]
51500d Somepony sent Spitfire away and framed Rainbow Dash for it. And that pony was none other than... Wind Rider!
515000 [lightning cracks]
515000 [Wonderbolts expressing surprise]
51500c Rarity, I can't believe you would accuse Wind Rider of framing me! He's a living legend, for pony's sake!
51500d All the evidence points to him!
51500c Peh! What evidence could you possibly have? All you did was ask about cake, admire décor, and change outfits a gazillion times!
51500d Let me explain. I never believed you would send Spitfire away. When we found the rainbow hairs in Spitfire's room, I could tell they didn't fall out. They... were cut! Nopony loses hair in a chunk. And look at the ends. It's a straight line! They were clearly cut with shears, which means somepony planted it! Then when we were examining Spitfire's room, I smelled something on the envelope. Juniper Phoenix, Wind Rider's cologne of choice! Then, in the castle hallway, I noticed some of the damask curtains fell out of their velvet rope-holder, indicating that somepony had been hiding behind them! Perhaps after they dropped off the fake letter?
5152d1 Juniper Phoenix is a very popular fragrance, and anypony could have moved those curtains.
51500d Precisely why I questioned the castle guards! They were at their post at the entrance to the hallway all night, except for a small window of time when somepony brought them cake. A cake that was ordered by a girl pony with a raspy voice! Whoever ordered the cake got a chocolate stain on her ivory scarf, and I couldn't help but notice that Wind Rider's scarf is tied in a tight Windsor knot instead of its usual loose slipknot! And why is that? Is it to hide the chocolate stain?!
515000 [Wonderbolts gasping]
5152d1 Ah, this is preposterous. Wonderbolts, you don't believe a word of this, right?
51500d Just admit it – you're as guilty of framing Rainbow Dash as you are of ruining that ivory scarf!
5152d1 Ah, fine! You caught me! I did it!
51500c But why, Wind Rider?! Was it because I took the last broccoli at the dinner and you really, really wanted it?
51500d No. It was because he was afraid that you would break his long-distance Wonderbolt record! I heard him when Spitfire said you were close to breaking his record. He said, and I quote, 'Heh-heh'. That's the polite but disingenuous laugh you make when you want to seem happy but really you're not.
5152d1 I thought if I could get Rainbow Dash kicked out of the Wonderbolts forever, my record could be preserved.
51500c Really? That is so not cool. And I thought you were the coolest Wonderbolt ever. Until now.
5152d1 I did what I had to do to protect my record! Sometimes you gotta play dirty to be the best!
51500c That's not what being a Wonderbolt is all about.
51507b She's right! Wonderbolts look out for each other! Which reminds me, where is Spitfire?
5152d1 I sent her the letter pretending to be Stormy Flare. I told her I had Pegasitis, and the only cure is the ice iris in the Crystal Mountains.
51500c No wonder she's been gone so long. Ice irises are almost impossible to find in spring!
51507b The Crystal Mountains are too far for anypony to make it there and back before the royal garden opening! Rainbow Dash, we need you to fly in Spitfire's place!
51500c But Spitfire shouldn't have to miss this! I'm gonna get her!
51507b But you'll never make it in time!
51500c Then there's no time to lose!
5152d3 Rainbow Dash is still gone!
51500d Oh, don't panic. If I know Rainbow Dash, she'll come through.
515000 [door opens]
51507c [panting]
51507b Spitfire, you're back! I can't believe you made it!
51507c [out of breath] I wouldn't have, if Rainbow hadn't found me so fast! Gave me enough time to fly back!
51500c Rare, I couldn't have done it without you. And I'm sorry I doubted you. But why didn't you tell me what you were doing?
51500d Well, I didn't want to get your hopes up until I was sure, and I couldn't be sure until I saw that chocolate stain.
51500c Thank you for believing in me, even when I was doubting you. I'm some friend, huh?
51500d Actually, you're quite a good friend. You went to get Spitfire, even though it meant you couldn't fly today.
51500c [sighs] I'll get my chance one day.
51507c Or today. How'd you like Wind Rider's spot in the show?
5152d1 Uh, w-w-what? Y-You can't do this to me! I'm one of the greatest Wonderbolts there ever was!
51507c Not anymore. For attempting to frame Rainbow Dash, I hereby strip you of your Wonderbolts status!
51507b [to Rainbow Dash] So, would you like to fly with us?
51500c Would I?! Woo-hoo! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, aww yeah...
51507b Uh, Rainbow Dash?
51500c [embarrassed noise] Coming!
51500d [narrating] So my friend got her moment in the sun. Or the center of an aerial flower, as the case may be. And as for me? I got a chance to show off my Femme Mystique Chic collection!
5152d2 That's nice, dear.
51500d Oh, did I say that out loud?
515000 [noir music plays over credits]
516003 Ehh... [blows raspberry] [sighs heavily, groans, sighs again] I'm bored.
516005 But you're reading.
516003 I've read all these books already.
516005 And...?
516003 And I'm bored! I wanna do something! Things have been so slow around here and I just—
51600d Twilight! Twilight! Ooh, Twilight, darling! Oh, thank goodness! It seems that my—
516008 [panting] Whew! Got here as fast I—
516003 [gasps] Yes! Finally! We've been summoned! I wonder where the map wants us to—
516005 Uh, Twilight?
516003 [groans]
516000 [theme song]
516008 Where do you think—
51600d [excited squeals] Manehattan! We've been called to Manehattan! Oh, I've simply been dying to go back for a visit! And now I return... with a purpose!
516003 Hmmm. It looks like you've been summoned to this particular neighborhood here.
51600d We're off to solve a friendship problem in one of the busiest and most vibrant cities in all of Equestria! Isn't this exciting?! [squeals]
516008 Seems a hair odd, though, don't it? Map callin' me to a big city like Manehattan?
516003 You may be more of a country pony at heart, Applejack, but the map picked you two because you're the best ponies to tackle this particular mission.
516008 But how will we even know what our mission's supposed to be? That neighborhood probably has twice as many ponies as all of Ponyville.
51600d Pff. Kch. Ts! More like three times! Why, it's not only home to the Haypacking District – it's also home to the Fashion District! [to Twilight] Hmm. Shame you weren't called as well, though, darling. You did end up quite a fan of the hustle and bustle of Manehattan on our last visit.
516003 It's such an exciting city, and there's still so much I'd like to do there. So many museums and historical landmarks to visit. Not to mention all the libraries! But this is your mission. Heh-heh. Don't worry about me. I've got plenty of... books... to keep me... busy.
516005 [scoffs]
516043 Mm-hmm.
51600d [gasps] I just remembered something! The Sisterhooves Social!
516008 We'll have to miss it. No tellin' how long we'll be in Manehattan. I sure hope Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle aren't too upset.
516000 [train chugging]
516000 [city noises]
51600d Oh, Manehattan, what you do to me!
516008 [gulps]
51600d Darling, are you all right?
516008 Ponies move so fast here. Not at all like back home. [to herself] Eyes peeled, ears open. Eyes peeled, ears open.
516115 [blows police whistle]
51600d Remember, Applejack, you're in the big city now. No moseying. You've gotta walk with speed and confidence!
516115 [blows police whistle]
51600d Yoo-hoo!
516008 [snorts]
5162d7 Move it!
516008 Sorry 'bout that.
5162d8 Ah, get outta my way!
516008 Sorry.
5162d9 Watch it!
516008 Hey— Oh, dear. Butter my biscuits. I can barely cross the street in this town. How am I supposed to help solve a—
51600d [gasps] There!
5162da Yes, I think this is the one.
51600d No! No.
5162da Excuse me?
51600d That hat clashes with your mane, not to mention it's far too large and will undoubtedly obstruct your vision. Oh, dear, none of these will do. Oh, Applejack! What good timing!
516000 [bonk]
51600d [humming] Here. This will do splendidly.
5162da Oh, it's lovely! How much would you like for it?
51600d Oh, no-no, please, please, keep it. I can always make another.
5162da Thank you!
51600d [to Applejack] And you thought we wouldn't discover our purpose here! Pff. Kch. Ts!
516008 Yeah, I'm pretty sure that wasn't it.
51600d What? We just saved that poor pony from committing a terrible crime of fashion.
516000 [beat]
51600d Well, she could've been meeting a friend who would've laughed at her new hat, and then their friendship could've been ruined forever! And... mmm... it's possible.
516008 Did your cutie mark glow signifyin' a job well done?
51600d Ye— No. I suppose it didn't. Still, a disaster was averted!
5162db Averted? You just lost me a paying customer!
51600d Oh, my! Oh, I-I-I-I-I'm s-so sorry. I never meant to—
5162db Beat it!
51600d Uh, please accept my sincerest apologies for the misunderstanding, and might I add, what a lovely establishment you have here! [nervous laugh] [clears throat] You're right, Applejack. [sighs] The search continues.
516008 Uh, 'scuse me, I was just wonderin'... Uh, friendship problem, anypony? See, we've been sent here to... A-A map summoned us and, uh... If you could just take a moment to...
51600d Friendship advice! Anypony looking for friendship advice! Good grief. This isn't working.
516008 [sighs] I'm not sure what we're supposed to do. To be honest, I'm still not even sure what the map called me here for.
51600d Oh, try not to worry, Applejack. The map picked us for a reason. Although how we're supposed to uncover that reason, I haven't a clue. We can't possibly approach every single pony in town until we find out what we're meant to d—ooh! [reading] "Please help us restore our long-lost but beloved tradition, the Midsummer Theater Revival. There's a guest performance by a local theater troupe, the Method Mares, as well as games, food, and much, much more. This event promises to bring our Bronclyn neighbors together and restore our sense of community, but there's so much to do and we need your help." Huh. [gasps] Darling, this is it! The contact on the flyer is Coco Pommel!
516008 Oh, right! She's the one you got a job makin' costumes for that designer friend o' yours.
51600d Don't you see?! This must be why the map called us here! Oh, and you were so worried!
516008 Well, I suppose it's at least worth lookin' into... that is, if we can ever get off this street corner.
51620e I can't believe you found my flyer. Quite a coincidence, don't you think?
51600d Applejack and I were specifically summoned here to be of service, and you, my dear friend, are in need of help. It's no coincidence, darling. It's fate! [drinks]
516008 [gulps] This Midsummer Theater Revival – what is it, exactly? [chews]
51620e An outdoor play held at the community park. Many moons ago, local theater troupes would perform, and ponies in the neighborhood would help make the costumes and design set pieces, prepare food to share during the performance.
516008 Y'all do look like you're enjoyin' each others' company. Kinda reminds me of Ponyville.
51600d It sounds lovely, darling.
51620e It was, up until several moons ago.
516008 What happened?
51620e That's Charity Kindheart. She was a well-known costume designer on Bridleway. She started the Midsummer Theater Revival as a way to share her passion for theater with the neighborhood. No matter how busy she was, she always made time for the Revival.
516000 [book shuts]
51620e But when she moved away to be closer to her grandfillies, the neighborhood lost the special tradition she had started, and worse, the sense of community it fostered.
5162dc Hey! I'm trottin’ here!
516008 Nopony else stepped up to take over for Charity?
51620e I've been trying to. But I've just gotten a last-minute request to alter costumes for the cast of My Fair Filly, and I'm afraid I haven't made much progress. Oh... There's just so much to do to bring back the Midsummer Revival, and my flyers haven't attracted a single volunteer!
51600d Say no more! You finish up your work, and by this time tomorrow, you'll be up to your mane in ponies who want to lend a hoof. Applejack and I will make sure of it!
51620e You will?
516008 You bet your boots we will!
51620e Oh, I don't wear boots. I find they chafe my calves when I walk.
516008 It's just an expression.
51600d So you see, the Method Mares are only available on this one day, and we need all the help we can get with preparation.
5162dd Yeah, not a good time right now. Heh. What am I saying? It's never a good time!
51600d [clearing throat] Well? What do you think?
5162de I got my own problems. You think I've got hours to dedicate to somepony else's?
5162df Ah, yes, Charity's Midsummer Theater Revival. Such wonderful memories.
516008 So you'll help us?
5162df Oh, [laughs], don't be ridiculous. I run a very important oat and hay import/export business. Why, I can't spare even a moment for such things!
516000 [splash]
516000 [ducks quacking]
51620e This is a nightmare.
51600d Oh, not at all, darling. It's quite lovely.
516008 I think she was talkin' about the Midsummer Theater Revival.
51620e I finished the alterations for My Fair Filly, but I've barely started the costumes for the Revival, and the Method Mares are coming to the park tomorrow for a costume fitting and rehearsal!
51600d Well, I could help you with the costumes.
51620e But what are we going to do about the rest? The park is in desperate need of repairs, and the sets still need to be built!
516008 Well I know a thing or two about buildin' and fixin' things. It's kinda, well, my thing. Could be the reason the map called me here!
51600d You see, dear? We went out looking for volunteers when all the help you need is right here.
516008 Uh-huh.
51600d The map wouldn't have chosen just Applejack and me if it was more than we could handle. Everything is going to be just fine!
51600d Perhaps I spoke too soon...
51620e Oh, dear, you're right. Are you sure you can manage this by yourself?
516008 Well, there's a lot to do, but Rarity's right. The map wouldn't have called us here if we weren't up for the challenge. You two go on and take care of the costumes. I'll see you at the dress rehearsal. [gulps]

516008 I know it looks bad, but I'm movin' as fast as I can.
516000 [splat]
516000 [clang]
51600d Don't worry, we've still got plenty of time. Everything's going to be—
5162e0 Um, excuse me? Is this where the Midsummer Theater Revival is supposed to be, perchance?
5162e1 We're here for the dress rehearsal?
51620e Oh, yes! We've just put the finishing touches on the costumes.
5162e2 [to Stardom] At least those look professional.
5162e1 We'll do a dry run of the play first, and then the fitting.
516008 No, wait! I haven't gotten a chance to—
516000 [wood crunching]
5162e1 [yelps]
516000 [crash]
516008 ...reinforce the stage yet.
51620e [sighs] I just wanted to live up to Charity's example, to bring my neighborhood together again. But the park is still a mess, we haven't even thought about what refreshments to serve during the performance, and even if we had, we don't have a stage for the Method Mares to perform on! It's hopeless... Just hopeless!
51600d [hushed] I don't understand. The map summoned us here to solve a friendship problem. We've clearly found it, but why did it send the two of us? Why not Twilight? I'm sure she could have used her magic to transform this park in an instant!
516008 I've been thinkin' the same thing. I mean, I can at least see why you're here – Coco's your friend, and you have an eye for costumes and all – but me? I was never gonna be able to finish a project this big.
51600d [dramatically] We'll return to Ponyville as failures! Why must this be, Applejack? Why? Why?! Wh—
516008 Now hold on there. I'm not suggestin' we pack up and go home.
51600d [muffled] Then what are you suggesting— [ptoo] Then what are you suggesting?
516008 I'm suggestin' we stop worryin' about what we can't do and start doing what we can. I think I've got a plan. It won't be anythin' big or fancy, but it'll be somethin'. And somethin's gotta be better than nothin', right?
51620e I suppose so...
516008 That's the spirit! Sorta...
516000 [hammering]
516008 Alright, y'all, it's ready!
5162e0 Should we go ahead and start?
516000 [curtains open]
5162e1 [as Charity Kindheart] Excuse me. I'm Charity Kindheart. I'm here about the open design position. I brought some samples of my work. I'm sorry I'm late. I had the hardest time finding my way here. [tearing up] I just moved here, and I keep getting mixed up by the street names! I had a map, but I dropped it in a puddle, which only made the street names harder to read!
5162e0 I see.
5162e3 What is that?
5162e4 I dunno, sugar, looks like some kinda play.
5162e3 Well, can we stay and watch it please? Please, can we, can we?
5162e4 Oh, alright, I suppose we could stay for a minute.
5162e2 Excuse me, but your next appointment is here.
5162e0 Alright. Send him in. [to Raspberry Beret] I'm sorry, but based on these samples, I just don't think this is the place for you.
5162e1 [gasps dramatically]
5162e0 Don't get me wrong. These clothes are all exquisite and well-made, but more theatrical than avant-garde. Have you considered costume design? I have a contact on Bridleway! If you're interested, I can put you in touch with him. ...And scene.
516000 [curtains close]
516000 [ponies muttering]
516000 [curtains open]
5162e5 Charity, dear, is that you?
5162e1 Hello, Mrs Pearblossom! I didn't see— oops!
5162e5 Oh, let me help you, dear. Are these the costumes you've been working on?
5162e1 Yes, I was supposed to be finished by now, but there's just so much to do, and I still have a few last-minute alterations to make before opening night! I'm sorry I couldn't get enough tickets for everypony in the neighborhood. I hope Mr Pearblossom wasn't too disappointed. I know Trotter on the Roof is one of his favorites.
5162e5 Oh, my dear filly, don't worry about that. We're so proud of you. We shall be with you in spirit!
5162e1 Thank you! You've all made me feel so welcome here and have become like family to me! I just wish I could share this experience with you and the others!
516115 Eh, what's goin' on?
5162e6 It's the Midsummer Theater Revival. The Method Mares are performing!
516115 [sighs] The Revival. Mhm, yeah. My pop used to bring me.
5162e5 So nice of you to put on this play for the neighborhood.
5162e1 I couldn't have done it without everypony's help! I know it's not Bridleway, but—
5162e5 Oh, pish-tosh! It's perfect, dear!
5162d8 [eating popcorn]
5162e7 Oh, you're such a dear, thank you! This is so nice. Haven't seen the neighborhood this friendly since Charity moved away!
516000 [audience clapping and cheering]
5162e0 Thank you, fillies and gentlecolts. Please give a warm welcome to the one who made this entire event possible – our neighbor Coco Pommel!
516000 [audience clapping and cheering]
51620e [clears throat] Thank you all so much for coming. The Midsummer Theater Revival was always something that meant so much to me, and it seems it means quite a lot to all of you as well. I really can't take all the credit, though. My dear friends Rarity and Applejack helped me ever so much.
516000 [audience clapping and cheering]
51600d Oh, darling, please, it was just a few costumes.
516008 Aw, shucks, I just happen to be good with a hammer is all. To be honest, we had much bigger plans to start. When those fell through, we decided to simplify. This here was the result.
51600d Oh, don't be so modest. Coco and I were lost.
51620e You bet your boots we were!
516000 [general chatter]
5162e8 We just wanted to say how much we enjoyed the Midsummer Theater Revival and how much it inspired us!
516008 Oh, yeah?
5162df I used to think that to help my community I had to do something big. Heh-heh. And let's face it – in this day and age, who has the time for such a commitment? But here, you did something as simple as building a stage and putting on a play and, heh, look at how it's brought everypony together.
5162e8 I saw Coco's flyers for volunteers but didn't think anything I'd have time to do would be that useful. Now I wish I'd offered to help, even if it was just pulling a few weeds or planting a few flowers.
516008 Not sure if you noticed, but the park is far from bein' fixed up. I imagine if you look around, you'll find there's lots of little ways for you to get involved in changin' this place for the better.
5162e8 And I will!
5162df And I don't think we'll be alone!
516000 [cutie marks ringing]
516008 Yee-hoo!
516043 [laughing]
516008 We did it!
51600d [gasps] I understand now! It all makes perfect sense!
516008 Huh?
516000 [thunk]
51600d I know why the map called you here.
516008 You do?
51600d If Twilight had used her magic to fix the park, it wouldn't have fixed the real problem, which is that these Manehattan ponies didn't think they had time to do something for their community! But by building that stage and making sure the play went on, you showed them that just by doing something small, you can make a big difference!
516008 Well, I'll be!
51600d Seems you have more in common with the Manehattan ponies than you thought!
516008 Heh-heh. But all the same, I'd sure like to head back to Ponyville on the next train. I want to check in with Apple Bloom and find out how the Sisterhooves Social turned out.
51600d Oh, absolutely, my dear. Just as soon as I stop that pony in the shop over there from purchasing that dreadfully hideous scarf! Stop! You're making a terrible mistake!
516008 [sighs]
516000 [Applejack's montage music over credits]
517009 Oh, snickerdoodle! Where is the darned thing? [groans] I wish for once I'd remembered to label these boxes! Uh, Big Mac, be a dear and help me move those... uh, maybe it's in that one on the bottom.
517000 [boxes creaking]
517000 [lid sliding]
517009 Oh, dagnabbit, it's not in there either!
51700a [muffled laughing] [normal] You can't catch me!
517008 [laughing] Woo-hoo!
51700a Hey!
517008 [more laughing] You trickster!
517009 Sisterhooves Social is right around the corner. Thought it'd be nice to award the winner of the big race the ribbon from when we hosted the very first Social! If'n of course I could find the darn thing. Oh, would you looky here! My, how Apple Bloom used to love watching you make that thing fly. It's like she thought you was magic. Ah, right, enough reminiscin'. Gotta find that ribbon! If you would just help me— [straining] pull... this... box, then maybe I can... uh, Big Mac?
517000 [thump]
517009 [straining] Found her!
517000 [theme song]
5170ff S-I-S-T-E-R-S! Which two sisters are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Applejack forever! Yee-hoo!
51700a We're gonna win every competition at the Sisterhooves Social! Those other fillies aren't gonna know what hit 'em!
517008 Oh. Hey there, Big Mac! Did you want somethin'?
517026 Eeyup.
51700a Hold that thought. Applejack, you are the most awesome sister ever!
517008 Aw, gee-whiz. [laughs] Well I think it's sweet that you hold that opinion, but—
51700a It's not opinion! It's objective fact! You saved Equestria like a gazillion times, you're smart, funny, strong... why, you're the best sister of all time! Probably the best Apple of all time! Right, Big Mac?
517026 Eeyup.
51700a And with you by my side, I am guaranteed to taste sweet, sweet Sisterhooves Social victory! Go, Apples, go, go, go, Apples go!
517008 Uh, Apple Bloom? I think Big Mac's got somethin' he wants to show you.
517000 [squeaking]
517000 [dragonfly toy spinning]
517000 [clicking]
51700a Oh, hey. Is that the toy we used to play with when I was little?
517026 Eeyup!
51700a Neat. [to Applejack] Alright then! Let's get back to practicin'! One more run-through of our jugglin' routine, make sure our harmonies are tight in our song, and see if we can't beat our best pie-eatin' time!
517008 Hold on, sugarcube. I need a minute to talk with Big Mac.
51700a Mind if I go ahead and start eatin' this pie?!
517000 [splat]
517000 [hammer clanging on anvil]
517008 Hey, Big Mac, you all right?
517026 [sighs] Yup.
517008 You sure? You seemed a little down back there.
517026 [scoffs] Nope.
517008 Come on, you can tell me. You feelin' a little left out? Apple Bloom and I have been spendin' a lot of time together gettin' ready for the Social.
517000 [cutie mark pulsing]
517008 [gasps] What in the...?
51700a Your cutie mark! You're being summoned, Applejack! This is so cool!
517026 [sighs] Eeyup.
51700a Wonder where you're bein' called to. Wonder what you're supposed to do when you get there. Obviously to somethin' awesome because you're awesome! But... but if you're bein' summoned to solve a friendship problem, that means you'll have to miss the Sisterhooves Social! And if you have to miss the Social, then I'll have to miss the Social, which means I won't be able to taste sweet, sweet victory! [hyperventilating]
517008 Now calm down. Let me just go over to Twilight's castle and see what's what! Maybe it's just a false alarm.
51700a But you said it was a false alarm!
517008 I said maybe it's a false alarm. Well, it's not. Rarity and I have to go to Manehattan.
51700a Can't you just tell that map it'll have to wait a couple days?
517008 No can do, sugarcube. When duty calls, I gotta answer right away. What kind of an example would I be settin' for my little sister if I didn't?
51700a This can't be happening! Your extreme awesomeness is backfiring on me!
517008 [sighs] I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. [to Big Mac] Try and cheer her up, won't you?
517026 Eeyup.
517000 [triangle rattling]
517009 Breakfast, come and get it!
517000 [splat]
517000 [plate rattling]
517009 Oh, it's no use, Big Mac. If I know my Apple Bloom, she won't come out of a funk this funky 'til her big sister gets back.
517000 [knocking]
517066 Hey, Apple Bloom, the Social's gonna start in a few hours. Thought you might want to go with us.
517065 Since Rarity and Applejack are out of town, you and Sweetie Belle can cheer on me and Rainbow Dash instead!
517066 Pretty great they're letting you participate even though you're not technically sisters.
517009 Well, the Social's always had a pretty loose definition of what consti-ma-tutes a sister. As long as you share a bond that represents the spirit of the Social, you're in!
517066 So what do you say?
517065 You coming?
51700a Why not, got nothin' better to do... lemme wash up and I'll meet you in a little bit.
517000 [thunk]
517009 [sighs] Such a shame we don't live closer to all your second cousins. You could maybe do the Social with one of them instead. What is it, Big Mac? Y'all got an idea?
517026 Eeyup!
51700a What? What is it?!
517065 Today is our big day!
51700c We have so got this. I'm gonna go sign us in.
517066 I guess I'm just a little jealous you two get to compete and I don't. But at least I get to be here and cheer you on! I thought Apple Bloom was gonna be here too.
517065 Guess she changed her mind. Hey, there you are! You ready to cheer on me and Rainbow Dash to victory?
51700a Uh, not exactly. Seems I'm gonna get to participate after all.
517066 [gasps] Applejack is back from Manehattan already? That must mean Rarity is back too!
51700a No, our sisters are still gone. But it, uh... turns out my long lost cousin... 'Orchard Blossom' was able to make it last minute. [nervous laugh]
517066 Your cousin who what now?
517026 [as Orchard Blossom, falsetto] Well, I do declare! It's hotter today than the business end of a corncob pipe! [giggling]
517026 Oh, my! I'm so delighted to meet your little friends, Apple Bloom. Would these be your dear and beloved Cutie Mark Crusaders?
51700a [sighs] Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, cousin Orchard Blossom.
517026 It is my extra-ordinary pleasure to make your acquaintance.
517066 [deadpan] That's Big Mac in a dress.
517026 Big Mac? Why, as charmed as I am that you find me in the slightest resemblance to such a-a-a fine and noble product of the Apple clan, I am astonished in equal measure. However, I shall take this startling observation under advisement given that it's from such an astute and perceptive filly as yourself, Sweetie Belle.
517066 That's awful nice of you to say, cousin Orchard Blossom! I've been told before I'm pretty observant.
517026 I haven't the slightest doubt.
517000 [scribbling]
517026 Pardon me. My dearest cousin Applejack is regrettably unable to be here as planned, so I, her cousin Orchard Blossom, will accompany Apple Bloom in her stead. I trust that's acceptable to all concerned?
51700c Cousin Orchard Blossom, huh? I know Applejack has a lot of relatives, but I feel like she would've mentioned you.
517026 Why, you must be Rainbow Dash. You're Scootaloo's... say... how are y'all related again?
51700c Hm. Why don't I just let you finish signing in? [hushed] But don't think me and Scootaloo are gonna take it easy on you just 'cause you're a stallion!
517026 [laughs] Now, where were we?
517000 [crunch, crunch]
51700a Um, excuse me. I have to... go to the bathroom. [zip]
517026 [tuts] You mean 'powder your muzzle', don't you, dear? Such a more, uh, feminine-like reference to nature's call, don't you agree?
517066 Have they called your brother's bluff yet?
51700a No, but they're about to! I can't bear to watch!
517026 Yoo-hoo! Apple Bloom! They've approved us as a pair! [giggles] Hurry along now, precious!
51700a I can't believe they bought it!
517066 It's sweet he wants to help you out like this. Weird, but sweet.
517000 [ponies singing]
5172e9 Bravo, bravo! Weren't those two sisters great? Now, where are our next competitors?
517026 Here we are! This one, please.
5172e9 Excellent choice... ma'am.
51700a [hushed] You sure you know all the words? 'Cause it took Applejack a pretty long time to get it down.
517026 [hushed] Did it now?
51700a [gulp]
517000 [Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh]
517000 We all love our brothers
517000 And our fathers and mothers
517000 We honor them like every family should
517000 But there's somethin' that's quite unique
517000 When my sister's there with me
517000 And we share that special bond of sisterhood
51700a [Apple Bloom]
51700a Sisterhood
517026 [Big McIntosh]
517026 Sisterhood
51700a [Apple Bloom]
51700a Is a special kind of friend
51700a Sisterhood
517026 [Big McIntosh]
517026 Sisterhood
51700a [Apple Bloom]
51700a Is a bond that never ends
517000 [Apple Bloom and Big McIntosh]
517000 It's not always perfect
517000 You might fight or be misunderstood
517000 But together you'll always have sisterhood
517026 [Big McIntosh]
517026 Sisterhood
51700a [Apple Bloom]
51700a Sisterhood
517026 [Big McIntosh]
517026 Sisterhood
51700a [Apple Bloom]
51700a Sisterhood
517026 [Big McIntosh]
517026 Sisterhood
51700a [Apple Bloom]
51700a Sisterhood
517026 [Big McIntosh]
517000 [deep bass] Sisterhood!
51700a [Apple Bloom]
517000 [joining in] ...ood
517000 [ponies chatter]
51700a [nervous laugh] Are you okay, cousin Orchard Blossom? You sounded like you were catchin' a cold or somethin' else that would make your voice sound totally different right at the end of the song. [nervous laugh]
517026 Just a frog in my throat, dear. Probably just need to get a sip of water. If you'll excuse us, we've another event in which to participate. Oh, my, that certainly didn't go as I had planned. But don't you worry. We'll get you a blue ribbon yet, Apple Bloom.
51700a You sure about that?
517026 As sure as my name is cousin Orchard Blossom.
51700a [to herself] But that isn't your name!
5172ea C-O-U-S-I-N-S! Which two sis— uh, cousins are the best? We are! Apple Bloom and Appleja— I mean, Orchardjack— Blossom forever!
517026 Whee!
51700a Whoaaa!
517000 [crash]
517000 [pop]
51700a [spits] Yay.
517000 [rope whooshing]
517000 [pins clunking]
517026 Oh, I don't know why I didn't choose to wear something more casual. Why, I knew that juggling routine like the back of my hoof! But never you mind. There is still the race to be run!
51700a I really appreciate all the effort, Big Ma— cousin Orchard Blossom, but maybe we just skip the whole obstacle course thing and call it a day.
517026 Why, Apple Bloom! I wouldn't hear of it! Your cousin Orchard Blossom may be many things, but she is not a quitter.
51700a I'm sure she's not, but it's like Applejack said! There'll be more Sisterhooves Socials down the line, and I'm sure she'll help me get a blue ribbon next time around.
517026 B-But you wanted to win it this Sisterhooves Social! And no matter what, I am gonna get you that win! Why, I simply have to.
51700c Alright, Scootaloo, remember the parts where teamwork really comes into play!
517065 How could I forget? We've been training all week!
51700c Okay, hot stuff! What's our move on the grape squish?
517065 The alley-oop.
51700c Apple toss?
517065 Flip-flop.
51700c Egg carrying?
517065 Flutter-bomb.
5172eb Yeah!
517026 Oh, dear.
517009 [through megaphone] Competi-sis-tors! Take your positions!
517026 [snorts]
517009 [through megaphone] And a-ready, and a-set, go!
51700c Nice jump, Scoot!
517026 [yelp]
517000 [crunching]
517000 [crash]
51700a Woo-hoo!
517000 [chewing]
517026 [belches]
517000 [snap]
517026 [chewing] [belches]
517000 [grapes squishing]
517000 [splash]
51700a Yikes! You almost squished me!
517000 [chickens panicking]
517026 Pick up those hooves, Apple Bloom! Why, you're barely movin' at a mosey!
517000 [crunch]
517026 Come on, junebug, it's... like you've never carried an egg before!
51700a Argh! I'm goin' as fast as I can!
517026 [anxious jittering]
51700a [yelps]
517000 [crunching]
517000 [ponies yelping]
51700a [screaming]
5172eb [yelps]
517026 Woo-hoo!
517000 [beat]
517026 [coughs] I mean, [clears throat] victory is ours, sweet Apple Bloom!
517000 [ripping]
517000 [thunk]
517026 Uh-oh.
5172ec "Uh-oh" indeed!
51700a I should've known you'd eventually get busted for bein' a stallion!
5172ec Oh, no, we've known all along. The Sisterhooves Social has always had a loose policy when it comes to what counts as a "sister". But we do have a strict policy when it comes to sportsponyship! In your "sister's" desperation to win, he used brute strength to physically take out the competitors. Uh, that kind of behavior is not just unbecoming of a lady, but quite frankly, of anypony! And for that, you two are hereby disqualified!
51700c Hah! Looks like we win, squirt!
517065 Woo-hoo! Yeah!
517000 [ponies cheering]
51700a I told you I should've just waited until the next Social to win with Applejack.
517026 [sighs]
517000 [balloon popping]
51700a You know I'm... not mad, right?
517026 Eeyup.
51700a I mean... let's face it – you dressin' up as my cousin Orchard Blossom was a pretty crazy idea in the first place.
517026 Eeyup.
51700a And it's not like you got me disqualified from the Social forever or anythin'. I can participate next time with Applejack. Everything's fine.
517026 Eeyup.
51700a I just don't understand why you went so crazy there at the end of the race. I mean, I know you like to win an' all, but... you wanna tell me what's goin' on?
517026 Nope.
51700a Alright. Well, it's getting late. You comin'?
517026 Nope.
51700a Okay. See you later, I guess...
517026 Apple Bloom?
51700a Yeah?
517026 When you were little, you used to look up to me, thought I was the best thing since zap apple jam. Things are different now. Applejack's the hero of the Apple family, always rushin' off to save Equestria. And I'm just here on the farm, doin' chores, helpin' out the way I can, nothin' special, nobody's hero. I guess I just thought... oh, never mind. Here I am about to start blabberin' on about my feelin's. You don't wanna hear all this.
51700a Yes, I do!
517026 I guess I just thought if I could... fill in for Applejack at the Social and get you a blue ribbon, well, I could be somepony you looked up to again. Be your hero again. Even if it was for just a day. It was foolish and I'm ashamed. Please, I just wanna be alone right now.
51700a Yeah, well, too bad, you big goof! 'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere. And I know that you're always gonna be here when I need you. Heck, you'll do a whole obstacle course in high heels if you think it'll help me get somethin' I want. You're my big brother. You've always been a hero to me, Big Mac, and you always will be. I'm real sorry I haven't been lettin' you know that's how I feel. Guess both of us have been holdin' back when it comes to expressin' ourselves, huh?
517026 Eeyup.
517009 Big Mac! Apple Bloom! Your sister's home! She says she's got quite a story to tell about her trip to Manehattan!
51700a Be there in a bit! I'm spending some quality time with my big brother! [to Big Mac] Hey, Big Mac?
517026 Eeyup?
51700a How do you think cousin Orchard Blossom would describe this sunset?
517026 [chuckles] Why, dear, I do declare this is the most beautiful sunset my eyes have ever looked upon. Though sitting here on these tree roots is a trifle uncomfortable for my hindquarters.
5172ea [laughing]
517000 [credits]
51800a Okay, Crusaders! Back to the business of earnin' our cutie marks! Any suggestions?
518065 No, we've tried everything!
518066 We've run out of ideas.
51800a Are you kiddin' me, Crusaders? We can do better than that!
51800a [Apple Bloom]
51800a We've been searchin' for our cutie marks
51800a For a while now
51800a Tryin' to find out how we fit in
51800a So many ways we've tried before
51800a But we keep on tryin' more
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in
518080 We'll make our mark
518080 One way or another
518080 We'll make our mark
518080 On the day that we discover
518080 The ultimate reward of our cutie marks!
51800a Now, that's more like it!
5180f2 Cutie Mark Crusaders! Help!
51800a What's wrong, Pipsqueak?
5180f2 I'm running for student pony president, I was hoping you three would be my campaign managers!
51800a We've never tried gettin' our cutie marks in campaign managin'! What do ya say, Crusaders?
518080 Yeah! Hoof!
518000 [theme song]
51800a [loudly] So, Pip, how would you help the school if you were elected student pony president?
5180f2 Our playground equipment took quite a beating during Twilight's battle with Tirek!
518000 [snap, thump]
5180f2 If I'm voted in as student pony president, I'll go to the school board and right this wrong!
518000 [foals cheering]
51805c Well, I think that's a ridiculous waste of money! It's just like when Twist proposed to repair the window that Discord destroyed! She just wanted to repair it like a plain old schoolhouse window. But you all know voting for me was the best choice because I convinced the school board to give that window visual appeal!
51800a 'Course, it doesn't hurt that her mother Spoiled Rich is president of the school board.
51805f Exactly! Which is why when Diamond Tiara is voted student pony president, the school will be putting a statue of her in the center of our schoolyard!
51805c [through gritted teeth] Silver Spoon! That was my big announcement for when I won!
51805f I was only trying to help.
51805c [through gritted teeth] I don't need that kind of help!
51800a Haven't we all had enough of Diamond Tiara?
518065 Do we really need a big statue of her?
518066 Especially where our playground equipment should be?
518000 [foals shocked whispering]
5180f2 A vote for Pip is a vote for the playground!
51805c A vote for Diamond Tiara is a vote for more Diamond Tiara!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 It's time to make a change
518080 This is our chance
518080 Don't be afraid to do what's right
518080 He's it! Vote for Pip!
518080 We got an opportunity
518080 To have fun again
518080 A vote for Pip, and you can join the fight
518080 It's time for a new leader
518080 It's time to make a change
518080 We're here to fight for what we believe
518080 (Vote for Pip!)
518080 It's finally time we beat her
518080 And play a better game
518080 'Cause when we vote together
518080 There's nothing that we can't achieve
51805c [Diamond Tiara]
51805c I don't believe what I am hearing
51805c I'm the only one you should be cheering
51805c Pipsqueak? Try "Pip's weak!" Don't you think?
51805c But a diamond is perfection
51805c It's natural selection
51805c So your vote better be for me, not the weakest link
51800a We'll let the votin' decide!
51805c [Diamond Tiara]
51805c Everypony has their little secrets
51805c I know you do
51805c A vote for me will help you keep them safe
51805c Like your creepy super strength!
51805c Or your mane extension
51805c A little thing I won't mention
51805c Or those freakish large teeth in your face!
51800a Come on now, ponies! Don't listen to her!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 You've gotta vote for change
518080 It's time for a new leader
518080 End all the tyranny
518080 Vote now and we can beat her
518080 It's now another day
518080 And we believe in what's right
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 Vote for Pip! Vote for Pip!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 Our victory is in sight
51805c Stop! Everypony who hasn't voted, listen up!
51805c Pip makes promises he can't keep
51805c But I can do more
51805c You could really use a new bookbag
51805c 'Cause I'll make things happen
51805c That none of you here can afford
51805c To do, like, ever!
51805c Wouldn't you like a little something sweet?
51805c Here's a parasol to hide you from the heat
51805c Who says that I can't be nice?
51805c But first there's one thing
51805c An itsy-bitsy little string
51805c And voting for me is the price!
51805f [Silver Spoon]
51805f I've a tiny suggestion
51805f That you should be aware
51805f You could probably win this election
51805f If you show them all you real—
51805c I don't recall asking you to speak!
51804d [gasps]
518066 Well, if that's how you treat your best friend, then I choose Pipsqueak!
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 Vote!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 Stand strong and don't be afraid, ponies
518080 Let's free ourselves from the past
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 For Pip!
5180f3 Vote!
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 He's it! Vote for Pip! Vote!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 We'll let honor win out against the tyranny
518080 And make a change that will last
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 For Pip!
5180f3 Vote!
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 Vote for Pip!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 It's time for a new leader
518080 It's time to make a change
518080 We're here to fight for what we believe
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 Vote for Pip!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 It's finally time we beat her
518080 And play a better game
518080 'Cause when we vote together
518080 There's nothing that we can't achieve
5180f3 [Foals]
5180f3 Vote for Pip!
51805b The votes have been counted! The student pony president is... Pipsqueak!
51805c Huh?!
518000 [foals cheering]
51800a Oh, my gosh, Crusaders! Pip won!
5180f2 I couldn't have won without the hard work of my campaign managers, the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
518066 Campaign manager cutie marks!
51805c Guess you're not as good as you thought, blank flanks! In fact, I demand a recount!
51805b Trust me, Diamond Tiara. Pip won.
51805c I'll be the judge of that, Miss Cheerilee!
518000 [beat]
51805c What?! One vote! Silver Spoon! You didn't vote for me?!
51805f No, I didn't.
51805c But you're my best friend!
51805f Am I? 'Cause I tried to help by mentioning your 'surprise' statue, and suddenly I wasn't even allowed to speak! You could have actually won this election if you just listened to me. You wanna know how? [whispering] Sorry. I'm not allowed to speak.
51805c [screams in rage]
51805f [to Cutie Mark Crusaders and Pipsqueak] What? I don't have to follow her drama any more.
51800a I know Diamond Tiara's been pretty awful, but... we should probably make sure she's okay. Just 'cause she's never cared about anypony else's feelings doesn't mean we shouldn't care about hers.
518000 [door opens]
5182ed Diamond Tiara! Why are you making that face? That is not the face of a winner.
51805c Because... I didn't win.
5182ed What?! You mean I hefted all these party supplies to celebrate nothing?!
518000 [thump]
51805c Sorry, mother.
5182ed It's bad enough you lost to that transplant from Trottingham, but imagine if you'd lost to one of those blank flanks. As a Rich pony, you must always think of your social standing.
518122 Hm.
5182ed That starts here in Ponyville and reaches all over Equestria. Don't ever forget that, Diamond Tiara. Ever!
51805c [Diamond Tiara]
51805c If I'm a diamond
51805c Then why do I feel so rough?
51805c I'm as strong as a stone
51805c Even that's not enough
51805c There's something jagged in me
51805c And I've made such mistakes
51805c I thought that diamonds were hard
51805c Though I feel I could break
51805c Would you believe
51805c That I've always wished I could be somepony else?
51805c Yet I can't see
51805c What I need to do to be the pony I want to be
51805c I've been told my whole life
51805c What to do, what to say
51805c Nopony showed me that
51805c There might be some better way
51805c And now I feel like I'm lost
51805c I don't know what to do
51805c The ground is sinking away
51805c I'm about to fall through
51805c Would you believe
51805c That I've always wished I could be somepony else?
51805c Yet I can't see
51805c What I need to do to be the pony I want to be
51805c To be the pony I want to be
518066 Is it weird that I feel bad for her?
518065 If it is, then... I'm weird, too.
51800a She wants to change, but she doesn't know how.
518066 Seems like she could use a friend or two to help her figure it out.
518000 [bell ringing]
518000 [foals chattering]
51800a Hey, Diamond Tiara! Wait up!
51805c What do you three want? To gloat? Rub in my defeat?
51800a Actually, we wanted to invite you to our clubhouse to hang out.
51805c Really?
518065 Yeah, for real!
51805c Well, thanks to you all, I don't have any important class president business to attend to or anything. So I might as well.
518066 That sounds like a yes...
51805c So, do you three just sit around here plotting out different ways to try and get your cutie marks?
51800a Actually, yeah.
51805c You three are... really lucky.
518080 We are?!
51805c Yeah! You get to explore all these options, learning who you really are before you're stuck with something you don't understand.
51800a But... you've done that, right?
51805c Yeah, 'cause I have my cutie mark! And I'm not struggling at all to figure out who I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing with this mark that's already on my flank!
51800a Uh... are you sure about that?
51805c [scoffs] That's a weird question.
518066 Not really, since we kind of overheard you yesterday.
51805c Were you trying to get your cutie mark in spying? Is that on your little chart?
518066 No! We were just worried about you when you lost the election, and then you lost your friend, and then your mom yelled at you...
51800a We know you wanna change, and we think we can—
5180f2 [muffled] Help!
518000 [door opens]
5180f2 Cutie Mark Crusaders! I was at the school board meeting and they didn't approve my request for the new playground equipment!
518066 Why not?
5180f2 There's no money in the budget! So I checked my Peggy bank to see if I had enough bits, but my little Peggy wasn't nearly full enough!
518066 Don't worry, Pip!
518065 We'll meet you back at school.
51800a And help you find a solution!
5180f2 Thanks, Cutie Mark Crusaders!
51805c Oh, I already have a solution! Our new student pony president is gonna be kicked out of office, and I'll be reinstated!
518065 Where's she going?
51800a Where do you think?! C'mon! After her!
518066 Wait! I'm coming too!
51805c [Diamond Tiara]
51805c Cutie Mark Crusaders, get out of my way
51805c Those ponies need to know the truth
51805c And they'll hear it from me
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 Stop! Diamond Tiara, this is not the way
518080 You know you're better than this hostility
51805c [Diamond Tiara]
51805c You don't even know me at all
51805c Don't understand the meaning of my fall
51805c What my family would think if I ever
51805c Fail at anything
51805c I'm a diamond – that means you'll never break
51805c No matter what be the cost of the path I take
51805c Whatever I have to do to win in the end
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 Stop! This is not the answer
518080 Wait! And it's plainly seen
518080 Listen! You can redeem yourself
518080 But by helping others, not by being mean
518080 We know you want friends who admire you
518080 You want to be the star with all the power too
518080 But there's a better way, there's a better wa-a-ay
518080 There's so much more still left to
518080 Learn about yourself
518080 See the light that shines in you
518080 We know you can be somepony else
518080 You can stop right now
518080 And try another start
518080 You'll finally free yourself from the dark
518080 And see the light
518080 And see the light of your cutie mark
51805c Everypony, I have an announcement!
51800a Diamond Tiara! Think hard about the choice you're makin' right now!
518065 You can be a better pony!
518000 [door opens]
5182ed Diamond Tiara! I just happened to be here for the school board meeting, and this is what I see when we adjourn? My daughter associating with confused, insignificant lowlifes? Socializing with their kind is not how you move up in Equestria! Come, Diamond Tiara!
51805c No, mother!
5182ed Excuse me?!
51805c You've spent your life acting like a high horse and raised me to follow in your hoofprints! At first I thought this was fine, but then I finally realized I wanted something you don't have – friends!
518080 [gasps]
5182ee [gasps]
5182ed That's enough, Diamond Tiara! Step away from those blank flanks!
51805c These are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, and they are my friends! You need to stop calling them such mean and hurtful names! They are working harder to get their cutie marks than anypony I've ever seen! And they will get them exactly when they discover their true talent, which I guarantee will be amazing! Now, will you please deliver this to father?
5182ed Yes, of course, dear...
51805c I have to thank you, Crusaders. Obviously, I've known since I got my cutie mark that my talent is getting other ponies to do what I want. I just asked my father if he could donate the money for the new playground equipment!
518000 [foals chattering]
51805c [to Pipsqueak] I knew you were worried for a second there, weren't you? Ha! Well, I think it's all gonna work out just fine, Mister President!
51805c [Diamond Tiara]
51805c We'll build a playground
51805c For all of us to enjoy
51805c So full of games
51805c There's enough for each girl and boy
51805c I want to help and do
51805c Everything that I can
51805c I'm here to show you I changed
51805c Listen up, here's the plan
51805c Bring it in! That's right, keep it coming! Hey there, you with the amazing strength. Can you help them move that merry-go-round across the lawn? Thank you so much! And you with the super teeth, we need you to help with that teeter-totter. You got it! That's the spirit!
51805c There's so much I can do
51805c To help everypony else
51805c I see the light that shines in me
51805c I know I can be my better self
51805c I can free the past
51805c 'Cause now the future's bright for me
51805c My cutie mark has set me free
51805c To do what's right and be the pony I want to be
51805c And be the pony I want to be!
51800a I've been thinkin', Crusaders. We spend an awful lot of time fussin' and frettin' tryin' to discover our true talent. But when we take a little time off, we end up helpin' other ponies figure out their true talent!
518066 Yeah, and I think that's way more important than worrying about our cutie marks, don't you?
518065 Absolutely! I don't care if I ever get my cutie mark as long as I get to hang out with my best friends.
51800a So what do you say, Crusaders? Want to just focus on helpin' others find their cutie marks?
518105 Yeah!
518000 [magic zaps]
518000 [foals gasping]
518066 What happened?
51800a What's goin' on?
51805c It's your cutie marks! They're amazing!
518080 We all got the same cutie mark! Cutie Mark Crusaders forever!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 We were searching for our cutie marks
518080 For a while there
518080 Trying to find out how we fit in
518080 So many ways we've tried before
518080 But we kept on trying more
518080 'Cause the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't give in
518065 [Scootaloo]
518065 Now we know what it took all along
518066 [Sweetie Belle]
518066 And our journey here is never really done
51800a [Apple Bloom]
51800a For it is more than just a mark
51800a It's a place for us to start
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 An adventure that has only just begun
518080 We'll make our mark
518080 Show the world what we can do
518080 We'll make our mark
518080 Helping fillies to break through
518080 To the ultimate reward of a cutie mark
518007 All right, everypony! Get ready for the biggest cute-ceañera celebration ever!
518000 [ponies cheering]
518008 Oh, sugarcube, if Mom and Dad were here, they'd be so proud of ya.
51800a Oh... Thanks, Applejack.
518008 Now go on and party with your pals.
51800c [Rainbow Dash]
51800c I'm so proud of you, little buddy
51800c You've taught me a thing or two
51800d [Rarity]
51800d You've inspired everypony around you
51800d And you've inspired me too
518000 [Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Applejack]
518000 You've made your mark
518000 Done Equestria so proud
518000 You've made your mark
518000 And we're here to sing it loud
518000 For the ultimate reward of your cutie mark
51800a Well, what do you think, Crusaders? Were these cutie marks totally worth waiting for or what?
518066 Yeah! I can't wait to see who we're gonna help next!
518080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
518080 We started out just three
518080 Crusaders driven to see
518080 What we find in our hearts
518080 Discover our destiny
518080 And here we are, best friends
518080 About to start it again
518080 An adventure that never will end
518080 We'll make our mark
518080 Helping fillies most in need
518080 We'll make our mark
518080 So each one of them succeeds
518080 'Cause the ultimate reward is a cutie mark!
518000 [credits]
519007 Five hundred and sixty-six, five hundred and sixty-seven, five hundred and sixty-eight... phew! Look at that, Pound Cake! I am so close to breaking my personal cupcake-icing record!
51902a My goodness! I can't believe what I'm seeing here!
519007 Pretty impressive if I do say so myself.
51902a Pinkie, would you mind watching the counter while I pop to the supply room? We've just received a very special order, and the ingredients need to be perfect.
51913b [squeals]
519007 Okie-dokie-lokie.
51902a Thanks, dear!
519000 [zip]
519000 [thud]
519007 A baby?! Shining Armor and Princess Cadance are having a baby?! [squeals] This is the best news ever! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
51902a Oh, em, Pinkie, uh... [whispers] it's a top secret surprise.
5192ef [prolonged shushing]
519000 [door closes]
519007 A top secret surprise?! That means I have to keep the exciting news... [gulps] ...to myself!
519000 [theme song]
519007 Even though I didn't technically make a Pinkie Promise to Mrs Cake, I can't tell Twilight or anypony the big news! That would make me a... a... a big old surprise ruiner! Right, Gummy?
5190c6 [sucking on pacifier]
519007 Did you take that from Pound Cake again? Don't you know it's wrong to steal from a baby?
51900d What's all this about a baby?
519007 What? Who? What? Who said something about a baby?!
51900d You did, Ms. Pie, just now. What were you talking about?
519000 [pop]
519007 [sucking on pacifier]
519003 Great! Everypony's here. Now I don't have to wait any longer to tell you all the wonderful news! Somepony special is coming to visit Ponyville, and I need your help getting everything ready!
519000 [Mane Six chattering]
519003 It's...
519054 Shining Armor and Princess Cadance!
519000 [beat]
519003 Yes, and they're coming—
519054 Tomorrow!
519000 [beat]
519003 Yes, on the—
519007 Friendship Express rather than the Crystal Empire train so as not to cause too much of a scene when they skip town to come visit? [squee]
519003 Yes.
519007 Annnnnd?
519003 And that's it.
519007 Oh.
51900c Uh, how did you know all that?
519007 [nervous laugh] Uh... Pinkie Sense?
519000 [stretching noise]
51900c So, you said you needed our help with something?
519003 Follow me.
51900c Sweet posters! Is that Smash Fortune?
519003 It sure is! When Shining Armor said he wanted to come to the castle and visit, I started collecting things he liked when he was a colt as a surprise!
519007 Surprise?! [nervous laugh]
519003 I've been so excited that it's been hard to keep it to myself!
519007 [slightly muffled] I have no idea what that's like!
51900e Aww, look at the cute little ant farm!
519000 [ant screeches]
519005 And check out all these old comic books!
519003 Be careful! They're mint-in-bag!
519005 [blowing] [nervous whistling]
519007 What's this?
519003 This is Brutus Force. Shining Armor used to carry him around like his baby!
519007 Yeah! [nervous laugh] Really cute! [nervous laugh]
51900d It is a bit juvenile for castle décor, but it is very sweet of you.
51900e I'm sure Shining Armor will love it.
519003 Me, too. But there's a few more things I'd like to add before he gets here, and I could really use a hoof collecting them.
519008 Whatever you need, sugarcube, we'll help you get it.
51901f [various agreements]
519003 Thanks, everypony! I just can't wait 'til they walk in and see everything!
51900c Totally understandable. Watching somepony else be surprised with something is almost better than being the one who's getting the surprise!
519007 But... eh... what if the surprise is something so incredibly exciting that a pony can't keep it in any longer, and she has to tell the pony standing next to her what it is or she might explode?!
51900e I would say... no.
51900d The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
519007 [nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!
519000 [pinball noises]
519000 [crash]
51900c So, I know the bar is set pretty high, but does anypony else think Pinkie Pie was acting weirder than usual?
519000 [zoom]
519000 [door shuts]
519007 [heavy breathing] Phew, that was close! Too close. I almost spilled the beans. Beans that would be really hard to clean up! I obviously can't be around my friends right now. Or anypony for that matter! Hmmm... That's it! If Shining Armor and Cadance are coming tomorrow, then all I have to do is lock myself in my room away from everypony until they arrive! Then I won't ruin anything!
51902b Oh, good, you're back! Mrs Cake needs my help, but these deliveries can't wait! I can't thank you enough for agreeing to be my backup delivery pony, Pinkie!
519007 I... did?
51902b Maybe I should hire somepony to be my backup delivery pony.
519007 I'll do it!
51902b Really?
519007 Sure! There's no possible way that I could ever have anything that might interfere with doing that task, like a gigantic, emotionally exhausting surprise that would make it super hard to be around other ponies.
51902b Great! Uh, you're sure you won't change your mind?
519007 No way! Cross my heart and hope to fly, stick a cupcake in my eye!
519007 Oh, yeah. I Pinkie Promised I'd do it. And I never break a Pinkie Promise! Never!
51902b Well, thanks again! You're a real cake-saver!
519007 [deflates, sighs] Hm. Maybe it'll be a quiet day and I can just avoid everypony!
519000 [cart squeaking]
51900a Hiya, Pinkie Pie!
519066 Heard any good gossip today?
519065 Yeah, we're bored. Please say you have some interesting news.
519007 Nope!
519000 [thump]
519007 Ugh! Fluttershy, what a surprise! I mean, not a surprise! [squee]
51900e You were in such a rush earlier. Twilight wanted me to ask you if you would bring some snacks to the castle for Shining Armor and Cadance's visit.
519007 Definitely! Got it! Pinkie Promise! Yeah! Heh.
51900e You know, maybe some baby carrots...
519007 [nervous laugh] What did you say?!
51900e Baby carrots! They're Shining Armor's favorite.
519007 Mine too! Baby carrots are kinda like big carrots but smaller, kinda like how foals are tiny versions of their parents but smaller and cuter and— Albino squirrel!
51900e Where? Is it Albert?
519007 It's time to kick this operation into hyper-hoof and avoid all ponies by any means necessary!
519000 [cart squeaking]
519000 [knocking]
519000 [door opens]
519000 [zoom]
519000 [sewing machine clicking]
519007 It didn't feel good ignoring my friends like that... Maybe I can tell just one little pony the surprise?
51900d [flashback] The pony who ruins a surprise for somepony else has to live with that guilt forever!
519007 You're right, spooky-reflection-of-Rarity-that-I-know-is-actually-my-own-imagination. I can't tell anypony at all! [sighs] Then they would tell Twilight, and she wouldn't be surprised, and it would be all my fault.
519007 [sighs] Finally, I'm all aloney on my owney.
519000 [paper rustling]
519007 Wow, great idea! I'm starving too! [chewing] [with mouth full] This apple is delicious! [swallows] What are you having, Gummy? Oh, no! It's the list that Twilight helped me make yesterday so I wouldn't forget all of my Pinkie Promises today! And I have three more things to do! Aw, four if you count bringing those snacks to Twilight's castle! I've been getting liberal with those Pinkie Promises lately...
519000 [balloons squeaking]
519066 Ooh! I want a flamingo!
519000 [balloons squeaking]
51900a I want a goldfish!
519000 [balloons squeaking]
519065 Surprise me!
519000 [balloons squeaking]
519000 [baby crying]
519065 Is that a... baby bottle?
519007 [screams] No! It's a... a... puppy! Ha ha, woof woof, ha ha! Eh...
519065 Are you sure? Because it looks like a—
519007 Next!
5192f0 Uh, a baby pony, please! Uh, unless of course that would be a royal pain...
519007 Interesting choice of words, Featherweight.
5192f0 Was it?
519007 I don't know. Was it?
5192f0 Uh, maybe you'd better just make me a giraffe.
519000 [filing cabinets closing]
519010 My, your friends weren't kidding when they said you had a great filing system, Pinkie! You are Ponyville's best kept secret!
519007 No, I'm not!
519010 [hushed] Speaking of secrets, have you ever known somepony else's secret?
519000 [papers rustling]
519007 Noooooo...
519010 [hushed] A surprise that was so big and exciting that it was all you could think about?
519007 Nope!
519010 [strangled sigh] Me neither...
519000 [balloon inflating]
5192f1 [laughing] That's just what I wanted. Thanks, Pinkie!
519007 You're welcome!
5192f1 Oh, by the way, can you help spread the word about the big crib sale I'm having?
519007 [reading] "Treat your foal like... royalty"?!
519000 [thump]
5192f1 [laughing] Pretty good slogan, huh? I came up with it all by myself!
519007 [screaming]
5192f1 Oh. I thought it was clever.
519000 [balloon deflates]
519003 Those look yummy, Pinkie! Let me help you! But we better cover them up so they don't get spoiled.
519007 Why would they get spoiled? We're all gonna eat them super soon!
519008 Oh, didn't anypony tell you? Shining Armor and Cadance are held up. They may not arrive 'til Saturday.
519007 Whaaaaaaaaaat?! [hyperventilating] You mean... [breathes] I have... [breathes] to wait... [breathes] another whole day?! I don't know if I can!
519003 Pinkie Pie, do you have something you need to say? You seem like you've been keeping something in.
519007 [inarticulate yell]
51900e We're here to listen.
519008 Well, go on then, sugarcube.
51900d We're not going to judge you, darling.
519005 You'll feel so much better once you get it off your chest!
519007 [breathing heavily into balloon]
51900c Come on.
519000 [balloon pops]
51900c Whatever it is, you can tell us! We're best friends! [with reverb] Friends! Friends! Friends!
519003 [with reverb] Tell!
51901b [with reverb] Tell! Tell!
5190d4 Friends! Friends! Friends! Tell! Tell! Tell!
519007 Okay, okay, you win! [inhales] Shining Armor and Cadance are gonna have a—
519193 An awesome weekend with the best little sister in all of Equestria!
519198 [giggles] Hi, everypony.
519007 [exhales]
519003 Shining Armor, Cadance! You're early! I thought something had come up and you weren't gonna make it until Saturday!
519198 So did we. Turned out we weren't needed in Maretonia until next week. And the summit we were supposed to attend today had to be rescheduled, so... we got here even sooner than planned!
519193 Surprise!
519198 It's wonderful to see you all again!
519013 [chattering]
519008 Well, the pleasure's all ours, Princess.
519003 I'm so glad you're here! I have a big surprise for you!
519193 Oh, yeah?
5192f2 [chattering]
519193 [hushed] Lucky we came when we did, huh? I'm guessing you saw the scroll we sent to Mr and Mrs Cake? Hey, I'm impressed you've been able to keep our secret this long!
519007 So you're gonna tell Twilight now?!
519000 [honk]
5192f2 [chattering]
519193 [hushed] You're gonna have to wait just a little bit longer. We have something special planned. It'll be worth it, I promise.
519007 It'd better be.
519008 So, do you think Shining Armor liked his surprise?
519003 Didn't you see him? He couldn't stop raving about it!
519193 [excited horse noises]
51900c Where did Shining Armor and Cadance say they'd meet us? [stomach rumbling] I'm starving!
519003 In the town square. I wish they'd waited to walk over with us, but they said they had something to take care of first!
519007 [through gritted teeth] They're gonna have a lot more to take care of soon...
519003 What?
519007 Nothiiiiiiing!
519000 [zoom]
519003 That's odd. Usually they're quite punctual.
51900c Ughhh! I need a hayburger in my belly right now!
519003 What's this? [gasps]
51900d What does it say?
519003 A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor used to set these up for me when I was a filly! At the end, there was always a big prize, like a new book, or several new books, or—
519007 We get the picture! You like books!
519008 So what's the first clue?
51900c I hope it's something about eating lunch!
519007 [reading quickly] "You've got a scroll, you're on a roll, why don't you take a peek where young ones spend their week? A piece of paper will continue this caper."
519003 I've got it! "Where the young ones spend their week."
519008 I'm not quite followin'.
519000 [school bell ringing]
519003 It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!
519007 Good enough for me! Now where's the next clue? [panting like a dog] [sniffing] [sneezes]
5192f0 Extra, extra! Get your Ponyville news! Read it in the paper! Extra, extra! [continues repeating under]
519003 "A piece of paper will continue this caper." [gasps] It's in the Foal Free Press!
519000 [paper rustling]
51900d Ooh, look at that dress Mayor Mare is wearing in the social report! Why, it's stunning!
519008 Uh, didn't you make that, Rarity?
51900d Yes, what is your point?
519007 Focus, everypony!
519003 You know, there's really no time limit on these scavenger hunts, Pinkie.
519007 Aha! There! [tapping paper]
519003 [reading] "Though this hall is rather small, in it you'll find files of all kinds. Take a look on the back of the birth certificate of Applejack."
519008 I don't like where this is goin'.
519000 [zoom]
519000 [knee-knocking noises]
519010 Baby! A royal ba—!
519007 A-hem?
519003 Does anypony know where the birth certificates are kept?
519007 Ooh! I do, I do! Go down that hall, then you take a left, then a right, then another right, then a slight left, and it's the third door from the right!
51900e Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you knew so much about town hall.
519007 There's a lot of things I know! That you don't know I know!
519000 [folders rustling]
51900e Oh, you're so cute.
519084 [giggling]
519003 [reading] "This next place is where you can buy a table or chair, or some comfy beds to rest little heads"?
519000 [zip]
519000 [beat]
519007 Ugh, really? None of you? [groan] It's obviously the furniture store! Go in, go in, go in!
519003 I don't know...
519007 Daagh, fine!
519000 [rumbling and commotion]
519000 [crash]
51900c Wow, you're scary good at this, Pinkie Pie.
519007 [reading quickly] "It seems we've saved the best for last. We hope that you have had a blast. Now it's time to take a break where you can get a slice of cake!"
5190d4 Sugarcube Corner!
519007 [scoffs] That was an easy one.
519000 [door opens, bell rings]
519193 Surprise! Twily, did you like the scavenger hunt?
519003 It was perfect! Just like old times, except even better because this time I got to share it with my best friends! There's just one thing missing, isn't there?
519193 What's that?
519003 Mmmm, the book prize at the end!
519193 [laughs] There's still a prize, but it's a little different this time.
519003 Oh. I don't understand.
519007 [giggles quietly]
519198 All the places we sent you today had something in common.
519003 First we went to the schoolhouse...
519007 [trembling]
519003 And then we read the Foal Free Press... After that we found Applejack's birth certificate... And then the last clue was under a crib.
51913c [giggling]
519003 Hmmm... School... foal... birth certificate... and crib... [gasps] Can it be? Are you two...?!
5191a5 We're having a baby!
519007 A baby, Twilight! It's a baby! Woo-hoo!
519003 You mean... I'm going to be an aunt?! This is the best prize ever!
5191a5 [laughing]
519003 Oh, I love you guys! And I can't wait to meet your little foal!
519193 Neither can we.
519000 [chattering]
519007 I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it! [squee] [pop] Go, Pinkie.
519000 [chattering]
519198 [giggles] You did it, Pinkie Pie! You kept it a surprise! Thank you! Was it much trouble?
519007 Piece of cake! [squee]
519000 [credits]
520000 [rustling]
520007 Happy Hearth's Warming Eve!
520000 [thud]
520049 [laughing]
520008 Shucks, Twilight! Y'all done it up nice and cozy in here.
520003 We're about to hang our Hearth's Warming dolls if you wanna join us.
520008 Oh, that's mighty sweet of you, but we're just stoppin' in to wish y'all a happy Hearth's Warmin' before we go.
520003 I think it's sweet that your families are spending the holiday together.
520007 Picture the most fun-tacular thing you can think of. Now multiply that times infinity! Whoo! It's gonna be great!
520000 [train whistle blowing]
520008 That's us. See you later!
520005 Now can we open presents?
520008 But tonight is Hearth's Warming Eve. Everypony knows you don't open presents 'til tomorrow.
520003 When Spike and I spent our first Hearth's Warming Eve together, he couldn't wait all night to open his presents! Ever since then, we've always opened them the night before!
520005 It's kinda like our tradition!
520008 That's not how our family does it, and I reckon it can't be how Pinkie's does it. Is it?
520007 No sirree!
520003 To each their own, I suppose.
520000 [train whistle blowing]
520007 Agh! Gotta go, bye!
520005 [straining]
520000 [paper tearing]
520005 Just what I always wanted! A book...
520000 [theme song]
520000 [train engine noises]
5202f3 Chancellor Puddinghead puddings! How 'bout a Windigo-frosted snow cone?
520008 It's so excitin'! Related or not, it's gonna be a hoot havin' our families together under one roof!
520007 Apples and Pies together again for the first time! Maybe. Unless we're related! Which maybe we're not. I think I just confused myself.
520008 Friends or family, this here's about togetherness.
52000a [mouth full] Have you tried the Equestria flag crepes? The blue is blueberry! And don't tell Granny I saw, but her trunk is full of presents!
520008 Now hang on, sugarcube. You know Hearth's Warmin' isn't just about candy and presents, right?
52000a Uh-oh. That's your boring sisterly lecture voice.
520009 [snoring in background]
520008 'Fraid so! [clears throat] A long time ago, the Earth ponies, Pegasus ponies, and unicorn ponies weren't friends.
520007 [as unicorn pony] I don't like you! [as Pegasus pony] I don't like you either!
520008 But then, the icy chill of the Windigos almost iced up everythin'. So the ponies decided to work together, and their friendship drove them nasty critters away.
520007 [as Pegasus pony] Beat it, Windigos!
520008 Triumphant, they raised a new flag to celebrate all three tribes, and Equestria was born.
520000 [biting sound]
520008 Uh, what happened to the flag?
520007 [chewing, with mouth full] I don't know... [swallows, licks]
52000a Is that why we celebrate with a flag raisin' tomorrow?
520008 Mm-hmm! And tonight, we'll have the traditional Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner to remember the shared bounties of our ancestors.
520007 We do that too!
520008 Then we'll hang our Hearth's Warmin' dolls over the fireplace to remind us of the warmth shared on that fateful night.
520007 That's what our family does too!
520008 And tomorrow, we open presents!
520007 Ah! We do that too!
52000a Sounds like the Apples and the Pies do everything the same way!
520211 [simultaneously] Of course! We might be related! Hey, I was gonna say that! Stop sayin' what I'm sayin'! You stop it first! [beat] [laughing]
520000 [train whistle blows]
520000 [train braking]
520000 [train whistle blows]
520007 I'm so happy, I need to make up a new word for how happy I am. What about... "rooftastic"? [squee]
520008 "Rooftastic"?
520007 As in, I'm gonna stand on the roof and yell to everypony how rooftastic this is!
520000 [thump]
520008 What if our families don't like each other?
520007 We are friends, Applejack, and after tonight, our families are gonna be friends too. Do you know what that means? Number of Apples times number of Pies is twenty four, minus my preexisting friendships plus one for Maud and you makes five from twenty four is... [deep breath] nineteen new friendships! Maud! [squeals]
520242 [deadpan] I'm so excited to see you, Pinkie Pie. You too, Applejack. I hope you had fun sledding yesterday.
520008 How'd you know that?
520242 [deadpan] Isn't it obvious? There are specks of extrusive andesite on your hoof. It's a mountain rock.
520009 [hushed] Oh, she's good.
520007 How's school going?
520242 [deadpan] If you thought quartz was high on the Mohs hardness scale, wait 'til I tell you about corundum.
520007 I missed you so much!
52000b Mm-hmm.
520008 This place looks amazin'!
520007 Come on, everypony! Meet my super-mega-fun-derful family! Everypony, meet everypony!
5202f4 Surely thy name is not but Granny Smith. I am called Igneous Rock Pie, son of Feldspar Granite Pie.
5200c0 Thou shalt know me as Cloudy Quartz.
5202f4 May Providence favor thee well, and to thou comfort our humble homestead bring.
520009 Y'all gabbin' with words real funny-like. Wh-wh-what'd you say them names were? "Iggy"? And I'm just gonna call you "Big Mama Q"!
5202f5 Gaze into the eyes of Limestone Pie. Ma and Pa may own this rock farm, but I keep it running. Cross me and—
520007 Aye aye, Captain Grumpy! No one's gonna mess with your precious mine!
5202f5 Or Holder's Boulder!
520007 [sighs] Everypony stay away from Holder's Boulder. There, you happy now?
520008 And you must be—
520007 This is Marble Pie, my baby sister who's only a few minutes younger than me but she'll always be a baby to me, isn't that right? She's so excited to meet everypony! Oh, and she wishes you all a happy Hearth's Warming!
520000 [beat]
5202f6 Mm-hmm.
520008 [hushed, to Apple Bloom] Guess Pinkie Pie always did the talkin' for her.
52000a [giggles]
520007 [whistles] Attention!
5202f5 What'd I say about the boulder?!
520007 I'll just be a second. Everypony get settled in! There's plenty of room upstairs. And then it's time for Hearth's Warming Eve dinner!
520000 [confetti exploding]
520008 [hushed] So far, so good, cousin!
520007 Hee-hee!
520000 [bed springs bouncing]
52000a Oh, I can't wait to taste their fresh sweet rolls! They're my favorite part of Hearth's Warmin' Eve dinner.
520009 I'm more of a six-layer bean dip filly myself!
52000a I love that too! Oh, Applejack, do you think theirs'll be even better than ours?
520008 Well, that's a mighty tall order, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least.
520007 Are you excited for dinner time? Because guess who is! Spoiler alert – it's me!
520000 [soup pouring]
520000 [splash]
520008 What about hot rolls and mulled cider and double-baked pot pie?
520009 Uh, what about six-layer bean dip?
520242 [deadpan] We have rock soup.
520007 Potato, po-tah-to. Double-baked pot pie, rock soup! Dinner is dinner. Am I right or am I right?
520000 [beat]
520008 Yeah, um, you know what? This is what we were expectin'! Right, everypony?
520212 [uncertain noises]
520008 [laughs nervously]
520007 [slurping, exhales] Is everything all right, Applejack?
520008 O' course, I'm just being a rusty fiddle. Tune me up and let's get back to dinner. [slurping] [gag, coughs]
520007 More rock, please!
520000 [soup pouring]
520007 Eat up, so we can get to our Hearth's Warming dolls!
520008 Now that's somethin' I know all about!
520000 [picking noises]
520007 Who wants a Hearth's Warming doll?
520008 Are you sayin' that rock is a Hearth's Warmin' doll?
520007 Don't be silly, silly!
520000 [picking noise]
520000 [crumbling]
520007 Our dolls are these little pieces! Isn't that right, Marble Pie?
520000 [beat]
5202f6 Mm-hmm.
520000 [picking noises]
52000a Our dolls are... rocks?
520000 [snap]
520000 [crunch]
520008 Uh... y'all don't have traditional crocheted dolls passed down in your family?
520007 Aww, you're just a frown factory because you got a weird rock. Cheer up! I'm sure you'll do great in the flag finding mission!
520008 The what findin' what now?
520007 Limestone Pie, you're the judge! Big Mac, Marble Pie, you're team one! Apple Bloom and Maud, you're team two! Ma, Pa, you're gonna be with Granny Smith. Don't think of it as team old. Think of it as team three! And I'm with Applejack of course, since we might be cousins!
520008 So now that we're all split up, mind tellin' us what we're doin'?
520007 As everypony knows—
5202f5 Stay off Holder's Boulder!
520007 Sheesh. When the three tribes united to form Equestria, the first flag was sewn by Nimble Thimble. It's tradition to raise a flag on Hearth's Warming to celebrate that famous day.
5201aa [general agreement]
520007 But who gets to put the flag on Holder's Boulder?
520008 You mean on the flagpole?
520007 No, silly, it goes on the highest point! And who's the lucky pony?
520008 Traditionally, it's the youngest—
520007 [quickly] On your marks, get set, go!
520008 Pinkie Pie, will you please tell us what's goin' on?
520007 I'll explain on the way!
520008 [yelps]
520008 I still don't understand.
520007 Earlier today, Limestone Pie hid an obsidian stone. Whoever finds it gets to raise the flag!
520008 It's all just so... complicated, and... rock-based.
520007 Well, how else would we do it?
520008 I don't know. I sure hope everypony else is havin' a better time.
5202f6 Mm-hmm.
520026 Eeyup.
5202f6 Mm-hmm.
520026 Eeeeeeeeeyup.
520009 So, how'd you meet this Iggy feller?
5200c0 We were chosen by the Pairing Stone and betrothed within a fortnight.
5202f4 The choosing stone decreed, "Thou shalt love one another." And lo, it was so.
520009 Hoo-wee, I gots to look into this oldfangled choosin' stone thing. You reckon it knows any apple-farmin' hunks?
5202f4 Indeed so.
5200c0 [simultaneously] Mmm.
52000a What does the rock look like?
520242 [deadpan] It looks like something that formed when volcanic lava cooled quickly.
52000a Oh.
520242 [deadpan] Have you ever wished you could turn into a rock?
52000a I had a dream once I was an apple.
520242 [deadpan] We have a lot in common when it comes to thinking about turning into things.
520007 Found it, found it, found it!
520008 A picture? I've been lookin' for a real stone, Pinkie Pie!
520007 Um, that would be weird. Do you know what this means? I get to raise the flag, and now it's time to hide the presents!
520008 Y'all hide your presents?
520007 Of course! What's more fun than getting a present? Finding a present! Although, most years, nopony finds one.
520008 So nopony gets presents?
520007 Eh, not usually.
520008 So lemme get all this straight. You're only allowed to eat rock soup for dinner, then the pony who finds this rock gets to raise the flag, but not really 'cause you don't got no flagpole, and to top it off, you don't even get presents?!
520007 Well, it doesn't sound very fun when you say it that way.
520008 Well, how 'bout you picture this? Both our families, openin' presents, raisin' the flag...?
520007 Picturing it... Loving it...!
520007 Goodnight, everypony!
520008 Goodnight, Pinkie Pie! [hushed] We've gotta do somethin', y'all! Pinkie Pie's family never had a real Hearth's Warmin'!
520009 Is that really what she said?
520008 Well, I-I'm sure it's what she meant.
52000a These are their traditions.
520026 Eeyup.
520008 [sighs] I know they have their traditions and we have ours, but I just want them to see how much better theirs could be.
520000 [rooster crows]
520007 Hearth's Warming!
520000 [thump]
520007 Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's Warming! Hearth's Warming, Hearth's— [strangles out]
5202f4 Oh, my. Oh, my.
5202f5 What. Happened. To. My. Farm!
520008 It's Hearth's Warmin', Apple-style! We've been doin' everythin' your way, I thought we could mix it up a bit! Marble Pie, you could raise the Equestria flag up this pole, because you're the youngest Pie! Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up a meal you'll never forget! And look, we all get presents without havin' to find 'em!
520007 ...Yeah, this is gonna be great! All the stuff she's said. Right, everypony?
5202f4 Pinkamena Diane Pie! Truly thou cannot favor this madness!
520007 Well, I wanna be one big family!
5202f5 But what about what we usually do?!
520007 I, um, well, I-I don't know! [tearing up] Don't make me choose!
520008 I didn't mean to cause a fuss... Why don't we just open presents around the flag pole? It'll be fun, you'll see!
520242 Excuse me. You planted your pole on a fault line.
520000 [rumbling, cracking, thud]
5202f5 Nooooooooooooooo!
520000 [crunch]
520008 Oh, boy.
520000 [bell ringing]
520007 You didn't have to ask them to leave!
5202f5 They wanted to go! We don't need anypony forcing their way into our family!
520007 This was all a misunderstanding, everypony! I know Applejack, and she'd never do anything bad to anypony!
5202f5 Look around, Pinkie Pie! It's gonna take me ages to get this rock farm back on track! And how are we gonna lift Holder's Boulder?! This is all her fault!
520007 Then it's my fault too...
520000 [thud]
520009 Prob'ly best if we head back to Sweet Apple Acres. Maybe in time we'll be friends again, but for the now it's best if we give them a little space.
52000a I wish we didn't have to. I really like Maud. She's sweet once you get to know her. They all are. Worst Hearth's Warmin' ever.
520009 Eh, has anypony seen Applejack?
520008 [sniffling] I really cracked the corn this time.
520007 [sniffling] I really popped the piñata this time.
520008 Pinkie Pie?
520007 [yelps] What are you doing here?
520008 What are you doin' here?
520211 [simultaneously] I came here to think! You did? So did I! [laughing] Aww.
520008 I'm too ashamed to go back up there. Your family, my family, they all must think I'm such a nincompoop.
520007 Aw, no one thinks that! Pushy, aggressive, mean... Oh, I'm not helping. Sorry.
520008 I'm sorry I forced my traditions over yours. I don't want you to have to choose between the family you were born into and the friends who love you like one. I really hoped we could be one big happy family. I guess not.
520007 Don't say that!
520000 [train whistle blows]
520008 I wish I could stay, but I have a train to catch.
520007 [crying] H-Ha... Happy Hearth's Warming.
520008 [tearing up] You too.
520000 [train noises]
520009 You want to know why Holder's Boulder's so danged important? [exhales] Well, now their great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Holder Cobblestone – he found that boulder in a dragon's nest, older than time itself! He built the family farm around it, even though it was just an ordinary rock. It always brought them good luck.
520008 Aw, crickets! That is important! I got so caught up in the things they were doin', I never asked why they did 'em!
520000 [smack]
520008 [reading] To Applejack, from Pinkie Pie. Cousins forever.
52000a You just found your first Pie Hearth's Warmin' present ever!
520008 [laughing] Only Pinkie Pie could hide a present on a movin' train. ...What a great tradition. [beat] Stop the train!
5202f7 [straining]
520007 [straining] Come on... you... boulder, come on... agh!
520242 [deadpan] I'm pushing as hard as I can too.
5202f7 [straining]
5202f5 Rrrgh, it's hopeless!
520008 Need a little help?
520007 [gasps] Apples!
5202f5 What do you want?!
520008 I wasn't tryin' to take your traditions away, I was tryin' to share ours. I was so focused on us bein' one big happy family, I thought we needed the same traditions right away. What I should've done was learn about yours and teach you about ours. And over time, we'd make new traditions together. I'm sorry, y'all.
520000 [beat]
5202f5 Well, don't just stand there! We got a boulder to move! And I'm in charge.
5202f8 [straining]
520007 I think we've just invented our first combined tradition! Pushing Holder's Boulder out of the quarry! [squeals] I can't wait for Applejack to knock it over next Hearth's Warming!
5202f8 [laughing]
52000a [swallows]
520007 Marble Pie, you want to wish Big Mac a happy Hearth's Warming, don't you! And you too, right, Big Mac?
5202f6 Mm-hmm!
520026 [short giggle] Eeyup.
520009 Eh, lemme see here, uh... 'If thou ask-eth me, uh, thou two art, eh, okay-eth in my book'.
5202f4 'Yee-haw'.
520000 [paper ripping]
520007 Happy Hearth's Warming!
520008 Happy Hearth's Warmin', Pinkie Pie.
52000a Attention, everypony! Maud wants to sing some Hearth's Warmin' carols that she wrote!
5202f8 [various cheers]
520242 [deadpan] The first one is about rocks. They're all about rocks. [reading, deadpan] Hearth's Warming is great. Like calcium silicate. What a wonderful day. As good as mica or clay.
520000 [carol-type music plays over credits]
521000 [shades closing]
521000 [windows clattering]
52100e Fuzzy Legs, do you think you could secure those windows?
521000 [webs shooting]
521000 [windows close]
52100e And you'll alert me if anything scary comes close to the cottage?
521000 [birds squawk]
52100e Oh, who am I kidding? When something scary comes close to the cottage! Please tell me my hiding place is ready.
5212f9 [growls]
52100e Oh, look, you've filled it with everything I need to survive this awful night. Thank you. Thank you all! Now I don't have to step a hoof outside until this whole thing is over.
521000 [bucket clattering]
52100e Oh, no! You don't have any carrots? Do we have any other fresh veggies you may enjoy?
521040 [growls]
52100e Or maybe some hay? But that means I'll need to go out... on Nightmare Night!
521000 [thunder and lightning]
521000 [ponies laughing]
521000 [theme song]
521000 [fireworks]
521000 [eerie sound effects]
5212fa [giggling]
52100e [screams]
5210f3 [singsongy] Nightmare Night, what a fright! Give me something sweet to bite!
52100e [gasps]
5210f3 [singsongy] Nightmare Night, what a fright! Give me something sweet to bite!
521009 Fluttershy? What're you doin' out and about? It's Nightmare Night, remember?
52100e How could I forget? Oh, I don't suppose I could borrow a few pieces of hay from you? I forgot to stock up on food for Angel, and you do seem to have quite a lot.
521009 We need it for the Apple Family Haunted Maze. [spooky voice] The scariest maze that there ever was. Who knows what lurks inside?
52100e Oh, I'm sure I don't.
521009 Is that a mummified pony that just leaped out at ya?
52100e I don't know. Is it?
521009 And what's that crunchin' sound beneath yer hooves? Maybe it's the bones of ponies that didn't make it out alive!
52100e B-B-B-B-Bones?!
521009 And are those peeled grapes or a thousand slimy eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave?
52100e Please tell me they're grapes!
521009 Oh, I'll never tell. [maniacal laughter]
521000 [thunder and lightning]
52100e [frightened sobs]
521009 Huh. I wonder what got stuck in her craw.
521000 [thunder and lightning]
521000 [door opens]
52100e Twilight? Hello? [screams]
521005 You think it's scary now, just wait until it's done.
52100e That's okay. I'll take your word for it.
521005 [grunts] Hey, wait a minute! It's Nightmare Night and you're here and not holed up in your cottage! Does this mean what I think it means?
52100e That I foolishly forgot to stock up on food for Angel and had to go out to get him something but got spooked in town so I came here hoping Twilight had some lettuce I could give him?
521005 Oh. I thought maybe you decided to come out with us tonight.
52100e Goodness, no! I couldn't be out tonight. I just couldn't.
521005 Technically speaking, you already are out right now.
52100e Oh. I guess that is true.
521005 So what if you stayed out a little longer with your friends? I know they'd be super excited.
52100e You think so?
521005 You would make them so happy if you joined in. They wouldn't believe their eyes! Come on, Fluttershy, what do you say?
521000 [distant laughter]
521007 And then it got very, very quiet and suddenly they realized the balloons had never been inflated!
521264 [scream, laugh]
52100d Did I ever tell you about the night that the mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes?
52100c What happened?
52100d I just told you, darling. A mannequin came to life and haunted all the costumes.
521007 [squeals]
52100e Hi, everypony.
521015 [scream]
521003 Fluttershy, what are you doing here? Is everything okay?
52100e Everything is fine. In fact, it's more than fine. I've decided to join you in your Nightmare Night festivities.
52100c [scoffs] Seriously? You? Out? Tonight?
52100e Every Nightmare Night, I shut myself in my cottage and refuse to come out until morning. But it's just like when I was afraid to sing in front of anypony. If I hadn't given it a try, I never would've found out how much I enjoy it.
521008 And we'd have missed out on how great you sound.
52100d Fluttershy with us on Nightmare Night? Why, that's positively the most wonderful news I've heard in ages!
521007 You can get dressed up in a costume with us and play Nightmare Night games with us and eat candy apples with us!
521008 Don't forget the best part. Goin' through my family's corn maze!
521007 [squee]
52100e Oh, right. The maze.
521008 Uh, only if you're up for it.
52100e Oh, I am! I am ready to take on Nightmare Night!
521015 [cheering]
52100e [shuddering] [giggles] Just practicing. [nervous laugh]
521080 [giggling]
52100d Mummy? No. Headless pony? No. Vampire fruit bat? Ugh, definitely no. You see, Fluttershy, the beauty of Nightmare Night is that you don't have to dress up as something scary.
521000 [smack]
52100d Ooh! Yes. This one will look gorgeous on you. Period costumes are all the rage this year. What? No good?
52100e What if we encounter something terrifying and need to get away quickly? All those layers could slow me down, or worse, make me trip!
52100d Oh. I never... considered that. Never fear!
521000 [smack]
52100d [hums] Ooh, now this is a real stunner! I call it "Masquerade"! Just a simple black dress underneath but with this ornately decorated mask!
52100e A mask?
52100d No?
52100e They can just be so difficult to see out of.
52100d Yes, but this one has eyeholes.
52100e W-What about being able to see what's to the left or right of me?
52100d I suppose your vision would be somewhat obscured. It's your first Nightmare Night out and about, and we do want you to be comfortable.
52100e What if I just wear the dress?
52100d Oh, sure, dear. That's... fine. [to herself] It's so plain, it's frightening. [out loud] Oh, my! Look at all of you! My costumes fit you to a T!
521008 Hoo-wee, we're gonna have the best time!
521000 [door opens]
52100c Hey, Fluttershy, where's your costume?
52100e I'm wearing it.
521007 [gasps] I get it! You're a robber escaping into the night! You're a ninja escaping into the night! You're black licorice escaping into the night!
52100e Close. I'm going to a masquerade ball. Without the mask.
521000 [bonk]
521003 Oh, that's great! Isn't it great?
52100c Oh, yeah.
521007 So creative.
521008 Great costume.
521007 I figured I'd save the really scary games for next year when Fluttershy's more used to it.
52111a Round and round and round you go, where you stop nopony knows!
521007 Okay... go!
52100c [grunting] Good luck beating that, Fluttershy!
52100e Well, um, it's just that if I'm blindfolded and somepony were to leap out in front of me, I'd never have the chance to defend myself.
52100d That's fine, darling. You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
521003 We're just glad you're here.
521007 We don't have to finish that game. I have another one I know you'll love! Bobbing for apples!
521000 [splash]
52100e [gulps]
521003 Fluttershy, what's wrong?
52100e It's just that, um... What happens if, when my head is deep down in the water, some kind of scary monster appears? How would I even hear to know I was under attack?
521000 [beat]
521007 Time for candy!
52100e It is?
521007 I made candy bags. Each bag has been made with each of you in mind, complete with each of your favorite candies!
52100c Ha! Awesome!
521007 Here. Take it. Take it! What are you waiting for?
52100e Well, it's just... What if when I'm eating one of these chewy taffies, my mouth becomes glued shut and I can't scream for help?
521000 [beat]
52100e Oh, goodness. We've only just started to celebrate Nightmare Night together, and I'm already taking all the fun out of it, aren't I?
521007 You're not taking out all of the fun.
52100c Just, like, ninety per—
521000 [clang]
52100c ...Some of it.
52100e I really wanna do this. But there's just so many things that terrify me about tonight. I couldn't possibly predict what might upset me.
521003 Unless... you were the one doing the scaring!
52100c Her scaring us? [laughing] Oh. You're being serious.
521003 The thing you hate is being scared, but if you're the one doing the scaring, then...
52100e Then I can help you all have fun and I can still be a part of Nightmare Night!
521003 So you like that idea?
52100e I think I do! And I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I think I have the perfect idea for how I'm gonna do it!
521007 Really? Oh, this is so exciting!
52100e [spooky voice] Meet me at my cottage in an hour. [normal voice] Oh, I'm excited to see everypony soon!
521000 [knocking at door]
521000 [door creaks]
52100e [spooky voice] Welcome to Fluttershy's tea party!
52100c Did she just say "tea party"?
521003 It sounds like it's a scary tea party?
52100c [sighs]
52100e [spooky voice] Have a seat. Don't be scared of what awaits you. Go on. Pass the sugar. Oh, no! There is none! You're a terrible host! Rarity, put your coat on!
52100d Why would I do that?
52100e [spooky voice] You need to cover up because no one has complimented your dressssssss! Pinkie Pie, look to your left and ask your best friend to pass the cucumber sandwiches!
521007 Huh? I can't. There's nopony there.
52100e [spooky voice] That's right. Because she didn't care to show uuuuuup.
521007 What?
52100e [spooky voice] A friend who didn't come through. That must scare you to the coooore. Quick, everypony, look behind you!
52100c Uh, what are those?
52100e [spooky voice] They're unplanned guests. Your woooorst nightmare. You don't have enough food for them! Oh, no! There's a tiny kitten that needs a home! But you are over-scheduled right now. You don't have time to help! I said, "You don't have time to help!" This should appear to scare you! [normal voice] Why don't you look terrified? You showed up to a party and everypony was extremely disappointed in you. Can you imagine anything more upsetting?
52100d It was a really good try, darling, but the scares at Nightmare Night are of an entirely different nature.
521003 It was really creative, though. I never would have thought of... all this.
521000 [thunk]
52100e Oh, I'm just not cut out for this. Just go on without me.
52100d Oh, no. We couldn't possibly.
52100e You have to. This is the night you look forward to all year.
521007 We could... stay here?
52100e It's okay. I really want you all to have fun. This is how I spend every Nightmare Night. Please go. I'll be fine.
521007 Eh, it's funny. I actually thought she had an idea for something really scary for a second there.
521008 She definitely tried her hardest.
521000 [door closes]
52100e I did try my hardest.
521040 [thumping on table]
52100e Or... maybe not. I suppose I could have gone with something a bit scarier. You're right! I've been taking baby steps! I think it's time for grown up ones! I don't suppose you have any ideas how I could do that?
521040 [growls mischievously]
521008 Everypony's linin' up for the corn maze, y'all! Let's go!
521005 Oh, yeah! I can't believe we're finally doin' this!
521000 [horse whinny]
521015 [scream] [laugh]
52100c It's a good thing Fluttershy isn't here because she would never be able to handle this!
521000 [distant screams]
521015 [gasp]
521026 Boooo... Eeyup.
521015 [laugh]
521000 [crackling]
52100d What. Is. That. Sound?
521007 It looks like... bones!
521015 [scream]
52100c Looks like a bunch of dried sticks painted white to me.
521008 Hey, try to keep up the illusion, would ya?
52112f Gah!
5212fb [laugh]
521007 Eeew!
521000 [whoosh]
521008 Agh! What was that?
521005 Don't you know?
521008 Uh, o-of course I do. It was, uh...
521000 [ghostly moans]
521000 [peeyow!]
521015 [scream]
521000 [moaning continues]
52100d [grunts] Fluttershy had a point with the layers on the dress.
521000 [moaning continues]
521008 [exclaims]
521015 [yell]
521000 [thud]
521015 [groan]
52100d What is this? Is it a tunnel? Where does it lead?!
521000 [grinding]
521000 [slam]
521003 Which way are we supposed to go now?!
521008 Uh, I don't know! I don't know what's goin' on!
52100c [grunts] What do you mean? Didn't you help plan this?
521000 [creaking chair]
521008 Whew. There's Granny Smith. Not that I was ever scared, 'cause I wasn't. I'm a pretty good actress when I wanna be. Granny? [screams]
521015 [scream] [panting]
521000 [crash]
521005 Applejack, didn't you know about any of this?!
521008 Alright, I got to admit I didn't know about any of this, but maybe they're just tryin' to make it interestin' for me, too! I'm sure Granny Smith or Big Mac is behind this.
521009 [muffled] Are those peeled grapes or eyeballs starin' at ya from beyond the grave? [cackling]
521026 Eeyup.
521080 [playful scream]
521008 [teeth chatter] That's what we were supposed to do! I don't know why we're down here! This is really scarin' me now!
521007 [teeth chattering]
521000 [foot stomps]
5212b8 [growls]
521007 How did that get down here?!
5212b8 [roars]
52100c RUUUUUUUUUN!
52111b [panting] [grunt]
521007 I can't see!
521015 [grunting]
52100c I can barely move! It's like glue!
5212b8 [roaring]
521003 [grunts]
521000 [teleportation zap]
5212b8 [growls]
521015 [panicked screams]
5212fc [deep cackles] [snarls]
521015 [whimpering]
52100e Oh, my! I'm so, so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?
521008 Fluttershy?
52100c It was you the whole time?!
521003 I can't believe it!
52100d That... was...
521007 THE BEST THING EVER! [squee]
52100c It was way more terrifying than the most terrifying thing I could have thought of!
521008 You out-nightmared the scariest part of the corn maze!
521003 How did you do all this?!
52100e After you left, I realized that I wasn't ready to give up on Nightmare Night. So I asked Granny Smith if I could try to make the maze even scarier for my friends.
52100c You came up with all of this?
52100e I had some help. Angel was the scary figure that kept scurrying after you in the maze. Fuzzy Legs made the sticky wall that made it difficult for you to see and move. And, of course, Harry was the especially scary monster.
5212f9 [growls happily]
521003 Wow! That was inspired!
521007 You have to do this every year!
521008 Uh-huh!
52100d Absolutely!
521003 Every year!
52100c Yeah!
52100e We could celebrate Nightmare Night together every year. But the truth is I really don't want to.
521007 You don't?!
52100d But you've done it. You found a way that we can all have a fabulous time together.
52100e Yes, but I've also realized something. You all may love Nightmare Night and I may be good at being a part of it, but it's no fun for me to see my friends feel like they're in danger, even if I know they're not. I really don't like it. It's just not my cup of tea.
521007 Spoooooooooky tea?
52100e No. Just regular tea. We do lots of fun things together, but I'm afraid this just isn't gonna be one of them. Actually, I'm not afraid. I'm perfectly fine with it.
521003 Then we are, too.
5212f9 [growls happily]
521000 [bats squeaking]
52100e [sighs] I don't know why I doubted myself for a second. Now this is what I call a perfect Nightmare Night.
521000 [credits]
522005 [sighs] Didn't we just shelve all the books in the library a few months ago?
522003 Yes, but that was because we needed to! This is just because I want to! I call it my "book-sort-cation"! Three uninterrupted days of reorganizing books. Can you think of anything more relaxing?
522005 Well, claw massages, back rubs, bubble baths... You weren't really looking for an answer, were you?
522003 I've even devised a better system for organizing them. It decreases the amount of time it takes to find a book you're looking for by nearly three quarters of a second!
522005 [flatly] Whoa. That much?
522003 Look at them all. Why, there must be at least twenty thousand books to organize!
5220c3 [hoots]
522003 Best long weekend ever! I'm sure we can make some time for a claw massage and a back rub too.
522005 Yes! Best long weekend ever!
522000 [theme song]
522000 [door opens]
522003 [exhales]
522005 Whoa! That strange yellow orb in the sky! What is that?
522003 Alright, alright, so it's been a little while since we've seen the sun.
522005 A little while? We've been in that library for three straight days!
522003 Yes, but they were three very productive days! Even if you did take that two-hour claw massage break.
522005 Hey, you promise a claw massage, I'm getting a claw massage.
522003 It's not like we missed anything.
522000 [crash]
5222fd Hello, Twilight! Hi, Spike!
522003 Hi, Rainbow Dash. Good to see you, Discord.
522005 Did you rehearse before you found us?
5222fd What makes you think we practiced?
522003 Come on, Rainbow Dash. What's going on here?
52200c [laughing] Sorry. Me and Discord are just messin' around. Like we do.
522003 Since when?
5220db Oh, Twilight. We simply had a momentous time together these past three days. You could say it was... "hiss-terical"! [laughs]
52200c [laughing] Sneaky snake!
5220db [laughing] Just snaking around!
52200c Good one, Discord! [laughing]
522003 It is?
52200c Kind of an inside joke from this weekend. You wouldn't really get it unless you were there.
522003 Oh. Okay.
52200c Cool. Well, uh, catch you later, Twilight!
5220db [laughing] Catch you later, Twilight.
522000 [whirling]
522000 [magic zap]
522003 That was strange, right? Since when have Rainbow Dash and Discord had inside jokes?
522005 Since sometime in the last three days, I guess.
522003 Hey! Nopony made you join me on my book-sort-cation.
522005 I'm jokin', I'm jokin'!
522000 [door opens, bell rings]
522003 Rarity?
52200d [gasps] Twilight! You've returned from your book sorting sabbatical! All that organizing has done wonders for your complexion!
522003 Thanks! It was very relaxing. And we were able to clear a shelf for those old-fashioned books you wanted to donate.
52200d Oh, pfft, they're not old, darling. They're vintage, and they're over there! I've even included my favorites by former Canterlot designer to the stars Rococo Froufrou!
522005 Oh, I love her!
52200d Him.
522005 [laughs nervously] Both.
5220db Twilight! This makes twice I'm seeing you in one day! Aren't I lucky?
522003 Weren't you just with—
52200e Hi, Twilight! Hi, Spike! How was your book-sort-cation?
522003 It was good!
52200e [giggles] Orange you glad you did it?
5222fe [laughing]
52200d [within laughter] "Orange you glad"! Oh, Fluttershy, you're a card! [laughing]
52200e Oh, please. You'll make me blush.
5220db You do seem to be turning a shade of... [gasps] orange!
52207e [laughing]
52200d Oh, sorry, darling. You see, we were at Sweet Apple Acres and, uh, ooh, how to explain...
5220db Well, let me try and paint her a picture, dearest.
522005 [to himself] "Dearest"?
5220db [imitating Bob Ross] You see, we were all at Sweet Apple Acres, and I ended up turning the trees into the most— [normal] Oh, who am I kidding? I simply can't do it justice. You really had to be there.
52200e We would've invited you to come along too, but we didn't want to interrupt your organizing. We know how important it is to you.
5220db And I'm sure it was much more important than the fun that we had. [laughs]
522003 I appreciate that... Speaking of books, I should get these on the shelves.
52207e [laughing]
522003 Hmm. Rainbow Dash bonding with Discord, Rarity finding something he did genuinely funny... Must've been some weekend.
522005 Somepony sorry she missed it?
522003 Of course not.
522211 [laughing]
522003 What's got you two in hysterics?
5220db [gulps] Oh, we were just reminiscing about the best weekend ever!
522003 [hushed] He's everywhere today, isn't he?
5220db Oh, now where was I? Ah, yes, we had just finished our soup, and then Applejack said, [imitating Applejack] "Peanut butter hoof? Yuck, not even with jelly!"
522211 [laughing]
522003 Eh, I don't get it.
522007 [laughing] It was hilarious! I wish we'd taken a picture for you!
5220db Oh, well, this should do!
522000 [tapping]
522211 [laughing]
522003 I guess that's funny?
5220db Well, seems this has become quite the... sticky situation! [laughing]
522211 [laughing]
522007 [within laughter] Sticky situation!
522008 Aw, shucks, Twilight. We haven't even asked how your weekend went.
522003 It was fine!
5220db And yet you look so glum. Does somepony need a huggy-wuggy? [babying noises]
522000 [sproing, sproing]
522003 I am not glum. I'm glad! I'm glad you all had such a good time together. Having inside jokes can really create a lasting bond between friends.
5220db I'm just sorry that all this bonding happened while you were holed up in your castle.
522008 Heh. Oh, don't you worry about Twilight. Bet you were in hog heaven organizin' all them books. Again.
522003 I'm sure I had just as much fun as the rest of you.
522003 I can't believe I missed out on all that bonding!
522005 [gulps] I knew it! You are jealous!
522003 Spike, I'm the Princess of Friendship. I don't get jealous. I'm sorry I missed out because sharing that experience would've helped me with my Princess of Friendship duties!
522005 [chewing] [mouth full] Come again?
522003 If our friends could enjoy three full days with Discord that much, it must have something to do with the specific things they did together! If we could find out what those things were, it could be a real breakthrough in the science of friendship!
522005 Hm. I guess so.
522000 [magic zap]
522003 I know so! You thought our book-sort-cation was fun? This is gonna be even better!
522003 Thank you for coming. I wouldn't have asked you here if it wasn't important.
522007 I love important!
522003 I want to know how these funny moments you shared came to pass. I can use this data to help advance friendships all over Equestria.
522008 Well, I like the sound of that!
52228c [general agreement]
522003 Perfect. Let's start with the snake.
5222fd [laughing]
52200c I don't know if I can get it out! It's too funny!
5220db Oh, but we must! It's for the greater good! It started when we were helping Granny Smith with her garden...
522000 [flashback music starts]
522008 Uh, I reckon you mean my sister Apple Bloom.
5220db Eh... All you Apples look the same. And then Rainbow Dash saw a snake!
52200e I think it was a garden hose.
52200c It was a hose snake. Super deadly.
522008 I recall it bein' a large stick that looked like a hose that, in turn, did in fact resemble a snake.
522007 Point is, we galloped away.
52200c And it chased after us!
522003 The hose? A snake? A stick?
52200c A snake!
52200e A hose!
522008 A stick!
5220db We literally trotted for our lives. Isn't that hilarious?
52200e I guess you had to be there.
522003 I do need to be there.
52200d But you weren't! And it's already happened! Ooh, are you suggesting...
522007 Time travel?!
522000 [Back to the Future theme plays]
522003 Absolutely not! Time travel is not something to be messed with. We simply need to recreate everything that led to these jokes.
5220db Oh, what a brilliant idea! Shall we begin with the lunch date that kicked off the glorious weekend you missed out on?
522003 Are you sure it was this table?
52200c Uh, does it really matter?
522003 When it comes to science, everything matters. One change to the equation could ruin the experiment.
5220db Ohhhhhh... it was this table here.
522003 Alright, so you sat down at the table, and then what happened?
52200d Oh, well, first I expressed my displeasure with the design of the menu. It—
5220db I'm sorry to interrupt, but I just noticed something.
522003 Yes?
5220db The tablecloth. It isn't the same color as the one the restaurant used on the day in question.
522003 ...Really?
52200d He's right! The tablecloth was red! I remember because it clashed with the font on the menus.
522008 I don't suppose that means we're gonna need to get a new tablecloth, does it?
5220db Oh, most definitely.
522000 [magic sparkles]
52200e Ooh.
522007 Wowee!
5220db One change to the equation could ruin the experiment. Twilight said so herself. Anything stand out as being different? Anything at all?
52200e Um, I've noticed a couple of things.
522007 Me too!
5220db Excellent!
522000 [magic zap]
5220db A little to the left! No, my left! A little bit more... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, a little more right!
522007 The cloud over our table looked like an ice cream sundae!
522000 [stretching]
522007 Perfect!
522000 [slide whistle ascending and descending]
5220db No-no-no-no-no, this is barely room temperature! Garçon! Garçon, over here!
522000 [tapping]
522025 [laughing]
5220db No? Nothing?
522003 Are you sure there's not something you've missed? Some other detail about your lunch together that you're forgetting?
5220db Well, I don't know about the rest of you, but I feel we've been pretty exhaustive in our attempts to recreate every single detail of our previous encounter.
522025 [general agreement]
52200c Yeah, Twilight. If you don't get it by now, I don't think you're ever gonna get it.
522003 But it is really important that I figure this out. It's for the good of all Equestria!
522000 [ticker tape machine whirring]
5220db Well, perhaps we should have another look at the data we've collected. [gasps] Of course! There is one last variable that we haven't accounted for.
522003 What?
5220db You!
522003 Me?
5220db You weren't there observing us. No matter how hard we try, we can't possibly recreate our weekend of fun exactly as it happened because you'll always be watching, and you weren't there.
522025 Hmmm.
522007 He makes a good point.
5220db It has only served to prove that moments of levity and bonding between friends simply cannot be recreated so that others might share in the experience.
522007 He makes another good point!
52200d Oh, don't worry, darling. I'm sure there'll be plenty of other chances for you to share in the kind of [starts giggling] frivolity we had with Discord while you were away.
52200c Yeah, and I'll bet they'll be just as hissssss-terical! [laughing]
5220db [laughing]
52200e [laughing] Absolutely.
522003 I'm not buying it. Not for a second. There is definitely something else going on here, Spike!
522005 [gulps] Or maybe there isn't, and you should just drop this whole thing and admit that you're a little jealous!
522003 Even if I'm not able to laugh at what happened, I should be able to figure out why they find it funny. Why they think they had this amazing and hilarious time together. But I can't figure it out! It doesn't make sense!
522005 Some things just can't be explained.
522003 Our friends think something great happened to them while I was away, but no. It was something awful! If we don't break the spell they're under, who knows what terrible things could happen?!
522005 Spell?
522003 Come on, Spike! There's no time to lose!
522003 Zecora, what do you think? Can you undo Discord's magic?
522000 [powder falling, cauldron bubbling]
522047 In what way can you tell that they are indeed under a spell?
522003 They're having fun with Discord, that's why!
522047 Ah. A friendship with Discord is truly a shock. But who says it is something that we must block?
522003 Trust me, they would never laugh like that unless something magical was involved. It's not that funny. I know funny.
522047 Alright. This potion will break the spell, then you will be able to tell.
522005 Wait. If that's the potion, then what's brewing in your cauldron?
522047 It ties the room together and emits a warm glow. But if I am to be honest, it's just for show.
522008 [yawns] I wonder why she asked us here so bright and early.
52200d Another map adventure, perhaps?
522007 Nope, no glowing tushies here!
52200e Or maybe it's more of a non-adventure. Maybe she just wants to tell us how last night's slumber went?
522000 [door opens]
522003 Hey, gang!
522007 Ooh, you look excited!
522003 I am excited! We're gonna have fun today!
522007 Yes!
522003 Just one tiny, minuscule, microscopic thing before fun times. I need everypony to sip this potion to break Discord's spell on you!
522008 A what now?
522003 Don't be embarrassed. So what if Discord cast a spell on you so you thought you had a great time, and now you have all these inside jokes that you seem to be constantly laughing at? Don't worry! You didn't have your defenses up. I get it.
522000 [liquid pouring]
52200c You're kidding.
52200d Twilight, darling, we simply had a nice time with Discord. As I recall, we spent much of yesterday afternoon reenacting it for you.
522000 [liquid pouring]
522003 Uh-huh. Or you reenacted what you thought was fun but really wasn't because you were under a spell that made you think what happened was fun!
522008 What kind of fertilizer have you had your nose in, Twilight?
522003 Be honest. The only reason you won't drink the potion is because, deep down in your hearts, you know there's a chance that Discord has you under his power!
52200e Twilight, how could you say such a thing?! I know Discord still makes mistakes sometimes, but you're accusing him of being downright evil!
52200c Yeah! And to top it off, you're accusing us of not being able to tell he was up to something! What do you take us for?
522007 Yeah! [glug] What do you [glug] take us for?!
522000 [beat]
522007 Dee-licious! Got any more, Twilight?
522000 [door opens]
5220db Hi, Twilight! The gang mentioned we'd all be hanging out together today!
522000 [liquid pouring]
522003 "The gang"?
5220db Yeah! The peanut-butter-hoof gang! [tapping]
522025 [laughing]
522007 [laughing] It's still funny!
522008 [hushed] So much for that whole "spell" theory.
5222ff [laughing]
522003 Ugh. But it's still not funny!
52200c It's funny if you were there.
522003 But I wasn't there! I wasn't included! Maybe it's my own fault for staying in and having a book-sort-cation when I could have been making jokes and memories and having a great time with my friends! But I didn't do that, did I?! You all did! You were all there, but—! [sighs] I wasn't there. I missed out. And seeing you having all these jokes I wasn't a part of and couldn't understand made me...
522005 Jealous?
522003 No. The Princess of Friendship can't get jealous.
522008 Sure you can, Twilight, and none of us begrudge you for it.
52200e We're sorry if we made you feel left out.
522003 You didn't do anything wrong. You're allowed to share things that don't include me.
52200d And you're allowed to feel a little jealous about it. You just have to be able to admit that that's what you're feeling so you can let it go.
52200c And, you know, not try to make us recreate everything that happened when you weren't around.
522000 [magic zap]
5220db Of course none of this would've happened if I hadn't encouraged everypony not to invite you this weekend.
522003 They wanted me to be there? And you convinced them to not invite me?
5220db Well, I didn't think that they should interrupt you. But now I see that we should have. Oh, I feel just terrible.
522007 You don't look like you feel terrible.
5220db Better?
522008 Wait a minute. You didn't suggest not inviting Twilight because you wanted to make her feel left out, did you?
5220db Of course not. That whole jealousy thing was just a happy accident.
522000 [magic zap]
5220db Certainly we can all agree that Princess Twilight learned a valuable lesson here – that even she can have feelings of jealousy, that she should recognize said feelings rather than trying to pretend that she doesn't have them. Mm-hmm. Did I get the tiniest bit of glee out of watching her try to recreate our weekend of fun in the name of science? Oh, most definitely! But what's important here is that it was never my intent to make Twilight feel jealous. That's something that the old me would have tried to do. Orange you glad I've changed?
522000 [long beat]
5220db I said, Orange you glad I've changed?
522000 [myriad thumps]
522007 [coughs]
5220db Orange! Like the ones at the Applejack farm! I-I mean, from this weekend!
522000 [beat]
5220db No? Nothing? Really? I thought you'd find this hisss-terical!
522000 [rattlesnake tail rattling]
52200d ...Yes, no. Discord, I think these jokes have run their course.
522007 Only way we'd find them funny now is if you put us all under some kind of spell!
522003 Come on, you'd have to be a complete crazy pony to think he'd do something like that! What are you gonna say next, Pinkie? That we all have to drink some weird potion to break the spell?
522025 [laughing]
5220db W-W-What's so funny?
52200c Come on, Discord, do we really have to spell it out for you?
522012 [laughing, continues under]
5220db I-I-I don't get it. Somepony want to tell me what's so hilarious? Anypony? Hello?!
522000 [magic zap]
5220db I'm talking to you! You! And-and you and you! W-W-What's funny about spells? I mean, really, I don't get it, I feel left out and I feel really bad about that...
522005 Sorry, buddy. Guess you had to be there.
522000 [magic zap]
522000 [magic zap]
522300 [laughing]
522000 [credits]
52300e Does everyanimal have their copy of Wuthering Hooves? Hooray! I love Furry Friends Book Club! Now, let's discuss the theme of nature as it applies to Hoofcliff's love.
523000 [cutie mark ringing]
52300e Did somepony leave a light on? Oh, it's me. Oh! It's me!
523000 [shimmering and whooshing]
52300e We'll continue this discussion when I get back!
523000 [door closes]
52322b [chattering]
523000 [theme song]
523000 [shimmering and whooshing]
523003 You're here!
523000 [teleportation zap]
523003 Isn't this exciting?!
523000 [cutie mark ringing]
52300e Oh! You were called, too! Thank goodness. I feel so much better going with a friend.
523003 I was about to come and get you, but then I got distracted.
523000 [doors open]
52300e Oh.
523003 Ever since the map called us, I've been doing a ton of research.
523000 [teleportation zap]
523003 Testing out potential friendship problems.
523000 [teleportation zap]
523003 Diversifying my solution portfolio.
52300e Ever since the map called us? But that happened five minutes ago.
523003 I know! But I wanna be one hundred percent prepared! I mean, I'm the Princess of Friendship. How would it look if I couldn't solve a friendship problem?
52300e Oh, I'm so lucky I'm being sent with you. Speaking of which, where are we going?
523003 The Smokey Mountains!
52300e Oh, I've never been there before.
523003 Neither have I. And there isn't a lot of information on them. All I could find was this. The Smokey Mountains harbor the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria between its two majestic mountain peaks.
52300e That's gorgeous. And where there's nature, there's a ton of animal friends!
523003 I can't wait to get started! I'm a little nervous since that's all I could find. I usually like to be a bit more prepared.
52300e You seem pretty prepared to me. Are those for us?
523003 Yep! I've prepared our things. Snacks, books, blankets, books.
52300e You said "books" twice.
523003 There are a lot of books.
52300e Ooh!
523003 What do ya think our friendship problem's gonna be?
52300e [struggling] I don't know. [grunts] But I'm sure we'll figure it out. [grunting, panting]
523003 Do you think it'll be a problem about lying?
52300e [grunts] I'm sure we'll find out when we get there.
523003 You're right.
523003 Ooh! Could it be about when two friends just randomly decide to do something together, but they forget to invite the third friend, and the third friend feels left out?
523003 Or where one friend tells another friend's secret after they asked them not to?
52300e [exhausted] We'll know very, very soon. Since we're almost there.
52300e [groans]
523003 Here. Lemme get that.
52300e [sighs] Thank you.
523003 Sorry I've been a little skiddly-bopty-boo. I just can't believe this is finally happening!
523000 [pumpkins firing]
52300e Whoa!
523003 Whoa! What in Equestria is happening?
523000 [pumpkin firing]
52300e It's nothing like your book said it would be!
523003 Oh, boy. I'm feeling very unprepared. Where do we even start?
523000 [pumpkin firing]
52300e Maybe by figuring out where the flying pumpkins are coming from?
523301 Ready... Aim... Fire!
523000 [pumpkin firing]
523003 Um, hi. Hello. Excuse us, but what are you doing?
523301 We're pumpkinin' our neighbors!
52300e Yes, but, um, why are you... "pumpkining" your neighbors?
523301 Well, because the McColts are just plain rotten. Hey, wait a tick. Who are you two?! You're not spies for the McColts, are ya?
523003 I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship. And I am here to solve your friendship problem.
52300e I'm Fluttershy, and... um... I'm here, too.
523301 Ma Hooffield. Pleased to meet ya, but you're wastin' your time. We don't have a friendship problem. We have... a McColt problem.
523302 And there's absolutely no friendship there.
523003 Well, maybe there could be if we figure out what the McColts did to make you so mad.
523301 Oh, they done so many things. Why, just today, they shot pebbles at our farmhouse an' wrecked it. See, we're not very good at buildin', so all it took was a little pebble. But still!
523303 [squeaking]
52300e Oh, no!
523003 I know what to do. We're gonna talk with these McColts and hear their side of the story. Once we have all the facts, we can put an end to this using reason and rationale.
52300e Good plan. [to mice] That's why she's the princess.
523003 In the meantime, could you please call off the pumpkining?
523301 Oh, alright.
523003 Thanks. C'mon, Fluttershy.
523000 [knock on door]
523304 State your business!
523305 Don't even bother. They're probably spies for the Hooffields.
523304 Hey, wait! You're an Alicorn! I thought just the three princesses were Alicorns.
523003 There are four Alicorn princesses in Equestria now. I am Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship.
52300e And I'm Fluttershy.
523304 We have a new princess? When did that happen? A-A-And how did the Hooffields come by a princess spy?
523003 We are not spies! [to Fluttershy] Why does everypony assume we're spies?
523000 [gate unlocking]
523306 Because we don't get a lot of visitors. I'm Big Daddy McColt. You caught us at a weird time. We're in the middle of a giant feud with our... Terrible neighbors!
523000 [echoes]
523000 [birds squawking]
523000 [farmhouse collapses]
523003 Well, actually, that's why we're here – to solve your problem with the Hooffields.
523306 So you're here to help us get rid of 'em.
523307 [whooping, hollering]
523003 No! That's not what I meant at all!
523306 Well, if you ain't fer us, you're agin' us.
523003 We are not on anypony's side. We're here to help you become friends again.
523306 Well, that's gon' be hard. I don't believe we've ever been friends with the Hooffields!
523003 But you could be! They're just really upset you ruined their farmhouse.
523306 Wait a hog-wogglin' minute! We only did that because the Hooffields pulled the pin out of our wagon wheel!
523000 [wagon collapses]
523306 A whole week's worth of food rollin' down the mountain. Us McColts are mighty fine builders, but we don't know the first thing about farmin'.
523307 [whickering]
523306 We have to travel a ways away to buy our food. Now, we'll be stuck eatin' the pumpkins the Hooffields launched at us. Pumpkin bread, pumpkin soup, pumpkin [mispronounced] quesadillas, pumpkin paella, pumpkin cheese, pumpkin pie, pumpkin frittatas... Actually, that all sounds pretty good. But it'll get old!
523000 [squirrel squeaking]
523003 Have you tried meeting at a neutral location, talking about your problems, and really listening to each other?
523306 What?! No! They'd sooner launch their dinners at us than listen to us.
523003 Well, they'll listen to me. I'm an impartial third party. [voice amplified] Attention, Hooffields and McColts! I'm not on anypony's side, but I can see you're both wasting time and resources on being mean to each other. Ponies are supposed to help each other and be kind. So let's stop this senseless fighting! [speaking normally] There. That should do it. Ready to go home, Fluttershy?
52300e I'd love to. But if we solved the problem already, shouldn't our cutie marks be glowing again?
523003 Oh, yeah. They should be glowing any minute now...
523000 [beat]
523000 [kersplut]
523000 [kaboom]
523000 [whistling]
523003 Or not.
523000 [tomatoes splatting]
523003 So much for potential friendship solution number twenty-eight.
52300e I guess we should find out why the Hooffields are launching tomatoes now.
523301 One at a time, Greenhoof. If you smoosh them tomaters in the slingshot, they won't break on the McColts.
523003 What are you doing? I asked you to stop fighting.
523301 Oh, is that what you were hollerin' about? We thought the McColts rubbed ya the wrong way. So we tomatered them for ya. My mistake. [to Hooffields] Stop the tomater slingshots!
523000 [hay bales falling]
523301 Reload the tomater slingshots! We're gonna paint their mountaintop red!
52300e Bleh!
523003 Well, that didn't work. I was so sure it would.
523000 [hay bales falling]
52300e [gasps] It was a good plan. We need to think of another one. And soon. This fight is really affecting the animals around here.
523003 Not to worry. I'll just, uh...
523000 [pages flipping]
523003 ...find the root of the problem and work from there.
523000 [kaboom]
523003 Pardon us, Ma, but do you remember what started this whole feud in the first place?
523301 They know what they did.
523306 They know what they did!
523003 I'm starting to think neither of you know what either of you have done.
523306 Sure, we do. Them Hooffields did us a grave injustice some time ago for some reason.
523307 Hear, hear!
523003 Okay, backup plan to the backup plan. Maybe we can find some common ground that you can bond over. What do you do when you're not fighting?
523306 That's easy. Gettin' ready to fight.
52300e What do you hope to get out of fighting?
523301 The satisfaction of winnin'!
523003 Of winning what?
523000 [hammering]
523306 The fight, of course! To prove our family is the best!
52300e The best at what?
523301 Winnin'! Haven't you been listenin'?!
523003 So the only thing they have in common is that they both want to win a fight, and neither of them know what it's over. How can I end this feud if I don't know what it's about?
52300e Ooh! Maybe somepony just needs to say they're sorry.
523003 That's a good idea. And friendship solution number forty-eight. But we can move it up.
523003 I'm so glad you agreed to do this. This apology cake will go a long way to making amends between you two. Which part of my argument changed your mind? The part where I said the benefits of friendship outweigh the cost of war, or the part where I said forgiveness is an investment in happiness?
523301 Yeah, yeah. All of it.
523003 Wait. Are you even listening to me?
523304 Who goes there?!
523301 It's Ma Hooffield.
523304 Hooffield alert! Arm the cannons!
523301 With an apology cake!
523304 Did you say "cake"? As in... [slurps] cake?
523301 Consider it a gesture of goodwill from us to you.
523308 [slurping]
523305 I haven't had cake in ages.
523304 Open the gates!
523000 [gates open]
523309 [sniffles] Oh, it's such a bee-utiful cake.
523003 Think of this as more than just a cake. It's the first step in the long road to forgiveness.
52300e Nothing says "let's be friends" like a cake that says, "Let's be friends!" [hushed] I wrote that in icing on the top.
523000 [cracking]
52330a For glory! Whoa!
523306 McColts! Assume Delta Force formation!
523307 Yah!
523000 [both families shouting]
523301 Ready... aim... fire!
523000 [sproing]
523000 [food falling]
523003 Ma Hooffield, you planted ponies in that cake?!
523301 Yeah! [laughing] Wait. Were you serious about apologizin'? Why in Equestria would we do that? We didn't do anythin' wrong!
523306 What're you talkin' about?! You done so many things wrong!
523301 Not as many as you!
52330b [growling]
523000 [both families fighting]
523000 [sounds of fighting]
52300e Um, if you could just not yell so much or maybe stop saying words altogether...
523000 [sounds of fighting]
523000 [thud]
52300e Wah! Twilight?
523000 [pages ripping, magic zaps]
523003 [sighs]
52300e Um, Twilight? We should probably get back there. I mean, if you need a break, that's fine, but I really can't do this without you.
523003 I don't know if we can do this at all. Even if I make things right, they're just gonna fight again.
523000 [critters chittering]
52300e Hey, little fellas. Oh, that's okay, you can come out.
523000 [various critters chittering]
523000 [groan]
523003 What was that?
523000 [critter stomachs rumbling]
52300e Oh, you poor things! There isn't enough food here for you! Oh, brrr, and you're freezing! I'm gonna take you all home with me and get you all hot cocoas. How do you feel about book clubs?
523003 I don't get it. This was supposed to be the most beautiful valley in all of Equestria. What happened?
523000 [squirrel chittering]
52300e What's that? Oh! Uh-huh... Twilight! They know what happened here!
523003 What?
523000 [sounds of fighting]
523003 Stop! You have to listen to me!
523000 [splat]
523003 Everypony freeze! [echoing out]
523000 [magic zap]
523003 [straining] Fluttershy! You have to tell them! [strains] It's a lot harder to freeze an army of ponies than just six of them!
52300e [raised voice] Before you keep fighting, there is something you should know! Long ago, there were two best friends...
52300e [voiceover] ...Grub Hooffield and Piles McColt. When they found the valley between the Smokey Mountains, they knew it was something special. So they made a promise to each other to protect and preserve the valley for all its adorable furry inhabitants. But they disagreed on how to go about it. Grub wanted to start by planting crops so that everypony would have something to eat. But Piles thought it would be better to start by building a shelter to protect them against the cold and wind. The two ponies were unable to come to an understanding, so Piles went ahead and built a shelter anyway, exactly where Grub was gonna start his farm! Grub was upset, so he tore down Piles' shelter so he could plant his crops!
523000 [crash]
52300e [voiceover] They kept fighting back and forth, until it turned into a feud!
523000 [crunch]
523000 [thud]
523000 [water pouring]
523000 [thud]
523000 [crunch]
523000 [splash]
52300e [voiceover] The valley suffered from the constant destruction, until finally the Hooffields and McColts moved to separate mountains.
52300e Even then, the valley and all the animals in it continued to be caught in the crossfire. You see? By fighting, you're destroying the very thing that brought you here in the first place! So it's time you both put your differences aside and come together! If not for yourselves, then for the sake of these cute and cuddly guys!
523003 [straining]
523306 Aw, shucks, we never meant to hurt you little critters.
523301 Yeah, we're sorry!
523000 [squirrel chittering]
52300e They say they accept your apology.
523000 [beat]
523306 Uh, princess? You can unfreeze us now.
523003 [straining] Oh, right!
523000 [thud]
523306 Ma Hooffield? We promise we won't fight you no more.
523301 Us too, except we promise not to fight you. I suppose it doesn't matter who's right. We're both wrong.
523306 That's one thing we can agree on.
52330b [spits]
523000 [critters chittering]
523000 [teleportation zap]
523003 This is wonderful! I am so proud of you two!
523301 Aw, thanks, princess. Though I would just like to point out that I was the, uh, first to admit I was wrong.
523306 That may be, but I promised not to fight first. That counts for more!
523301 Oh, yeah?!
523000 [critters chittering]
523301 Oh, all right. We don't have to speak animal to know what y'all are sayin'. Truce?
523306 Truce.
523000 [sounds of work and critters chittering]
523306 Woo-hoo! Ain't that a pretty sight?
523301 Sure is! The McColts are gonna help us rebuild our homes! Good ones this time.
523306 And the Hooffields are gonna help us grow some crops!
523304 Not pumpkins.
523301 Thanks for teachin' us that friendship is so much better than winnin' a silly argument.
523000 [cutie marks ringing]
52300e Yay! I told you we'd figure it out.
523003 We did, and we didn't need my friendship portfolio to do it. We just needed each other. So, what do you think will happen next? We've all been called by the map now.
52300e Oof! [straining] I'm sure we'll find out when we get home...
523003 What if it summons all six of us to another place? Or another pony we weren't expecting? [gasps] What if it wants us to solve other kinds of problems, like quantum physics, or why the apple doesn't fall far from the tree?
523000 [country music plays over credits]
524000 [creaking and squeaking]
524003 Wow, Applejack! Are you sure you've never managed a concert before?
524008 Well, it turns out doin' up a concert's the same as settin' up a rodeo.
524003 And thanks to Pinkie's connections organizing the Ponypalooza Rock Concert, we've got quite a lineup for the Helping Hooves Music Festival.
524007 Twilight! Applejack! Rainbow Dash! Rarity! Fluttershy! Spike! Pinkie Pie! Oh wait, that's me. Everypony!
524003 What is it, Pinkie?
524007 I have the most amazing news ever! It is totally gonna freak your frizz!
52400c Well, spill it, Pinkie!
524007 It wasn't easy. In fact, it was terribly difficult. But I have managed to book the biggest pony pop star in all of Equestria as the main attraction of the Helping Hooves Music Festival!
524008 Sapphire Shores?
524007 Sapphire Shores?! Please! Sapphire Shores is merely the second biggest pony pop star in Equestria. I have booked the one, the only, Countess Coloratura!
5241ed Ahhh...
524008 Who in the hay is Countess Coloratura?
52430c [gasps]
524116 [gasps]
52430d [gasps]
524000 [poing]
524007 My frizz has been freaked!
524000 [theme song]
524008 Pinkie Pie, who is this Countess Coloratura pony?
524007 Uh, I just told you that she's the biggest pony pop star in Equestria! How-how-how-how-how have you not heard of her?!
524008 Don't know. Though I did know a gal named Coloratura when I was just a filly. [laughs and snorts] Wouldn't it just be the funniest thing if that Coloratura and this Coloratura were the same Coloratura? Heh.
524007 Do you mean to tell me that you actually know Countess Coloratura?
524008 Well, I don't think it's the same pony, since my friend wasn't any sort of high-falutin' countess.
524007 Do you remember her cutie mark?
524008 Sure do. It had this super colorful bunch of musical notes that just shimmered in the light.
524007 You mean... like this?!
524008 Well, fancy that! That there's the very same cutie mark!
524007 Do you have any idea the number of hoops I had to jump through to get her to perform at the festival?! A whole lot of hoops! That pony is very demanding!
524008 Nah.
524007 Yah!
52400d I completely understand. We artistes require certain necessities in order to do our best work.
524008 This was clearly some sort of misunderstandin', 'cause Rara was just as down home as me!
52430e Rara?!
524008 Even that big name was too fancy for her, so I shortened Coloratura to "Rara"!
524000 [foals shouting]
524008 [voiceover] We had the best time at Camp Friendship!
524000 [splat]
524008 [voiceover] Rara was just so easygoin'! We were like two apples from the same branch.
524000 [splashing]
524008 [voiceover] Rara and I prepared this song for the camp talent show. When we performed, she belted it out, singin' in the most colorful, clear voice I'd ever heard!
524000 [Young Coloratura]
524000 Equestria, the land I love
524000 A land of harmony
524000 Our flag does wave from high above
524000 For ponykind to see
524000 Equestria, a land of friends
524000 Where ponykind do roam
524000 They say true friendship never ends
524000 Equestria, my home
524000 [ting]
524000 [ponies cheering]
524008 [voiceover] After camp, we wrote to each other for a bit, but...
524008 ...then we lost touch. But Rara always did want to go to Manehattan to try and make it big. But a demandin' diva? Just you wait, Pinkie. Once Rara gets here, you'll see she's just a plain old pony like you and me.
524007 I don't have to wait – she's here!
524008 Really?
524000 [pop music BGM]
524000 [rumbling and clanking]
524008 Rara?
524007 [squealing] Countess Coloratura!
52430f Clear the way! Stand back! Keep your hooves and tail to yourselves!
524000 [cameras clicking]
524008 No... that can't be her. [clears throat] Um... hi. Remember me? We met at Camp Friendship? I gave you the nickname "Rara"?
524310 AJ?
524008 Yeah! Heh. Howdy, Rara!
52430f [unintelligible whispering]
524000 [splat]
524310 Hoofsies! [short laugh]
52400d Ooh, you got hoofsies from Countess Coloratura! Look! Ooh, she clearly thinks you're very special!
524310 Hoofsies! Hoofsies! Hoofsies! [short laugh]
524008 Yeah... real special.
52430f Now that's how you make an entrance! Big, bold, absolutely stunning! Though it was muddied a bit with your interaction with that dusty farmpony. Do you actually know her?
524310 Oh, yeah, that's my childhood fillyfriend AJ! She was the one that started calling me Rara.
52430f Oh, yes, how cute and... common. Of course, I was the one that started calling you Countess, and just look at how you've moved up in Equestria since then! Why, you've gotten everything you've ever wanted! Speaking of which, where is the pony Pinkie Pie?
524007 Ooh! I'm the pony Pinkie Pie, Mr Manager, sir!
52430f Do you have the water imported from Rainbow Falls that I requested for Countess Coloratura?
524007 I have twenty glass containers full right here!
524000 [clink]
52430f Did I not tell you to provide straws in all of Countess Coloratura's beverages?
524007 Uh, I don't think so. But lucky for you, I have the biggest straw collection in Equestria! I call this straw Fernando.
524000 [flamenco music]
52430f Hm. Let us confirm that you acquired the rest of the items that Countess Coloratura requested before she performs her run-through, shall we?
524007 Ooh, we shall!
52430f Floral arrangements from the royal Canterlot gardens... Chocolate éclairs made by Gustave le Grand... A selection of crystals from the Crystal Empire... Freshly picked cherries from Cherry Jubilee's farm separated red from yellow...
524007 Abso-toot-ly!
52430f Well, by some miracle, your requests have been reasonably met. So let us move on... to rehearsal!
524007 See, Applejack? Demanding!
524008 Pinkie's right, Rarity! The Rara I knew didn't hide behind a veil givin' out fake stamp kisses, sippin' up imported water, and needin' her cherries separated.
52400d Oh, I do understand. Sometimes it's hard to see our friends change.
524008 She's become a whole other pony!
52400d Trust me. Once you see Countess Coloratura perform, you simply won't believe it!
524310 [Coloratura]
524310 Time for the spectacle
524310 Time for the show
524310 The lights are bright and the colors glow
524310 I'm not just anypony
524310 I think you know
524310 The time is now, it's about to blow!
524310 Razzle dazzle
524310 Glitz and glam
524310 Turn it all up, it's a spectacle
524310 Razzle dazzle
524310 Glitz and glam
524310 Turn it all up, it's a spectacle
524310 Give me more
524310 Razzle dazzle
524310 Glitter eyes, big surprise
524310 Lights, cameras
524000 [vocalizing]
524000 Razzle dazzle
524000 Glitz and glam
524000 Turn it all up, it's a spectacle
524000 Hear the applause
524000 Here to impress
524000 Not just a pony, I am the Countess!
524000 [ponies cheering]
524008 Rarity was right! I don't believe it!
52430f Oh, my shining star! Thanks to the sparkling costumes, dazzling choreography, and brilliant vocal effects that I designed, your performance was spectacular, Countess Coloratura!
524310 Oh, [short laugh], thank you, Svengallop!
524008 Correct me if I'm wrong here, but that feller isn't actually complimentin' Rara. He's complimentin' all the bells and whistles he's piled on to make her Countess Coloratura.
52400d Oh, no-no-no-no-no, you don't understand, Applejack. Creating all those elements is a lot of work, and Countess Coloratura's performance wouldn't exist without them.
524008 If you ask me, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing.
524310 Oh, if we're all done here, I'd love to go back to my trailer and rest, Svengallop.
524007 Actually, right now you're scheduled for your meet and greet with the schoolponies!
52430f Ugh. I can totally get you out of meeting with the schoolponies, Countess.
524310 Absolutely not. My favorite part of any event is meeting with the schoolponies!
524008 The schoolponies'll be so happy to hear that, Rara!
524310 Ponyville schoolponies! As part of the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I'm holding a contest where some of you will get a chance to sing with me onstage at the concert tomorrow! Sound fun?
524000 [foals cheering]
524310 Alright! Now who wants more hoofsies?
524000 [foals cheering]
524008 Now that's more like the Rara I remember.
524007 [distant] But... I got everything you requested!
52430f That was for Countess Coloratura! This is for me! And what I want is premium oats!
524007 Oh! Well, we have lots of tasty oats right here in Ponyville!
52430f I would not feed those to a chicken! I want top-of-the-line Appleloosan oats! Next, it appears that we are surrounded by apple trees. Bring me five hundred pre-peeled, pre-cored apples, and I want those things in twenty-four hours!
524007 [gasps] But that's impossible!
52430f Do you want me to pull Countess Coloratura from your little podunk charity show?! Because I will!
524007 Applejack! Svengallop just made all of these new demands and he said—
524008 I heard, Pinkie. But don't you fret. I'll talk to Rara and fix things right up.
52400a Did'ja see, sis?! Did'ja see?!
524310 Is this the little sister you wrote to me about, AJ?
52400a Hold on, Applejack. You wrote to Countess Coloratura about me?!
524310 AJ said you were the best little sister ever, Apple Bloom!
524000 [beat]
524008 Alright now, you'd best get along, little ponies.
524310 [laughs]
524008 Uh... Hey, Rara, you mind if I talk to you about your manager?
524310 Sure, what about him?
524008 Well, while you were meetin' with the schoolponies, he was demandin' all sorts of stuff from Pinkie Pie.
524310 Svengallop works very hard as my manager, AJ, so if he needs some things when we're on the road, I don't see anything wrong with that.
524008 Well, do you see somethin' wrong with him tellin' Pinkie that if she doesn't get those things by tomorrow, he'd pull you from our charity festival?
524310 What? But he knows how important charity is to me, and leaving the festival would completely ruin my image!
524008 I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't give a pickled pippin about your charity work.
524310 That's not true! Svengallop has always supported me in all my interests. You're just saying those things because you're jealous!
524008 Jealous of what? A pony who hides behind a veil so thick she can't see when somepony's usin' her? No, I'm not jealous of that, Rara!
524310 I am not Rara! I am Countess Coloratura! And while we may have been friends when we were young, we have clearly gone in different directions!
524000 [squeaking]
524008 It just ain't right! He's manipulatin' her, and she's just not seein' it!
524007 Enough stewin', more peelin'!
524008 Sorry, Pinkie, but there is no way I'm lettin' that lousy Svengallop use my friend like that!
524007 [groans]
524008 Countess Coloratura!
524310 Wow, AJ, you said my real name.
524008 I said your new name, but I saw the real you hangin' out with those schoolponies yesterday. And I know somepony that'd prefer if you stop doin' those little events.
524310 Ugh, not this again.
524008 Come on now. You've just got to give me a chance to prove what I'm sayin' is true.
524310 And just how are you going to do that?
524008 Do exactly what I say. We'll see if that Svengallop truly has your best interests at heart.
524310 Svengallop? Svengallop! Where are you, Svengallop?
52430f Here I am! Did you need something?
524310 Yes, I was... considering... m-maybe cancelling the contest with the schoolponies...?
52430f Countess, this is wonderful! I've been waiting forever for you to cancel that pointless schoolpony contest.
524310 You... have?
52430f You do it at every charity event, and it does absolutely nothing to promote the Countess Coloratura image that I built! Consider it cancelled. Pinkie Pie!
524007 [out of breath] Yes, Svengallop, sir! [coughs]
52430f We are making some adjustments to the show. Follow me!
524000 [magic twinkling]
524000 [thud]
52430f Cancel the contest for the fillies and schedule me a spa treatment. Now that I don't have to oversee a rehearsal with those brats, I have time for the works! You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!
52430f Okay, Countess Coloratura, all taken care of!
524000 [audio feedback]
52430f [amplified] You know the drill! Deliver, or the diva ditches your dippy charity!
524310 So that's how you've been managing things?
52430f Yeah, so? What's the problem?
524310 The problem is, is you've been using my name to intimidate ponies to get what you want!
52430f But I work incredibly hard for you! I deserve everything I get!
524310 But not because you scare ponies into thinking I won't perform for their charities otherwise! I would never do that to my fans! Which is why you should have known that I would never cancel the schoolponies' contest!
52430f Hmph. All this charity and schoolpony contest nonsense is just remnants of that boring little Rara I met back in Manehattan!
524310 You clearly don't understand the real me!
52430f Ha, that's a joke! I made you somepony! What can you even do without me? Good luck, Countess Coloratura! Good luck.
524008 Oh, Rara, I'm so sorry. Are you gonna be okay for the concert tonight?
524310 Of course. After all, the show must go on!
524310 Oh, my gosh, Rarity, Svengallop's right! This is gonna be a disaster! I'm gonna be terrible!
524008 Can you give us a minute, Rarity?
52400d Certainly.
524008 Now, why's it gonna be so terrible?
524310 Because Svengallop was in charge of everything! The lights, the visuals, the sound! Without Svengallop, I have nothing!
524008 Now, now, don't go gettin' yourself into a tizzy there, Rara. Svengallop turned you into Countess Coloratura and acted like your friend so he could enjoy the perks that came with bein' a star. But the real perk of friendship is gettin' to see your friend bein' true to their self. And Rara, when you're simply yourself, you're the brightest star I've ever seen shine.
524000 [crowd cheering]
524003 Good evening, everypony! Welcome to opening night of the Helping Hooves Music Festival! Now it is my great honor to introduce you to our headlining act – Countess Coloratura!
524000 [crowd cheering]
524310 This song may be familiar, but yet, it's totally different. Kind of like me, Rara.
524000 [ponies uttering confusion]
524310 [Coloratura]
524310 I'm here to show you who I am
524310 Throw off the veil, it's finally time
524310 There's more to me than glitz and glam, oh-whoa
524310 And now I feel my stars align
524310 For I had believed what I was sold
524310 I did all the things that I was told
524310 But all that has changed, and now I'm bold
524310 'Cause I know
524310 That I am just a pony
524310 I make mistakes from time to time
524310 But now I know the real me
524310 And put my heart out on the line
524310 And let the magic in my heart stay true
524310 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
524310 And let the magic in my heart stay true
524310 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
524310 Just like the magic inside of you
524310 And now I see those colors
524310 Right before my eyes
524310 I hear my voice so clearly
524310 And I know that it is right
524310 They thought I was weak, but I am strong
524310 They sold me the world, but they were wrong
524310 And now that I'm back, I still belong
524310 'Cause I know
524310 That I am just a pony
524310 I make mistakes from time to time
524310 But now I know the real me
524310 And put my heart out on the line
524310 And let the magic in my heart stay true
524310 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
524310 And let the magic in my heart stay true
524310 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
524310 Just like the magic inside of you
524310 Just like the magic inside of you...
524000 [crowd cheering]
524310 [amplified] Thank you, everypony! When I arrived at the Helping Hooves Music Festival, I had forgotten who I really was! But then an old friend reminded me what real friendship is about, and she told me that if I was true to myself, I couldn't go wrong! So I have a very special surprise for her. Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, Scootaloo, come on up!
524000 [Coloratura and Cutie Mark Crusaders]
524000 Equestria, the land I love
524000 A land of harmony
524000 Our flag does wave from high above
524000 For ponykind to see
524000 Equestria, a land of friends
524000 Where ponykind do roam
524000 They say true friendship never ends
524000 Equestria, my home
524000 [crowd cheering]
524000 [ting]
524000 [credits]
525003 If somepony had told me when I was a blank flank that one day I'd give a speech to a class at Celestia's School of Magic, I wouldn't have believed it, but...
525000 [cards shuffling]
525003 I hope that I have been up to the task, because I can tell that all of you are and that the future of Equestrian magic is in good hooves.
525005 [clapping] Wow, hehe. That was even better than the first eleven times. [clears throat]
525003 Eh, I don't know, Spike. I'd like to be able to get through the whole speech without looking at the cards.
525005 Come on, Twilight! You can't be nervous about giving a speech to a bunch of magic students!
525003 Oh, I'm not nervous, Spike, but I do have to set a good example, especially for magic students. That's why this speech has to be...
525005 [sighs] Perfect?
525003 Exactly. Let's go through it one more time. [clears throat] When Princess Celestia asked me to speak to you today, I was honored to have the opportunity to talk about my favorite subject - magic.
525000 [theme song]
525003 Obviously, the long term effects of...
525311 Shhhh.
525003 ...the simultaneous acquisition of cutie marks has yet to be determined, but... [sips water] Ahem. Next slide, please.
525005 [snoring] Huh? Huh!
525003 I can speak from my own experience that the power of Cutie Mark Magic is very real, and in the instance of my friends and I, it can be traced to a single event! Without Rainbow Dash's race to defend Fluttershy's honor, this rainboom wouldn't have happened. Fluttershy might never have discovered her love of animals. Applejack might never have realized that she belonged on her farm. And Pinkie Pie might never have decided to leave hers. It might be hard to imagine Rarity without her sense of fabulousness. But it's even harder to fathom what my life would be like. Without this rainboom, I might not have gotten into magic school. Celestia wouldn't have taken me on as her pupil or sent me to Ponyville to meet my friends. And the most powerful thing about Cutie Mark Magic that I found is the connection I share with them.
525000 [beat]
525003 But, um...
525000 [cards shuffling]
525003 The real question about... Cutie Mark Magic is... who it seems to affect.
525005 Starlight Glimmer?
525003 I was sure I saw her, Spike. But when I looked again, she was gone! I'm just worried what she could be up to.
525005 Nothing good, I bet. I heard she wasn't very happy the last time you saw her.
525003 Forcing everypony in her village to have the same cutie mark wasn't right. We had to do something!
525005 And now she's coming back for revenge. Uh, or she was just really interested in your speech!
525003 Honestly, Spike. I'm not really sure what I saw. But as long as I have my friends, I know everything will be all right.
525003 Maybe I was just more stressed about that speech than I thought.
525005 Yeah. That sounds better than Starlight Glimmer coming back with an evil plot for revenge.
525003 Well, when you say it like that, it does sound kinda silly.
525005 Or it's totally true!
52527c Welcome home, Twilight!
525000 [magic zaps]
525003 What are you doing, Starlight?
52527c [laughs] I'd tell you, but I don't want to ruin the surprise! Won't be needing that anymore. [laughs]
525000 [magic zaps]
525000 [clocks ticking]
525000 [magic zaps]
525005 Where'd she go?
525003 I don't know, Spike, but I think we better find out!
525005 I guess we could start with this.
525003 Spike, no! Don't touch that!
525000 [magic zaps]
525000 [clocks ticking]
525049 [screaming]
525000 [door opens]
525007 Huh! [loud chewing]
525049 [screaming]
525000 [clocks ticking]
525049 [screaming]
525005 [continued screaming] Cloudsdale? Starlight doesn't even have wings! Why would she come here?
525003 I don't know, Spike, but it looked like she could fly with just magic! Keep your eyes open. We don't know what she has planned.
525000 [whoosh]
525005 Isn't that Rainbow Dash?
525003 Did Rainbow Dash look really young to you? And I didn't see a cutie mark. You don't think...
525005 ...We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash raced the bullies who made fun of Fluttershy and performed her first sonic rainboom?
525003 Spike, only Star Swirl the Bearded could do something like that, and even his spell just went back a week! How could Starlight do more than the greatest wizard in Equestria?
525000 [paper rustling]
525005 With this.
525003 Star Swirl's spell! Oh, no!
525005 Come on, let's go!
525003 Go where?
525005 To watch the race. I don't wanna miss the rainboom! Whoa!
5250b4 [yelps]
525000 [various whooshes]
525000 [thump]
5250b7 Whoa!
5250b6 Heh. Later, Rainbow Crash!
5250b7 Hey!
52527c Aw, sorry about this.
525000 [magic zap]
5250b7 Hey! What gives?
525000 [foals cheering]
5250b4 [giggling]
525000 [critter noises]
5250af [sighs]
5250c1 [exhales]
525000 [crow cawing]
525000 [crunch]
5250ba [straining]
525000 [magic fizzling]
525000 [scribbling]
525003 What did you do?!
52527c You are about to find out.
525000 [magic zaps]
525000 [magic zaps]
525049 [screaming]
525000 [thump]
525003 Ugh... I don't know what Starlight's up to yet, but we'd better figure it out before it's too late.
525005 Um, Twilight? I think it already is.
525003 [gasps]
525005 Uh, Twilight? Where's your castle?
525003 The map pulled us back, but whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!
525005 But why? And how did we get here? Where's here?
525003 More like when.
525005 What do you mean?
525003 Starlight altered Star Swirl's spell, then somehow used it on the map to travel into the past and change something! Once she did, the map pulled us back to the present!
525005 So we're back where— I mean, when we started?
525003 Not exactly. Everything's different. Look. The map doesn't even make sense anymore! The Crystal Empire takes up half of Equestria!
525005 Plus there's the whole missing castle thing.
525003 Right! This is too big to handle on our own.
525005 You think?
525003 We need to find our friends and get help!
525000 [crow cawing]
525005 I'm gettin' a bad feeling about this, Twilight.
525003 I know, Spike, but this is Ponyville. How bad could things be?
525005 Is that Sugarcube Corner?
525003 I don't understand.
525005 [gasps] [panting] Rarity?
525000 [knocking]
525005 [grunts] Rarity?!
525003 I don't think she's here, Spike. I'm not sure anything we know is the same. But I know one place that could never change!
525000 [sign squeaking]
525000 [machines grinding]
525000 [squeaking]
525000 [machines grinding and hissing]
525000 [rumbling]
525003 Applejack?!
525008 What can I do for you?
525003 It's so good to see you! We couldn't find Pinkie or Rarity or Fluttershy or Rainbow Dash, but I just knew you'd still be here!
525008 Of course I am. This is my home. But who in tarnation is Pinkie Bow and Flutterdash? Or you for that matter?
525003 You... don't know who I am?
525008 Nope. Honestly, the only name I recognize is Rarity, but she left for Manehattan years ago.
525005 Probably to become a world-famous fashion designer, I bet.
525008 Not that I know of. Last I heard, she went to help with the cause like everypony else.
525003 The cause?
525008 The war against King Sombra and the Crystal Empire?
525049 What?!
525008 Where have you two been?
525005 Actually, it's when.
525003 I know this is hard to believe, but you and I and those other ponies I mentioned are friends!
525008 Did you bump your head on a crate of cider or somethin'?
525003 I'm telling you the truth! And if you come with me, I'll prove it.
525008 Well, I'll admit. I've lived in these parts my whole life and I've never seen this before.
525005 There's also supposed to be a castle that goes with it.
525008 But I still don't see what this has to do with you and I bein' friends.
525003 Another pony named Starlight Glimmer used this map to travel through time and change things in the past. For some reason, the map's here but everything else is different!
525008 Different how?
525003 Well, for one thing, where we came from, there's no war with King Sombra. Maybe you could tell us how the war started, then we can figure out when everything changed!
525008 That's easy enough. [sighs] When the Crystal Empire returned, it brought King Sombra back with it.
525000 [flames whooshing]
525008 [voiceover] And it didn't take long for him to force every one of his subjects to fight for him against Equestria.
525000 [marching]
525000 [plane engine noises]
525000 [sounds of battle]
5251a8 [laughs]
525000 [rumbling]
525000 [rapid digging]
525008 [voiceover] And even with Princess Celestia leadin' the charge, it still takes every last pony in Equestria doin' their part, workin' day and night, to keep up the fight.
525000 [train whistle]
525003 I just can't believe it! We stopped King Sombra! You and me and all of our friends!
525008 But we aren't friends. At least not here.
525003 Right.
525008 Look. I hope all this helped, but I really need to get back to cannin' those apples.
525003 Thank you. We're going to set things right.
525008 [sighs] I hope you do.
525005 So... how are we gonna set things right?
525003 I don't know! The only thing we know for sure is that Starlight stopped the rainboom.
525005 And that the map's still here.
525003 [gasps] Spike, that's it! The map is connected to the Tree of Harmony! It must sense that something isn't right! That's why it's still here! I'll just use Starlight's version of the spell and go back a little earlier and stop her before she even knows we're there!
525000 [paper rustling]
525000 [magic zaps]
525000 [magic zaps]
525005 [screaming]
525003 All we have to do now is find Starlight and—
525000 [magic zap]
52527c Well, finding her will be easy! But stopping her's gonna be harder than you think. Sorry to disappoint you, but I created that spell to send myself back in time. So even when you cast it, I still get sent back here. It wasn't difficult to change Star Swirl's spell. He'd already done the hard part. But figuring out I could use the map to go to any time or place and pull you along with me? [short laugh] I even impressed myself with that. I knew you'd try to stop me. You're so predictable. Why else would I leave the scroll behind? Touching it triggered the map to whisk you here and watch me erase the one thing that linked you with your friends! My village was a sanctuary of equality, where nopony's cutie mark allowed them to feel superior! It was a special place, and you and your friends took it away!
525000 [beat]
52527c Now it's my turn to take something special from you! Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bonds! Cutie marks for cutie marks! Sounds like a fair trade to me!
525000 [tok]
525000 [crystal shattering]
525005 Twiliiiiiiight!
525003 Oops!
525005 [screaming] Thanks!
525003 No problem, Spike. At least now we know exactly what we have to do!
525000 [teleportation zaps]
525003 Okay, keep your eyes peeled.
525005 Right!
525003 We have to stop Starlight as soon as Rainbow Dash and those bullies race by!
525005 Um, Twilight?
525003 So be ready.
525005 I know, but—
525003 Because she could pop up anywhere!
525005 Like over there?
525000 [warning noise]
525003 [short gasp]
52527c Just remember how you'd feel if someone said those things to you.
525003 What's going on here?
52527c Oh, I was just reminding these two colts how hurtful teasing can be.
525003 Well, don't!
525312 Huh?
5250b4 Huh?
525003 I mean... you were?
52527c Of course! In a world where everypony is unique, some are bound to feel more special than others. But that isn't a license to be cruel, is it?
525003 No, of course not...
52527c Oh, isn't it a shame we don't live in a world where everypony is equal? No one would ever tease anyone there! Wouldn't that be nice?
525313 Mm-hmm.
525003 No, it wouldn't! I mean, it'd be nice not to be teased, of course, but that's not the same thing!
5250b6 Come on, Fluttershy. Maybe I can help you get through the course this time.
5250b4 Well, I-I sure could use the practice...
525003 I know you only convinced those bullies to not tease Fluttershy to stop the rainboom!
52527c Oh, that's not true. I convinced them not to be bullies because everypony should be equal. Stopping the rainboom is just a bonus.
525000 [whoosh]
525005 Look!
525003 This isn't over yet!
52527c If you say so!
525003 Hi!
5250b7 Um... hi?
525003 You think you can stop for a minute?
5250b7 Sure.
525000 [thump]
525003 I hear you're pretty fast!
5250b7 Pretty fast? Please! I'm even faster than that!
525003 Okay, so, um, hey, you want to race?
5250b7 Um, that wouldn't really be fair. I mean, you're a full-grown pony, and... Wait. Are you an Alicorn?
525003 Come on, I thought you were fast!
525000 [sproing]
5250b7 Uh, actually, I just remembered I have somewhere I need to be.
525003 Okay, listen. You don't have to race me. I just need you to fly fast enough for a sonic rainboom!
5250b7 What?! I can't do that! Nopony can! It's not even a real thing! It's just an old mare's tale!
525003 But it's not! I know it's not! I've seen you do it! In the future!
5250b7 Ooookay... I'm gonna go now.
525003 No! Wait!
52527c Gee, Twilight, what's the matter? Couldn't convince her to do the impossible? That's too bad.
525003 [inhales]
525000 [magic zap]
525000 [clocks ticking]
525000 [magic zaps]
525000 [thud]
525005 Ugh. Well, that didn't work.
525003 This is gonna be harder than I thought. We'll have to try again!
525005 Hey, Twilight?
525003 I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
525005 I don't think you'll have to!
525000 [spears clinking]
525003 Pinkie? Fluttershy?
525007 Silence, changeling!
52500e All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed!
525003 [gulp]
525000 [To be continued...]

526000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
526005 Starlight Glimmer?
526003 I was sure I saw her, Spike!
52627c Welcome home, Twilight!
526005 We traveled back in time to when Rainbow Dash performed her first sonic rainboom?
52627c Without the rainboom, you and your friends will never form your special cutie mark bond!
526003 But whatever Starlight did in the past changed things here!
526003 I don't want to live in that awful future we saw!
526005 I don't think you'll have to.
52600e All servants of Queen Chrysalis found in these woods must be... destroyed!
526003 [gulps]
526000 [theme song]
526003 Wait! We're not changelings! I'm a pony! And he's a dragon!
526007 A likely story! Do something dragonish!
526005 [belches]
526007 [wheezes] That works!
52600e The servants of Chrysalis will do anything to save their evil skins!
526047 Stop! If they are changelings we'll soon see. Though I think they're not what they appear to be.
526003 Zecora! Please, you have to listen.
526047 Beneath this salve, no changeling hides, for it reveals the truth inside.
526000 [ponies gasping]
526007 What does it mean?
526047 The meaning is far worse, I see, for it is we who should not be.
526003 I think I can explain.
526047 I'm sure you can, but let's not talk here. Chrysalis and her army will soon draw near!
526047 The changelings took over not long ago. Though I'll wager in your world that isn't so.
526003 Chrysalis and her army tried to take over Canterlot, but my friends and I stopped her.
526047 Those friends as you know them are not here, alas. But tell me how all this came to pass.
526003 Starlight Glimmer, a pony who traveled back in time to stop my friends and me from ever coming together!
526047 And it is these friends you have in life that keep Equestria free from strife?
526003 I guess so. But this is the second time I've come back and this world is even worse than the last one! If Starlight keeps doing the same thing in the past, how could the present be so different?
526047 Ah. Time is a river, where even the tiniest changes seen can lead to a cascade of effects downstream.
526047 This part of the forest is dark and damp, but it's done well to hide our camp.
526000 [thunk]
526005 This is cozy.
52600d [shrieks] Please! You have to help us!
52600c The changelings attacked Ponyville! We barely escaped with our lives!
526047 The only changeling attack I see is the one that come here looking for me!
526008 It's taken quite a while to find you, Zecora. [laughs]
52619c [laughs] What a lovely village you've chosen to stage your little resistance. It looks absolutely delicious! [slurping] Oh, come now, Zecora. You're vastly outnumbered.
526000 [changeling wings humming]
52619c I know you don't want your charges hurt. Come quietly to the dungeons of Canterlot and I promise to leave the others alone.
52600e Why would she ever trust you?!
526003 Even if there's a chance Chrysalis will honor her word, shouldn't you try?
526047 [hushed] Race to the map while we hold off their attack. Stop Starlight and put the whole world back on track!
52619c Time to make a decision, Zecora!
526047 Even if what you are saying were true, we'd never surrender to a creature like you! [yells]
526000 [sounds of battle, changeling wings]
526003 [panting]
526000 [changeling roars]
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [magic zaps]
52627c Not bad, but it's gonna take a lot more than that!
526003 Lucky for you, there's more where that came from!
526000 [many magic zaps]
52627c You've really gotta work on your aim.
526000 [many magic zaps]
526314 [panting]
526000 [magic zaps]
5260b7 Whoa! [chewing]
526000 [magic zaps]
526003 What are you doing? You have to finish your race!
5260b7 No way! This is way more exciting!
52627c See? You can't stop me no matter what you do.
526000 [magic zaps]
5260b7 Aw, man.
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [thuds]
526049 [groans]
526005 That's strange.
526003 Well, you obviously don't mean us falling, because that's becoming pretty routine.
526005 No, it's just the other times we've come back, it's been day! But look!
526003 Why would the map bring us back to a different time of day than when we left?
526000 [branches cracking]
526005 Um, maybe we should figure it out later!
526000 [timberwolves growling]
526003 [loud panting]
526000 [timberwolves howling]
526003 [gasps] The Castle of the Two Sisters!
526000 [timberwolves howling]
526005 Well, don't just stand here!
526000 [door opens and closes]
526005 This place looks a lot cleaner than I remember.
526003 Rarity?
52600d The castle isn't open for viewings today. The tapestries all need changing. Again.
526005 Rarity, it's me!
52600d I don't socialize with dragons. I don't know anypony who would.
526005 [whimpers]
526003 Rarity, you have to listen to me! The future of Equestria's at stake!
52600d I don't know how you know my name, but I am far too busy to entertain some tourist's ridiculous fantasies.
526003 I have to get back to the map so I can stop Starlight from changing the past, because every present I come to is worse than the last!
526011 Time travel, you say? Now that's something I would like to see.
526011 [laughing] Tell me how you came by this magic to travel through time.
52600c The princess asked you a question! And unless you wanna end up in the dungeon, you'll tell her what she wants to know!
526011 Nopony in my kingdom but me should possess a magic powerful enough to change time.
526005 Your kingdom?
526011 Who else?
526005 Um... Celestia, of course!
526011 [laughing] My sister has been imprisoned in the moon for years! But it is no less a fate than she'd sentence me to! Now, reveal to me the source of this time magic!
526003 ...Alright.
526005 Twilight, no!
526003 We have no choice, Spike. [to Nightmare Moon] I can take you to it, but you'll have to get past the timberwolves.
526011 I am the ruler of all of Equestria. Do you think I can't deal with timberwolves?
526003 No. I know you can.
526011 And if you were thinking of trying to escape...
526000 [chains clinking]
526011 ...it would be very unfortunate for your friend.
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [timberwolf whimpering]
526000 [crunch]
526011 How does it work?
526003 A pony from my time used this spell to travel back and change the past.
526011 And now you will give this spell to me! With it, I will ensure that the Elements of Harmony are never found and my reign lasts forever!
526003 But it won't.
526011 What?!
526003 In my world, my friends and I found the Elements and used them to defeat you! And I will do everything in my power to bring that world back!
526011 No!
526000 [magic zaps]
526011 Noooooo!
526000 [magic zaps]
526003 Now more than ever I know how important it is to stop you!
526000 [crunch]
52627c Well, good luck!
5260b7 Whoooaaaa!
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [crunching]
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [magic zaps]
52627c [clapping]
526000 [squeaks]
526000 [splatting]
526000 [magic zap]
526000 [magic zap]
526000 [sound of machinery]
526000 [magic zap]
526000 [magic zap]
52627c Up for another race-ending fight, Twilight?
526003 No. You were right. I can't stop you.
526000 [magic zap]
526003 But you can't stop me from trying, and we could be stuck doing this for all eternity!
52627c If that's what it takes to keep you and your friends from getting your cutie mark connection, then I'm game!
526000 [magic zap]
526003 What you're doing goes way beyond cutie marks! Everything we do here in the past – even the smallest change – can snowball into an avalanche of trouble for the future!
526000 [magic zap]
52627c Oh, next I suppose you'll tell me that "the fate of all of Equestria hangs in the balance"!
526003 It does!
52627c Spare me your overblown ego! No group of friends, not even Princess Twilight's, is that important!
526000 [magic zap]
5260b7 Aaaaaaah!
526000 [magic zaps]
526003 I don't know how important other ponies' friendships are to the future, but I can show you what the world is like without mine!
526000 [wind blowing]
52627c Where are we?!
526003 The future. Or rather, the present.
52627c But there's nothing here!
526003 I wish I could say I was surprised. But every world I come back to is worse than the last. I don't know why my friends and I are so important to Equestria, but we are.
52627c I don't believe you!
526005 Come on, Starlight, look around!
526003 Like I said, everything in the past affects the future, even the tiniest act. And what you're doing leads here. I know I can't stop you, but I thought showing you this might change your mind.
52627c Change my mind? You don't know anything about me! I was perfectly happy before you and your friends ruined what I built!
526003 I don't know what happened that led you to make your village without cutie marks, and I'm sorry my friends and I had to take it away.
52627c You want to know what happened to me?! I'll show you!
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [clocks ticking]
526003 Where are we?
52627c That map of yours is connected to every part of Equestria, and this part is my home.
526000 [young Starlight Glimmer clapping]
52627c Sunburst and I did everything together. In fact, I don't remember us ever being apart. Until today.
526000 [rumbling]
526000 [myriad thumps]
526315 [whinnies]
526000 [ponies excited]
52627c And just like that, my friend was gone. His family recognized his magical talent and sent him off to Canterlot. I never saw him again.
526005 Well, why not?
52627c Because of his cutie mark! He got his, and I didn't! He moved on, and I didn't! I stayed here and never made another friend because I was too afraid another cutie mark would take them away, too!
526003 That's ridiculous. A cutie mark can't take your friends away.
52627c Not everypony's lucky enough to get her cutie mark at the same time as her friends!
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [magic zaps]
52627c You don't know what it's like to lose a friend because of a cutie mark. But once I stop the rainboom, you will!
526000 [magic zaps]
52627c And when I destroy this scroll, there'll be no way for you to change it!
526000 [paper ripping]
526003 Starlight, you're right! I don't know what you went through! But I do know you can't do this! I've seen where this leads, and so have you!
52627c I only saw what you showed me! Who knows what'll really happen?
526003 I've seen it a dozen times! Things don't turn out well in Equestria without my friends!
52627c Ugh! What's so special about your friends?! How can a group of ponies that are so different be so important?!
526003 The differences between me and my friends are the very things that make our friendship strong!
52627c I thought Sunburst and I were the same. But we turned out different, and it tore our friendship apart!
526003 So try again! Make new friends! And if something that you can't control happens that changes things, work through it together! That's what friendship is! And it's not just my friendships that are important to Equestria! Everypony's are! When yours ended, it led us here. But just imagine all the others that are out there waiting for you if you just give them a chance!
52627c How do I know they won't all end the same way?
526003 I guess it's up to you to make sure they don't.
526000 [whoosh]
526000 [paper rustling]
526000 [boom]
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [magic zaps]
526000 [thumps]
526000 [magic zaps]
526005 [kissing] One Castle of Friendship – check!
526000 [door opens]
52600d What in Equestria was that?!
52600e Is everypony okay?
526007 [squeals] Can you do it again?
526005 One group of amazing friends – check!
526003 Yeah, Spike. It looks like we're home!
526008 Uh... what's she doin' here?
526003 Actually, it's kind of a long story.
526000 [muffled voices]
52600c I mean, I knew my rainboom was awesome, but I never thought all of Equestria depended on it!
526007 Or on us!
526003 I think it's more than that. Friendship connects all of Equestria, and undoing one group of friends made its magic less powerful.
526008 I can't believe y'all were able to travel through time like that.
526007 That Starlight must be pretty magical!
526003 She obviously has more talent for magic than almost anypony I've seen. My magic couldn't stop her. I had to convince her to stop on her own. Once I realized that, everything fell into place.
526008 But if she's as powerful as all that, we can't just send her on her way, can we?
526003 Actually, I kind of have something else in mind.
526000 [door opens]
52627c [gulps, exhales] I know there's no excuse for what I did, but I want you all to know that I'm ready for whatever punishment you think is fair.
526003 I've been thinking a lot about how badly Equestria fared without just one group of friends. Because even when one friendship dies, the results can be disastrous.
52627c I know first-hoof how true that can be.
526003 And that's why I've asked you here. If you're willing to learn, I'm willing to teach you what I know. You'll have the power to make Equestria an even better place.
52627c [hushed] How do I start?
526003 Starting is easy! All you have to do is make a friend! And you've got seven of them right here.
52627c [Starlight Glimmer]
52627c I never thought that I would find a place
52627c To step right in and start again
52627c I never thought that I could just begin
52627c Right where I left off and make a friend
526003 [Twilight Sparkle]
526003 Don't ever think that it might be too late
526003 You don't have to wait, there's no mistakes with the friends you make
526003 A friendship's only made of what you bring
526003 And if you do it right, you can do anything
526000 [Starlight Glimmer and Mane Six]
526000 Just use your eyes
526000 This time, no lies
526000 Just don't disguise
526000 Who you are inside
526000 Because your friends are always there for you
526000 You don't have to be the same for friendship to be true
526000 Because your friends are always there for you
526000 Around the world, it's still the same
526000 Together you have more to gain
526000 There's nothing that a friend won't do
526000 Everywhere you go
526000 Friendship there will grow
526000 When you find it, it's the key
526000 Friends can change the world, you see
526000 Everywhere you go
526000 Friendship there will grow
526000 When you find it, it's the key
526000 Friends can change the world (ah-ah)
526000 Friends can change the world (ah-ah)
526000 Friends can change the world, you see
526000 [credits]
60127c [sighs] Okay. Library... Library... Where did they put the library?
601000 [pause]
60127c [sighs] This castle looked a lot smaller from the outside.
601000 [door opens]
601000 [brushing]
601005 [muffled] Morning, Starlight!
60127c Whoops!
601000 [door shuts]
60127c Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still trying to find my way around. You don't happen to know where the library is, do you?
601005 [muffled] Next door on the left!
60127c Oh. Thanks!
601003 Acceptance, mm-hmm. Altruism, definitely. Starlight, good morning, come in!
60127c Sorry I'm late. I got a little turned around. I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil... after everything I did.
601003 Well, I'm not one to dwell on the past, and neither should you. The castle is your home now, and as far as being my pupil goes, I was just trying to figure out what your first friendship lesson should be!
60127c Oh, well, it looks like you're really narrowing it down!
601003 Oh, these are just the A's. After this, I move on to the B's!
601000 [theme song]
60127c I know I'm just learning about friendship, but I didn't think there were this many lessons for anything. How do we choose?
601003 Maybe I should pare things down a bit before we go through them. Why don't you join the others in the throne room? They're planning our trip to the Crystal Empire when Shining Armor and Princess Cadance have their baby!
60127c Throne room! Got it! [beat] Um, which way is the throne room? [nervous laugh]
601003 [sighs]
60100c Well, I think we should leave ASAP. I don't want to miss the Crystalling!
60100e But, um, shouldn't we wait for the invitation?
601008 Frankly, I'm not exactly clear on all the customs and traditions of the Crystal Empire, especially when it comes to a Crystalling.
60127c What's a Crystalling?
60100d Well, that's just it, darling. Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's baby is due any day, and we're still not sure. The Crystal Empire was gone for a thousand years. A lot of their customs are a bit murky.
601008 We know it's got somethin' to do with the new baby.
601007 [quickly] And a party!
60100e And the Crystal Heart.
601007 [quickly] And a party!
60100c And some kinda cool energy.
601007 And... a party!
601000 [confetti explosion]
601005 It's not hard to understand. Most things in the Crystal Empire aren't. Like how I'm a big hero there, for example!
60100d [stifled giggle]
601005 Eh... plus, I've had to help Twilight do a lot of research on Crystallings. Whenever a baby is born in the Crystal Empire, the parents bring it before the Crystal Heart. They get the purest shard of crystal they can find, then pick a crystaller to present the baby to everypony who comes. Then they all share the light and joy they feel, feeding it into the crystal that joins with the Heart, and increases its power! And this is going to be a royal Crystalling, so pretty much the whole empire will show up. That hasn't happened in a millennia!
60127c What do you mean it increases the Crystal Heart's power?
601005 The energy it uses to protect the Crystal Empire, I guess.
60127c Protect it from what?
601005 I... didn't help Twilight with that part.
601000 [paper rustling]
60127c Hey, Twilight, can I ask you something about the Crystal Empire?
601003 Huh! Funny you should mention it. Because I just narrowed your first friendship lesson down to three options, and one of them is in the Crystal Empire!
60127c Really?
601003 I found out that's where the first pony you ever cared about lives!
60127c Sunburst?
601003 Of course, that's just one idea. We could also go to Griffonstone. [begins fading out] Making friends with a griffon is a challenge all by itself! Or we could tag along with the CMC's the next time they try to help a pony figure out why they're special...
601000 [high-pitched ringing]
601003 [normal] Starlight? Is something wrong?
60127c What? O-Oh, no, heh, those all sound great!
601003 I know! I guess you were right – it is gonna be hard to choose one!
60127c [laughs nervously] ...Yeah.
601000 [door opens]
601000 [clatter]
601000 [magic noises]
601000 [door closes]
601000 [door opens]
601000 [beat]
60127c Ugh! I am never gonna find my way around this place!
601005 Gee, Starlight, what's wrong?
60127c I don't know, Spike. Twilight's figuring out what my first friendship lesson is, and I guess I'm not exactly thrilled with the options. Well... with one of them.
601005 Which one?
60127c Reuniting me with my first friend.
601005 What's so terrible about that?
60127c [sighs] [narrating] When we were foals, Sunburst knew everything there was to know about magic. He always knew just what to do. And he was always there to help me. I guess it's not surprising that Sunburst got his cutie mark in magic and... went off to Princess Celestia's school. But when he left...
601005 You blamed cutie marks and stripped a whole village of theirs, and when Twilight and the others stopped you, you went back in time and almost destroyed Equestria.
601000 [poof]
60127c Not really stuff I'm super eager to tell Sunburst about. I mean, he's probably some big important wizard now, and... I can't even find my way around Twilight's castle.
601005 Well, if Sunburst is that good at magic, maybe he'd appreciate your, uh... [clears throat] exploits. You should talk to Twilight about it. I'm sure she'd want to hear what you have to say.
60127c I know. But I don't want her to think I'm not ready to learn or that I'm not grateful for everything she's doing.
601003 Spike! Come quick!
601000 [wind blowing]
601005 It's a Crystalling invitation!
601003 Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt! Well, this settles it! Since we're going to the Crystal Empire, your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!
60127c Great...
601000 [train whistle]
60100c [yawn] Um, Applejack, what is that?
601008 Oh, just a little somethin' for the young'un. Made from genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple trees. We make 'em for all the Apples, and anypony related to Twilight is practically family.
60100c Yeah, it's okay... But it's no Cloudsdale mobile! Bam!
60101e Ooh!
601007 Pretty!
601000 [shatter]
601008 Well, a mobile is real nice... as long as you have somethin' to lay in so you can look at it.
60100d And a fetching blanket to keep you warm.
601003 I'm sure Shining Armor and Princess Cadance will love all our gifts. But I think they're more happy we'll be attending the baby's Crystalling.
601007 Ooh! I can't wait to see all that light and love make the Crystal Heart even more sparkly and shiny!
601003 Actually, Pinkie, the Crystal Heart is an ancient and powerful relic. Without its magic, the Crystal Empire would be lost to the Frozen North.
60127c Wow, this Crystalling sounds pretty important. I'd understand if you wanted to... you know... wait to do a different friendship lesson when we get back.
601003 Are you kidding? This trip is perfect! Not only do I get to see the baby and take part in the ceremony that helps maintain the magic of the Crystal Empire, but I'm starting my new pupil off with the most amazing friendship lesson ever! I can't wait!
60127c Right... Me neither... [beat] Actually, Twilight, I am a little worried about meeting Sunburst.
601003 Oh, trust me. I know what it's like to see old friends. But I'll be right there to help things along. I've broken the whole lesson down into a few easy steps to ensure this reunion goes off without a hitch!
60127c [laughs nervously]
601000 [train chuffing]
601003 [reading] Step one, head to Sunburst's house and get you two started on the right hoof. Step two, get to the castle with enough time to visit the ba—
601000 [thump]
601003 [gasps] Shining Armor!
601193 [tired] Twilight...!
601003 I didn't know you were meeting us!
601193 [tired] Of course I am! It's me, right here. Here I am. Why wouldn't I come meet my sister? Though we have met before, heh-heh...
601003 Are you all right?
601193 [tired] Never better! Being a father is amazing! And wonderful, and amazing, and confusing, and amazing, but surprising too, you know? I mean, not that you'd know. You wouldn't know, I know... You know? [beat] Sorry. I haven't really slept since Cadance had the baby. Come to think of it, she hasn't either. It sure would be great to get a break.
601003 Oh, of course! I don't know what I was thinking! You two probably need all kinds of help! I'm sorry, Starlight, but I guess combining your first lesson with this visit wasn't such a good idea.
60127c Oh, uh, don't be ridiculous! You're an aunt now! That's way more important than some friendship lesson.
601003 I just wish there was a way to do both.
601005 Maybe there is! You've already done the work for Starlight's lesson with this list. All we have to do is follow it!
601003 Spike, you're a genius!
60127c [through nervous laugh] Yeah... [through gritted teeth] genius.
601003 Then it's settled! Shining Armor and I will head straight to the castle, and you two can head straight to Sunburst's!
601005 Aye-aye, Princess!
60127c [nervously] Uh-huh.
601003 Alright, big brother, let's go see this amazing baby pony!
601193 [snoring] Ahhh... the baby...
601005 I know you're a little worried about this reunion, but I'm sure Twilight's got everything covered.
60127c Everything except how I'd rather do absolutely anything else.
601005 Oh, I bet she's taken that into account too. It's all part of the lesson. Trust the lesson.
60127c Right... [beat] Hey, i-is that... you?
601005 Oh, yep, it sure is! Now, according to the list, Sunburst's house is—
60127c Why is there a statue of you in the Crystal Empire?
601316 Because Spike the Brave and Glorious saved all of us from King Sombra!
601317 And then again during the Equestria Games!
60127c Really?
601318 Really! [to Spike] Big fan.
60127c Um, when were you going to tell me about this?
601005 Nah, it's no big deal.
6011b0 It most certainly is!
60127c That's it! We're not going anywhere until I get the whole story!
601193 Before we go in, I should probably tell you. Seeing the baby might be a bit of a shock.
601003 Come on, big brother. I've met babies before. I expect meeting this one won't be any different. [gasps]
601319 [coos]
601003 Of course, I could be wrong.
601319 [burbling]
601003 The baby is an Alicorn?!
601198 [tired] It looks that way.
60100d But... But... But I thought Alicorn wings had to be earned by accomplishing some great, princess-worthy deed!
601008 Yeah. How can you just be born with 'em?
601019 The birth of an Alicorn is something Equestria has never seen!
60101a It is beyond even our understanding.
60100e [hushed] That's not very reassuring.
601007 Wow! A unicorn, and a Pegasus! So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!
60100c Well, I know all about super-strong flying!
601003 And I can help keep tabs on her magic!
601319 [sneezes] [burbles]
601019 It appears her magic is more powerful than that of a newborn unicorn!
60101a The crowds have already started to gather.
601007 [inhales] [blows balloon] This Crystalling is gonna be some party!
601000 [balloon pops]
601198 Do you think we should call it off?
60100c Um, we've all faced a lot worse than baby magic.
60100d I can't imagine cancelling such a beautiful and important ceremony over something so potentially adorable!
60106d [general agreement]
601019 In light of the little one's abilities, this Crystalling might be more important than ever. [to Cadance] Perhaps you should address your subjects and remind them of that.
601198 Hm. [kisses]
601319 [baby noise]
601193 [snoring]
601003 Shining Armor! Do you have everything you need for the ceremony?
601193 [tired] Huh? Oh, no! I still have to interview the honor guards, choose the purity crystal, and pick a crystaller!
601003 Alright, take it easy. Pinkie can stay here with me and keep an eye on the baby.
601007 [squee]
601319 [giggles]
601008 And we'll all help you with everythin' else.
601193 [snores] ...baby...
60100d That is, if you can stay awake long enough to tell us how.
601005 ...and that's how we found the Crystal Heart, defeated King Sombra, and saved the Empire.
601000 [Crystal Ponies cheering]
60131a We love you, Spike!
60131b Yeah. Tell the one about the Equestria Games!
601005 Well, as much as I love reliving my heroic deeds, Starlight and I have an important lesson to do, by order of the Princess of Friendship!
6010f3 Awwww!
60127c Aw, come on, Spike! I want to hear about the Games too!
601000 [scribbling]
601005 I know you're nervous about seeing Sunburst, but it says right in step 3, to, uh, "Deal with your fears by facing them, not by putting it off."
60127c Ugh. Let's go get this over with.
601005 Wait!
60127c Huh? What?!
601005 Knocking on the door isn't the next thing on the list!
60127c Seriously?
601005 I know Twilight can be a little nitpicky, but this is your first lesson as her pupil, and it's important that we do it right!
60127c Fine. What's the next thing on the list?
601005 [clears throat] [reading] "Before they see each other, be sure to highlight the importance of the meeting."
60127c I'm pretty sure we can skip that.
601005 I don't know... I mean if we skip it, the whole lesson could go south! And then you might end up taking a giant step backwards instead of forwards! Maybe you'll never be able to learn anything about friendship at all! It's almost like your whole future depends on this moment. [beat] "Highlight the importance of the meeting" – check! I can't believe you wanted to skip that!
601000 [knocking]
601000 [long beat]
601000 [door opens]
60127c Sunburst?
601315 Yes? What can I do for you?
60127c It's... It's me, Starlight. We used to be friends?
601315 [beat] Oh, of course! S-Starlight! My goodness, it-it's been a long time! What, uh, what have you been up to?
60127c Me? Oh! You know, some of this, some of that, different... stuff. Right now, I'm sort of Twilight Sparkle's new pupil.
601315 The Princess of Friendship?
60127c Heh... yeah... that's actually kind of why I'm here. I mean, I know you're probably very busy.
601315 What do you mean?
60127c Well, I figured after magic school, you'd go on to do important wizard work, but...
601315 Oh. No. Y-Yes! Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard! Really busy with lots of, uh, wi-wizarding... stuff. [beat] Right. Uh, well... good to see you.
601000 [door closes]
601005 Huh. Maybe we should have skipped highlighting the importance of the meeting after all.
60127c Well, I guess that's that!
601005 Starlight, come on! We have to at least explain what Twilight wants!
60127c [groans]
601000 [knocking]
601000 [door opens]
601198 [tired, amplified] Dearest citizens, I am sure you are all just as thrilled and ready for this Crystalling as myself and Shining Armor.
601000 [crowd cheering]
601193 [panicked breathing] I'm not ready!
60100c Take it easy! Just pick whoever looks the most like honor guard material.
601193 Right... right.
601000 [thump]
601006 [whimpering]
601193 I'm sorry. Fatherhood is way more stressful than I ever thought.
60100e I can only imagine.
60100d Now, I know choosing the crystal of purity is a very important decision. So I have gone through the trouble of arranging them in order from incredibly pure to outrageously pure.
60100e Um, Rarity, don't they all sort of look the same?
60100d Oh, well, to the untrained eye, perhaps. What do you think, Shining Armor?
601193 [incoherent stammering] I don't know!
60100d [hushed] I hope Twilight and Pinkie are having better luck with the baby!
601319 [burbling]
601007 Well... at least she's having... fun!
601000 [magic zaps]
601007 Whee!
601003 Pinkie, hold her still!
601007 I'm tryiiiiiiing!
601315 So... the Princess of Friendship wants you and I to be friends again?
60127c Heh, I know. Weird, right?
601315 Uh, I don't understand. Did something happen to you after I left for magic school?
60127c What?
601000 [thump]
60127c No! I-I don't see what that has to do with anything. W-Why would you even ask that?
601000 [tea pouring]
60127c I mean, did something happen to you after you left for magic school?
601315 What? Um, no. L-Like you said, I'm a, [clears throat] i-important wizard.
601005 I'm sure there's something on Twilight's list that can help here.
601193 [heavy breathing]
601000 [door opens]
601193 Okay. I chose the honor guard, picked the purity crystal, and I know exactly who I want to be our crystaller. So, all we need is...
601198 The baby?
601000 [beat]
601003 We're here!
601319 [burbling]
601007 She's a really strong flyer!
601000 [magic bubbling]
601319 [sniffling] [loud crying]
601000 [cracking]
601000 [shattering]
601213 [gasps]
601319 [burbling]
601008 I'm guessin' that's gonna make it harder to do the Crystalling.
601003 It's worse than that. Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!
601319 [burbles]
601000 [To be continued...]
601000 [jaunty music over credits]
602000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
60227c I still can't believe you're letting me stay here... as your pupil.
602003 Shining Armor's a father! I'm an aunt!
602003 Your first friendship lesson is going to be... reuniting with Sunburst!
602315 Uh, y-yes, that's me, yup. [nervous chuckle] Important wizard!
602003 The baby is an Alicorn?!
602007 So she could be a super-strong flyer and have crazy baby magic!
602000 [shattering]
602003 Without the Heart, the Crystal Empire's about to be buried under a mountain of ice and snow!
602213 [gasps]
602000 [theme song]
60200d So... not only can we not take part in a fabulous ancient ceremony, but we're also about to be frozen solid!
602003 Without the Crystal Heart's magical protection, the entire city's about to become a winter wasteland!
602008 But what about when King Sombra ruled the Crystal Empire and the Crystal Heart was missin'? The city wasn't covered in snow then!
602003 The Heart wasn't missing. It was still in the castle. King Sombra had just hidden it.
602019 I'm afraid Twilight is correct, and the storm clouds are already forming.
602000 [lightning cracks]
60200c I can totally fly up there and bust those puppies! No problem!
602019 I wouldn't advise it, Rainbow Dash. Those storm clouds are not like the ones you know.
60201a This far north, the weather has a will of its own, and now it will only grow stronger, enveloping everything in its path.
602198 Including the Crystal Empire!
602003 And us along with it!
602005 There's gotta be somethin'...
602315 I know Princess Twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship, but... it's been so long. I don't see how anything on that list is going to help.
60227c I know, right? It's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off.
602315 Well, actually, there's several. Mistmane's Material Amity, Rockhoof's Rapport, Flash Prance's Fellow... ship... [ahem] But I-I get the feeling the princess isn't looking for a spell.
60227c [chuckle] Definitely not.
602005 Got it! [reading] "And if all else fails, ask them to share an embarrassing moment from their past, maybe even something they regret!"
602000 [beat]
602315 Uh, I don't see how that would help.
60227c Uh, yeah! We should just get out of your mane. It's pretty obvious this isn't going how Twilight hoped, and I'm sure you have plenty of important work to do...
602315 What? Oh! Right, yes, heh-heh! Uh, no rest for the wizardly.
60227c Come on, Spike.
602005 [groans]
602000 [door closes]
602000 [wind blowing]
602003 There must be a spell that can restore the Crystal Heart!
602019 Perhaps.
60201a But it isn't something that either of us know.
602198 The library here at the castle is nearly as extensive as the one in Canterlot. There's a good chance we can find something there!
602003 Can you hold off the storm?
60201a Yes, for a time, but even our magic will eventually succumb to the power of the Frozen North.
602019 We will do what we can, but you must hurry.
602000 [magic zaps]
602003 I don't know how long it will take to find the right spell, but you should probably tell the crowd outside to get somewhere warm!
602198 And try not to mention the Crystal Heart. We don't want to start a panic.
602008 Yes, ma'am. C'mon, girls!
602003 I'm gonna need all of your help. The crystal library is enormous!
602193 You can count on us, Twily!
602319 [giggles]
602000 [magic pop]
602007 [shrieks]
602000 [magic pop]
602193 Where'd she go?!
602319 [distant giggling]
602198 This way!
60227c Well, Spike, looks like my biggest fears came true. I wouldn't be surprised if Twilight decides to give up on me entirely.
602005 Aw, it's not your fault. I'm the one who said all we needed was this list. [blows fire]
60227c It's not the list, Spike. Or you. Or Twilight. I'm the one Sunburst doesn't want to be friends with.
602005 I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.
60227c He didn't have to say it.
602005 Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with! And I do too!
60227c Thanks, Spike. At least I have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath.
602005 [exhales] Uh, that's not dragon breath. It's freezing!
60227c Oh, you're right! But I thought the Crystal Heart was supposed to keep the cold weather out.
602005 It is... unless something's happened! Come on!
60200c We're just saying that it might not be the best idea to stay outside!
60231c I camped out all night for this spot! I'm not about to just give it up!
60200e Still, when you think about it, the view is just as good a little further back, like... inside your house?
602000 [Crystal Ponies complaining]
60231d The Crystalling ceremony is one of our most sacred traditions! And when that foal is held before the Crystal Heart, I plan to be as close to the action as possible!
602008 Honestly, I don't know if there's gonna be a Crystallin'. The truth is, the baby's an Alicorn and her magic's plum crazy, so you might not wanna be that close after all.
60231c A baby Alicorn? Wow, I can't wait to see that!
60231d Oh, those little wings are probably so cute!
60231e I know, right?
60200c Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling isn't happening.
602000 [magic zaps]
60231e No Crystalling, huh? Then why are they starting the fireworks show?
602000 [Crystal Ponies cheering]
602319 [giggling throughout]
602193 Young filly... come back here!
602007 Come to your Auntie Pinkie Pie!
602003 Bridle Buck's Boat Chants, Hayhoof's Intonements, Mystic Maps and Mazes... [groans] Anything up there?
602000 [magic pop]
602198 Not yet! I'm not even sure how these are organized!
602000 [magic pop]
602319 [giggling] [sneezes]
602000 [magic pops]
602198 Shining Armor, I thought you were taking care of the baby!
602193 I'm trying!
602000 [magic pops]
602319 Whoo!
60200d Gotcha!
602000 [magic pops]
60200d Oh! Or not...
602319 [continued giggling]
602000 [continued magic zaps]
602007 Whoa!
602000 [crash]
60227c What is going on?!
602007 You want the long or the short version?
60227c Short?
602007 [quickly] The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow.
60227c Oh.
602000 [crunch]
602198 [gasps] What about this? Trotter's Tome of Reliquary?
602000 [pages turning]
602003 I think this is it!
602198 [reading] "Spell of Relic Reconstitution"! I can't believe we found it!
602003 It's a good thing, too! Without this, I don't know what we'd do!
602000 [magic pop]
602319 [giggling]
602000 [thump]
602000 [magic zaps]
602003 [gasps]
602007 Oops.
602003 That spell was the only thing we found in the whole library that was even close to what we needed!
60227c I'm so sorry, Twilight!
602003 It's not your fault, Starlight. None of us were expecting any of this.
602198 Do you think you can remember the spell?
602003 I only read it through once!
60200d Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight.
602003 I'll try. But I'm not sure how long it'll take.
602000 [wind blowing]
602007 Is quickly an option?
602198 I'll help if I can, but we should evacuate the city just in case! You need to lead everypony to the train station before the tracks freeze over!
602193 We will. But between you and Twilight, I'm sure you'll remember the spell.
602000 [door opens]
602003 I only hope this spell is the one we need.
60227c Is there anything I can do?
602003 I don't think so. I'm just sorry about your lesson.
60227c Oh, that doesn't matter now. Sunburst and I don't have anything in common anyway. He's a big important wizard! And I'm re-learning everything I ever thought I knew.
602198 Sunburst? I don't recognize the name, but if he's an important wizard, you should bring him here. Maybe he'll know what to do if the spell fails.
60227c [gasps] Of course!
602003 You better go with her, Spike.
602000 [thunder cracks]
602000 [magic zaps]
602000 [door opens]
60227c [straining] Sunburst! Haven't you looked outside?!
602315 Snow? That's... not right. The Crystal Heart—
60227c Is gone! The baby – Shining Armor and Cadance's baby – it's an Alicorn!
602315 Really?
60227c Really! And her magic is a little berserk, and well, I guess she destroyed the Heart! But Twilight thinks she can fix it and Princess Cadance thought you could help!
602315 Me?
60227c Of course! You're an important wizard in the Crystal Empire! It just makes sense!
602315 Right... right... right right right. You know, I'd like to help, I-I really would. I-I just have so much, um, important wizard work to do around here.
60231f Huh?!
602000 [wind howling]
602008 You can't stay here!
60231e Did I mention this was a Royal Crystalling? When the crystaller holds the young one aloft, all of the Empire will share their joy and light, and the Crystal Heart will beat stronger than it ever has before!
60231d It really is a moving ceremony!
60200e I really don't think it's going to happen.
60200c Come on, it's freezing out here!
60231c Uh, this is the Crystal Empire. We've seen snow before.
602193 Not like this! We don't have time to argue! Princess Cadance has decided to evacuate the city!
602000 [crowd gasps]
60231e But the Crystalling...!
602193 I don't know if we'll ever have another Crystalling again! The Crystal Heart... is shattered.
602000 [crowd gasps]
60231c It's not safe here!
602008 [groan] That's what we've been tryin' to tell you!
60227c Sunburst, I know you're busy, but did you hear what I said?
602315 Oh, I heard you, but-but like I said, when you're an important wizard, the work just piles up.
60227c Sunburst!
602315 [sighs] Look, Starlight, I want to help. I do. But I can't. I wish I could.
60227c What do you mean?!
602315 Fixing an ancient relic? I-I can't even come close to doing something like that!
60227c But I thought you were an important wizard!
602315 Well, you were wrong, okay?! I'm not an important wizard! I'm not even a wizard at all!
602315 I know it's hard for you to understand, but not all of us end up achieving greatness.
60227c What? Why wouldn't I understand that?
602315 Really? You're the protégé of the Princess of Friendship! I don't think she picks just anypony for that!
602005 Technically, she's more of a student than a protégé.
602315 Whatever. I'm sorry I'm not the big important wizard you were expecting.
60227c Sunburst, I don't care if you're a wizard or not. I'm just surprised. You always knew so much about magic. I mean, look at all these books!
602315 Yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school! To know so much and not be able to do any of it!
60227c Well, you don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends!
602000 [long beat]
602315 Did you really travel through time?
602005 See? I told you he'd be impressed.
602315 I'm sorry we lost touch. Maybe if I had reached out, you could have helped me at magic school, and I could have helped you to...
60227c Not become totally evil? [sighs] Let's just say I know what it's like to have something you're not exactly proud of.
602315 When you showed up thinking I was some big wizard... I'm sorry. I should have told you the truth.
60227c It's fine. At least we worked it all out. I think Twilight would be proud of us.
602005 Well, if you ever want to tell her about it, we should probably leave now!
60227c [gasps] I forgot to tell you! They're evacuating the city! You need to get to the train station, unless you've got a spell here that will drive back the Frozen North and fix the Crystal Heart so the baby can have her Crystalling?
602315 Crystalling...! Of course!
602000 [magic zaps]
602268 [straining]
602019 Push them back, my sister!
602000 [ponies panicking]
602193 This way!
602000 [thud]
60200c Ugh!
602008 Just a little bit further, y'all! The station's just ahead!
60227c We have to go back!
602315 I know how to stop this!
602000 [scribbling]
602003 Uh, I think that's everything?
602198 It looks right to me, but... there's only one way to find out!
602000 [magic zaps, shards tinkling]
602000 [shattering]
602003 The spell failed. I don't know what else to do.
602019 An old student of mine believes he does.
602315 The baby did this?!
602003 I tried putting it back together with—
602315 The spell of Relic Reconstitution. No, that won't do it. The Crystal Heart's been around for millennia. Restoring a relic like this is way beyond one spell. You need to combine it with something else. Something unique to the relic itself. Something that strengthens it and provides it with power...?
602000 [beat]
602003 The Crystalling!
602315 Combining that spell with the light and love of everypony gathered for the ceremony, together with... Somnambula's Weather Abjuration to clear away the snow... and a little Fledgling's Forbearance for the parents... Heh. That should curb the little one's power fluctuations.
602319 [giggles]
602198 You must be Sunburst. Starlight said you were a powerful wizard.
602315 Oh, I'm no wizard.
6020ea [gasps]
60200c What?
60227c But he studied magic his whole life! You should see his house! And since nopony has any better ideas, what do we have to lose?!
602193 I had planned on asking Twilight to be our crystaller, but since it seems like she'll be busy...
602315 I'd be honored!
602319 [giggling]
602003 Well, what are we waiting for?!
602000 [magic zaps, shards tinkling]
602003 [straining]
602000 [magic zaps]
602000 [wind blowing]
602000 [magic shimmering]
602319 [giggling]
602315 Citizens! May I present the newest member of the Crystal Empire!
602319 [laughs]
602000 [crowd cheers]
60231e She's beautiful!
60231d Oh! It's just so moving!
602000 [magic noises]
602319 [giggles]
602000 [Crystal Ponies cheering]
602000 [magic zap]
60231c Best Crystalling ever!
60227c For a pony who isn't great at magic, you did pretty well.
602019 Indeed. I'm glad to see you've found a way to share your unique gift, Sunburst. You may be more of a wizard than you think.
602320 You would not believe the crazy weather that delayed our train. Came out of nowhere.
602321 But it was all worth it to see this peaceful little angel! Awww, so sweet! Come to your grandmare!
602319 [giggles]
602008 Yeah, peaceful now, anyway.
602003 I suppose that spell really did the trick!
602319 [inhales for sneeze]
602012 [shrieks]
602319 [sneezes]
602000 [beat]
602193 We have Sunburst to thank for that.
602198 I hope he takes his role as crystaller seriously. Something tells me the baby will need a pony like him to look to for magical advice.
602321 Cadance, darling, aren't we gonna name the poor little dear, or are we gonna spend our entire visit just calling her "the baby"?
602198 We were thinking... "Flurry Heart".
602193 You know, to remember the occasion.
60200d Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget?
602003 I think it's lovely. [kisses]
602319 [giggles]
60227c Well, I think you're the Crystal Empire's big important wizard, whether you like it or not.
602315 I don't know if I'll have time for any wizarding. I'm a crystaller now. That's a big responsibility.
60227c I can't think of anypony more qualified. Just... promise you'll stay in touch?
602315 Hm, like I'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend.
602005 What's wrong, Twilight?
602003 I don't know, Spike. I think I have a lot to learn about being a teacher.
602005 What are you talking about? Your lesson went perfectly! Starlight and Sunburst got over their past and rekindled their friendship!
602003 No thanks to me. I know a lot happened. I just wish I could have given my pupil the attention she deserves.
602005 Well, I know she needed to be put on the right path, but giving her the space to make her own decisions worked pretty well. Isn't that how Celestia taught you?
602003 You know, I never thought about it! But I guess it is!
602005 Maybe you're a better teacher than you thought.
602000 [train chuffing]
602000 [triumphant music over credits]
603000 [train chuffing]
603007 [singsong] We're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan, we're going to Manehattan...!
60300d [nonplussed] Yes, yes, Manehattan, the height of sophistication, elegance, culture... Since my boutique in Canterlot has been doing so nicely, it only makes sense for me to open one there as well.
603007 [squeals] We're almost there! Why doesn't your face look like this?! Eee...
60300d Oh, Pinkie, dear, this is just a business trip for me. I need to scour the city for the most perfect location for my new shop. And while it's lovely how excited you are, there's absolutely no chance of me getting swept into the– [gasps] [suddenly excited] energy, the beauty, the majesty of the greatest city in all of Equestria!
603000 [doors open]
60300d [sighs] This city's simply a-ma-zing! It's just... everything, ever!
603007 And it's about to get everything ever-er! Because guess who I see! M-A-U-D! You know what that spells?
603242 [deadpan] It spells Maud.
603007 [squee]
603000 [party cannon fires]
603007 Maud, Maud, Maud! Yay!
603000 [theme song]
60300d Oh, you Pie sisters have just about the sweetest family traditions! Every year, you set aside a special day to spend with each of your sisters?
603007 Yep! I do separate trips with each one, and we make it super fun by picking a different location every year! We see the sights all day and then swap gifts at sunset! And since Maud's getting her rocktorate nearby, we figured this would be the perfect spot for PSSSD!
60300d [hushed] Okay, what's the secret?
603007 Huh?
60300d You just said 'pssst'.
603007 No, silly! Not pssst, PSSSD! P-S-S-S-D! Pie Sisters Surprise Swap Day!
603000 [stallion snorts]
603007 [giggles nervously]
60300d Maud!
603242 [deadpan] Boulder promised his cousin a postcard.
60300d Well, I'll just leave you two to your PSSSD. And now, I am off to scout possible locations for my new boutique!
603007 Before you go, can I ask you a quick question?
60300d Oh, of course.
603007 [loudly] Will you please help me?!
60300d [nervously] Only if you let go of my leg and stand up...
603007 Every year, Maud's PSSSD gift always blows mine away! But this year is going to be different! For the first time, I'm finally getting her a gift that's as good as the one she always gets me! There's a specialty store here in Manehattan that sells nothing but rock pouches! A rock pouch would be perfect for Boulder, and I know Maud will love it!
60300d Why, Pinkie, that really is the perfect gift for Maud!
603007 I know, right? Problem is, I still need to buy one, and the store is downtown!
60300d Hmm, and you want to get a pouch for Maud without ruining the surprise... Well, luckily for you, I know exactly what you should do! Why not sight-see on a path that leads right to the pouch store? That way Maud won't get suspicious! I'll come with you to distract Maud, so...
603007 ...I can sneak away to pick out a rock pouch! [gasps] And if you're coming with us, you can look at boutique locations along the way! [shouting] It's the perfect plan! [echoes out]
60300d Y-Yes, yes, yes, let's not get too excited until you actually get a pouch for Maud.
603007 Of course. Got it. Absolutely.
603242 [deadpan] Nothing moved him.
603007 Maud! I'm giving you the greatest PSSSD gift in the history of ever!
603000 [party cannon fires]
60300d Oh, what a spectacular view! You really can see everything from here!
603242 [deadpan] Especially the glaciation of the sloping strata. It's breathtaking.
603007 But not half as breathtaking as the gift I'm giving you!
603000 [party cannon fires]
60300d I-It certainly is– [grunts] –cozy... but this simply won't do! Working in a space this small would make me lose my mind!
603007 Just like Maud's gonna lose her mind when she sees the gift I'm giving her!
603000 [party cannon fires]
603000 [skating sounds]
60300d [inhales]
603007 Whatever you were about to say isn't nearly as good as the gift I'm giving Maud!
603000 [party cannon fires]
603242 [deadpan] You'll be pleased with yours too.
603000 [drawing noises]
60300d Pinkie, put down that crayon! The Cantering Cook isn't that kind of restaurant!
603007 [spits]
603000 [splash]
60300d Oh... A pony could get used to eating at places like this!
603242 [deadpan] I know. It's the only restaurant in the city with nepheline syenite in their bathroom tiles.
60300d [stutters] ...Well, isn't that something! [deliberately] You know what, Pinkie Pie? Uh, maybe you could help me figure out what to order!
603007 [hushed] We're so close to the pouch store! It's just a block away! I could practically smell it from here! If I knew what a pouch store smelled like.
603000 [beat]
60300d [hushed] Okay, remember the plan. I will stay here and distract Maud while you go get a pouch!
603007 [hushed] Gotcha!
60300d [deliberately] Oh, why, thank you for the kind assistance, Pinkie Pie. And now I know exactly what to order.
603007 [deliberately] You are very welcome, Rarity! Now pardon me whilst I go wash my hooves!
603000 [thump]
603007 Sorry!
60300d So, Maud... that Boulder of yours is such an interesting... ahem... character. You must tell me, how did the two of you first meet?
603242 [deadpan] It was a dark and stormy night. Little did I know that my life was about to change forever.
603000 [cash register rings]
603007 [gasps] Look at that hand-stitched ten-thousand-thread-count velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud will love it! I need it!
603000 [crash]
603007 Ungh! Huh, must be stuck! [reading] "Took a sudden vacation to Canterlot with my grandniece. Back in a few moons." Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no-no! Well, maybe, just maybe, he's already back from vacation and just forgot to take the sign down! [shouting and pounding on door] Hello, Mr Pouch Store Owner! I'd like to hear all about your sudden vacation in Canterlot with your grandniece while buying a pouch for my sister please!
603322 Miss, the store's clearly closed.
603007 But it can't be. It just can't be! If I can't get that pouch... then not only am I not getting my sister the greatest present in the history of PSSSD, but now I have no PSSSD present for my sister at all!
603000 [door opens]
603242 [deadpan] ...and Boulder's been by my side ever since.
60300d [deadpan] Wow. What a surprisingly suspenseful and compelling story. I completely get what you see in him now. [gasps] Pinkie Pie, you're back! [deliberately] Oh, your hooves must be sparkling clean!
603007 Huh? Oh, right. [sighs]
603000 [beat]
60300d Garçon! One super-deluxe two-mile-high hot fudge sundae, stat!
603000 [thump]
60300d What happened? Did you get a pouch for Maud? Tell me everything!
603007 [inhales] [quickly] The door to the rock pouch store is locked because the owner's on a sudden vacation to Canterlot with his grandniece for a few moons, and so there's no way I can get the perfect present for Maud, and now I don't have any present for her at all, so it'll be the worst Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day ever! [inhales]
603000 [splat]
603007 [muffled sobbing]
60300d Oh, not to worry, dear! I'll just have to help you find a new present for Maud. We have plenty of time before your gift exchange at sunset and all of Manehattan to explore. We're bound to find something Maud would like. Maybe even more than a rock pouch!
603007 You're right! Thanks, Rarity!
603000 [My Little Pony theme on piano interrupted by upwards glissando]
60300d Maud, I can't help but notice you're staring at that marvelous giraffe. I was just wondering, any chance you could see yourself with it?
603242 [deadpan] Only if I had a mirror.
60300d Now, Maud, I know you're a big fan of rocks, so get your camera ready, because these are the most spectacular rocks in all of Manehattan! Surely there must be something here that catches your eye.
603242 [deadpan] [hushed] Boulder says they're all too... stuck-up.
603000 [Western-themed music]
60300d [whistles] All right. You and me, Maud, you and me. What do you think about... this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? Or this? This? This? This? This? This? [repeats, accelerating into gibberish]
603242 [deadpan] I like... that.
60300d What is it? You have to tell me! Was it this bike? This lamp? This grappling hook? What do you like?!
603242 [deadpan] I like that fissure in the sidewalk. It's an elegant example of thermal expansion and soil settlement.
603000 [camera flashes]
603000 [sound of kettle boiling]
60300d Fissure in thhhhhhhe soil...? What?! But I...! All of this...! And she likes a crack?!
603000 [pop]
603007 Did she like anything?
60300d [hushed] That sister of yours is simply impossible to shop for! There's nothing she needs or wants!
603242 [deadpan] [calling out] Boulder. Boulder. Where'd you run off to? There you are. Sure wish I had something to carry you around in.
603007 A rock pouch was the perfect gift for Maud! Aw, and I know she would have loved the one I saw in the window! It had double stitching, a red drawstring...
60300d ...and ochre-flecked velvet lining with reinforced triple-crosshatched seams?
603007 Yep, that's the pouch. [beat] Wait, how'd you know?
60300d Because I'm looking at one just like it! Maybe if you can catch up with him, you could ask—
603000 [zoom]
603007 Excuse me, sir! I couldn't help but notice your nifty rock pouch! Is there any chance you'd be willing to part with it? I really need it. Like, really really really!
603323 So lemme get this straight - You, uh, really really need this pouch, huh?
603007 I believe I said really really really.
603323 Well, you know, pouches like this are really hard to come by these days. But I might be able to part with it for the right price.
603007 So you'll sell it to me? And I'll finally be able to give my sister the perfect Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day present? Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
603000 [party cannon fires]
603323 Hmmm. That's one sweet party cannon you got there. Tell you what. I'd be more than happy to give you the pouch for the low, low price of... that cannon.
603007 [gasps] M-My... party cannon...?
603323 Well, if you really wanna give that sister of yours the perfect present, then you'll have to give up your party cannon. So, what do you say? The pouch for the cannon.
603000 [ding]
603242 [deadpan] Do you see the exposed chalcedony in the fissure?
60300d Probably?
603007 [despondent] What you guys lookin' at?
60300d Oh, you're back! [to Maud] Darling, I want to get one more picture of you with that astounding fissure in the sidewalk, and the inspiration just struck me for the perfect shot! Uh, be a dear and go stand behind it. Okay, now just, uh, back up a little bit! Little more! And now just a little... uh... twenty yards more! Perfect! Hold that pose! I think we found your new holiday card! [hushed, to Pinkie] So, how did it go? Tell me, tell me, tell me!
603007 [despondent] Well, I got the rock pouch for Maud, and... that's really the only thing that matters.
60300d Oh, I am so glad to hear that! She's going to absolutely love it!
603007 [despondent] Yup.
60300d "Yup"? That's it? You got your sister the greatest PSSSD present in the history of ever, and all you have to say is "yup"?
603007 [despondent] Yup.
60300d But... you're Pinkie Pie. You're supposed to be all [quickly] "Oh, I'm so excited I bought the rock pouch! And I know I say excited a lot when I'm actually just kind of excited, but this time I'm really excited about how excited I am about being this excited over the rock pouch!" [normally] And then you fire off your party cannon. Say, where is your cannon? [gasps] Did you lose it? Is your party cannon lost somewhere in the big city?!
603007 [despondent] Well... I wouldn't say it's lost. I mean, I know where it is. It's just... [sighs]
60300d I can clearly see that something's bothering you, and I want to help. But I can't help you unless you tell me what the problem is.
603007 [despondent] Oh, there's no problem. It just turns out that the going rate for a rock pouch in Manehattan is one party cannon. Who knew?
60300d You gave away your cannon?! But, but that party cannon is your everything! You absolutely love that cannon! How could you possibly part with something that means so much to you?!
603007 Well, I finally got Maud a gift that's just as good as the ones she always gets me, and that's all that really matters.
60300d Well, I guess I understand... maybe.
603007 Maud's going to be so excited. I can't wait to see the look on her face when she sees the pouch!
603242 [deadpan] I know, the camera loves Boulder.
60300d After the day we've had, I'm probably looking forward to the swap part of the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day even more than the two of you! [giggles] And I'm not even a Pie sister! I can't wait one more second to see the wonderful gifts you've gotten each other!
603007 Well, you're going to have to. We don't just swap, silly. We always sing the Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day Song first! Ready, Maud?
603242 [deadpan] As I'll ever be.
603007 [Pinkie Pie]
603007 It's the Pie Sisters' Swap Day Sooooooong!
603242 [deadpan] Hey.
603007 Okay, time to swap presents! Hmmmm. [licks]
603000 [beat]
60300d [growls] Just open them already!
603000 [paper ripping]
603242 [deadpan] Thanks.
603007 I knew you'd love it! It was all worth it! Look how happy she is! And I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you, Rarity. Okay! Time to open your present to me! Oh! You did it again! You got me the best present in the history of PSSSD! This is perfect! This is amazing! This is incredible! I love it, I love it, I love it! [beat] What is it?
603242 [deadpan] It's little pieces of cupcake-scented paper. You know, confetti. For your cannon.
603007 Maud... [sniffs] You know me so well. You really are the most thoughtful gift-giver in the world! I'm gonna love it five-ever! That's even longer than for-ever. [sighs happily]
60300d You're right, that is impressive. But it's no fissure in the sidewalk.
603242 [deadpan] [to Boulder] Play nice.
60300d Oh, I'm so relieved to see that you like the pouch. Especially considering what Pinkie Pie had to give up for it. [gasps] Oh!
603242 [deadpan] What?
60300d I mean... forget I said that! I'm, I-I-I'm glad to see that you like the pouch. You can remember that part. Just forget the second part. You know, the second part where I said that Pinkie Pie had to give something up— [shrieks] Perhaps I should just stop talking now. Nothing!
603007 Hee-hee, yay! I love my sister and my new confetti!
603242 [deadpan] Why isn't she using her party cannon?
60300d Gahhhh...
603000 [dirt dragging noises]
60300d [deliberately] Ooh! Wow, look how filthy my hooves are! I really should go wash them!
603242 [deadpan] Where's her cannon?
60300d No, no, stop, stop giving me that look! I can't take it! Nnnnn... [quickly] Pinkie Pie feels bad that the gifts that she always gives you are never as good as the ones that you give her!
603242 [deadpan] What?
60300d That's why she was willing to give up the party cannon for the pouch!
603242 [deadpan] She gave up her party cannon?
603007 [blows confetti]
60300d Pinkie Pie! You might want to come over here for a second!
603007 I think I know what this is about. You guys wanna ride the swans. Well, there are swan boats, but there are real swans here we can ri—
603242 [deadpan] You gave away your party cannon?
60300d [inhales] She broke me.
603007 Nnngh, it's just... It's just... It's just... You always give better gifts than me! That's why I had to get you the perfect gift! [beat] Are your hooves dirty? Where're you going?!
603242 [deadpan] To get your cannon back.
603242 [deadpan] There.
603007 Yep! That sure is the pony I got the pouch from!
60300d That's amazing! How did you know where he'd be?
603242 [deadpan] Maud Sense.
603007 Runs in the family!
603242 [deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please.
603323 Sorry, missy, all sales are final.
603242 [deadpan] [slightly more forcefully] I'd like to return this pouch for my sister's party cannon, please.
60300d Ooh, I've never seen her like this! Look at the fire in her eyes! You'd better do what she says!
603323 Fire in her eyes?
60300d Oh! Did she just clench her jaw?! I think she clenched her jaw!
603323 I didn't see.
60300d Oh, no! When she clenches her jaw... you know what that means?!
603323 What? What's it mean?
60300d Trust me, you do not want to know!
603242 [deadpan] I'd like to return this pouch.
603323 [whimpering] Here! Take it, take it, please! Just relax that jaw of yours and turn down that fire in your eyes! [whimpering]
603000 [skidding]
603007 Maud! I'm so happy you got me my party cannon back! Yay!
603000 [party cannon fires]
603007 Uh-oh. I just realized something. 'Cause you gave back the pouch for my cannon, this is now the second gift you've gotten me today! And it's something I really, really wanted! You did it again! Your gifts are always better than mine! Next year, I'm gonna have to really step it up and—
603242 [deadpan] Pinkie, gift giving isn't a competition. It's an expression of love, and you always make sure to give your gifts with lots of love. That's why I'll always love them, and you, five-ever. That's even longer than for-ever.
603007 Awwww! [to Rarity] There you are! You've sure been washing your hooves for a long time! We've got a train to catch here!
60300d I know, but there is one more sight you two simply must see before we leave.
60300d Voila! Welcome to the future home of "Rarity For You"! What do you think of the place? Is this the right location? Did I pick a good spot?
603242 [deadpan] No. You picked the perfect spot.
603007 You know, I think this might be my favorite PSSSD ever! But I can't wait 'til next year's PSSS-D-W-R!
60300d Wait. PSSS-D-W-R? What's that?
603007 P-S-S-S-D-W-R! It's a new tradition that Maud and I came up with! Pie Sisters' Surprise Swap Day...
603242 [deadpan] With Rarity.
60300d Oh! Ohhh! Why, that's the sweetest... Oh, no. Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. I know how good you two are at giving gifts! I'm going to have to get you both something amazing, and I only have a year to do it!
603007 Oh, Rarity! It doesn't matter what you get us! As long as you give your gift with love, it'll be perfect!
60300d [sighs] Why, thank you, Pinkie.
603007 Buuuut now that you mention it... I could use more confetti for my party cannon. You wouldn't believe how much of that stuff I go through in a day!
603000 [party cannon fires]
603000 [flute music over credits]
604000 [banging]
60400a Hear ye, hear ye! The first post-cutie mark meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session!
604000 [long pause]
60400a [clears throat]
604066 Oh! I'm sorry, Apple Bloom. I was distracted by the radiance of my cutie mark... Did you say something?
604065 I mean... it's pretty amazing how the colors just pop off your flank. It's kinda hard to look aw—
604000 [thump]
60400a Look, I know our cutie marks are amazing, but is that all we're gonna do now? Just spend our days starin' down at our own flanks?
604066 [sighs] I guess not.
604065 Yeah, I suppose that could get real boring...
60400a [wistfully] Yeah... [beat] This is ridiculous! We need to go out and do somethin'!
604066 Wow, you're right!
604065 Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!
60400a Exactly.
604066 Like square dancing!
604000 [square dancing music]
604065 Or mountain climbing! [stock yodel]
60400a Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed! [same yodel over square dancing music]
604080 Yeah!
60400a And the more things we try, the more chances we'll have to finally get our cutie marks! Come on!
604066 Um... Apple Bloom?
604000 [theme song]
60400a Wow... Did we really only ever do things just to get our cutie marks?
604066 I don't know. Maybe?
604065 Aw, come on! We did lots of stuff that didn't have anything to do with getting a cutie mark.
604066 Of course we did!
60400a Absolutely!
604000 [montage music]
604066 Huh. So now that we don't have to do stuff to get our cutie marks, what is it that the Cutie Mark Crusaders actually do?
60400a We do exactly what we got our cutie marks in!
604080 Helping other ponies!
604065 Ponies without cutie marks!
604066 Or ponies who've forgotten their special purpose!
60400a Exactly! We just have to find ponies who need our help! Come on!
604066 But are you sure you feel content?
604026 Eeyup.
604065 Not even a tinge of dissatisfaction?
604026 Nnnope.
60400a Not even the slightest naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?
604000 [thump]
604026 [grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.
60400a The important thing to remember is that there is no rush.
604065 The three of us tried for the longest time, but it just comes when it comes!
604066 And it's totally normal to feel confused and maybe even a little lost. But being a blank flank is nothing to be ashamed of.
604065 So if you're having even the slightest problem...
604066 ...or concerns or questions...
60400a ...we want you to know that we are here to help.
60402a I... don't think they're too worried about it yet.
60413c [babbling]
604000 [montage music]
604000 [scrolls unrolling]
604000 [door opens]
604000 [door shuts]
604000 [bits jingling]
604000 [bubblegum popping]
60400a This is gonna be a lot harder than I thought.
604066 Who knew there were so few ponies worried about their cutie marks?
604065 Kinda makes you wonder why we made such a big deal out of it for so long.
604000 [beat]
604065 What?
60400a The point is, helpin' ponies with cutie mark problems is what makes us special.
604066 But if we can't find anypony with a problem...
604065 ...Maybe we're not special.
60417b Yeah! I know exactly what you mean. You can't find a cutie mark problem. I have a cutie mark problem. It's so confusing, and I feel like the solution is staring me right in the muzzle.
604000 [beat]
60417b What?
60417b I see why you guys hang out here! It's cozy!
604065 [straining] The Crusader Clubhouse is a safe place, Mr.. um... Bulk.
604066 A place where we faced all kinds of cutie mark problems!
60400a A place where we'll go on to solve even more! Startin' with yours!
604065 No matter how long it takes!
604066 Or how hard it is!
60400a We'll solve it because that's what we do!
604080 Yeah! [straining]
60417b Yeah!
604066 So... what's your cutie mark problem?
60417b Oh, right. Uh, well, my cutie mark is a dumbbell, but I've lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville!
604065 [nervously] Have you tried lifting other things?
60417b You mean, not dumbbells?
604066 Yeah!
60400a Yeah!
60417b Yeah!
604000 [crunch]
60417b Oof! I mean... no. I hadn't thought of that. You guys are awesome!
604000 [crunch]
60417b But... what happens when I run out of other stuff?
604066 ...I guess you could teach other ponies to lift things?
60400a Yeah!
604065 Yeah!
60417b Yeah! Wow, you three really have a knack for this!
604066 That was easy!
60400a Maybe too easy.
604065 What do you mean?
60400a Well, it's lookin' like cutie mark problems are few and far between.
604066 And...?
60400a And what if we never find another one?
604065 Well...
60400a And even if we do, we could solve it so quick, it'll be like it never happened in the first place!
604066 So...?
60400a So... then the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't have any reason to exist!
604066 The problem boils down to this – we don't need to go out and do things anymore to get our cutie marks.
60400a Right! And—
604065 Ponies with cutie mark problems are hard to find.
60400a Exactly. But even when we find problems, we're so good at solvin' them that most of the time there's nothin' for the Cutie Mark Crusaders to do. So...
604000 [map unfurling]
60400a I thought we should start figurin' out ways to search all of Equestria for cutie mark problems!
604065 That kinda seems like a lot.
604066 I don't think Rarity would let me travel to the far reaches of Equestria looking for cutie mark problems.
604065 Yeah, I'm sure we'll come across them in Ponyville. And when we do, we'll totally solve them because we are so awesome at it!
604105 Hoof!
60400a But... what do we do until then?
604066 Maybe whatever we want?
60400a What do you mean?
604066 Well, we used to only do stuff to get our cutie marks or fulfill our destiny, but now we don't have to.
60400a So... we can do things just for fun? Are you girls thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?!
604105 Sure am!
60400a Apple Bloom:
60400a Makin' potions!
604065 Scootaloo:
604065 Scootering!
604066 Sweetie Belle:
604066 Singing!
604065 Just remember – stomp, kick, and roll! After this, you two are gonna love scootering as much as me!
60400a If you say so.
604065 Ready? Stomp, kick, and roll! Whooo!
604000 [tires screeching]
604065 Ta-da!
604000 [thump]
604000 [thump]
60400a [nervous laugh] I don't think I did it right.
604066 [blows pitch pipe] Do... Mi... So... It's just a simple harmony.
604065 Harmony, huh?
604066 [tapping with baton] And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three!
604066 Sweetie Belle:
604000 [on-key]
604000 Do...
60400a Apple Bloom:
604000 [off-key]
604000 So...!
604065 Scootaloo:
604000 [very off-key]
604000 Mi!
604065 Wow, that was simple!
604000 [snap]
60400a It's just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!
604000 [clink]
60400a Just a dash, and a drop, and a drip!
604000 [poof]
604000 [clink]
60400a ...and even though Scootaloo thinks bungee jumping is the bee's knees...
604000 [pen squeaking]
60400a ...Sweetie Belle would rather keep bees.
604000 [pen squeaking]
60400a [spits] Of course, I'm allergic. Who'd've thought it'd be so hard to find somethin' for us all to do together?
604065 Well, I know this might sound crazy, but what if we didn't?
60400a Didn't what?
604065 Do things together. Well, do everything together.
60400a But we're the Cutie Mark Crusaders!
604065 And we always will be! But I really wanna bungee jump! The speed, the height, the fall!
604066 And I know you two aren't interested, but I wanna try crochet.
604065 Isn't there something you've always wanted to do on your own?
60400a I don't know... I guess I figured we'd always do stuff together. But bungee jumping sounds just as scary as crochet sounds borin'.
604065 That's okay. Sweetie Belle and I can do the things we like, and you can do whatever you like!
604066 Just as soon as you figure out what it is.
60400a I guess...
604065 Great! Then we can meet back here and talk all about what we've done!
60400a But I don't know what it'll be.
604066 You'll find something!
604065 Something awesome!
60400a [sighs] Well... I guess now I have to.
60400a [Apple Bloom]
60400a I never imagined myself out on my own
60400a Tryin' to find out what's next for me
60400a The Cutie Mark Crusaders have always been my home
60400a Maybe now there's more that I could be
60400a I guess as time goes by
60400a Everypony has to go out on their own
60400a And maybe someday I'll have to try
60400a Somethin' new that's just for me
60400a A little somethin' that could be
60400a Just my own and I won't feel so left behind
60400a We used to say that we'd be always side by side
60400a Maybe things are changin' and this could mean goodbye
60400a I always thought our friendship was all I'd ever need
60400a We've always been crusadin' – what else is there for me?
60400a I guess as time goes by
60400a Everypony has to go out on their own
60400a And maybe someday I'll have to try
60400a Somethin' new that's just for me
60400a A little somethin' that could be
60400a Just my own and I won't feel so left behind
604324 [muffled] And one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four—
604000 [door opens]
60400a Whatever kind of dancin' y'all are doin', you're doin' it together, and I want in! [beat] I-I mean, uh, [clears throat] Would it be okay if I enrolled in this dance class?
604324 Well, let's see what you can do. We have a recital at town hall tonight, and a spot just opened up! [hushed] Tender Taps is a little too shy to perform. But if you're ready to step into a partnered routine...
60400a That sounds an awful lot like friendship! And I'm ready for anything I don't have to do by myself!
604324 Well then! Dancing with partner will be perfect. [claps]
604000 [slow tango music]
60400a Whooooooa!
604000 [faster tango music]
60400a Whoa, whoaaa!
604000 [sound of skittles being knocked over]
604000 [thump]
60400a Whew! I feel like that went pretty good, but let's give it one more whirl, because it's important that I do a good job partnering with my new group of friends.
604324 Eh... Now I'm think of it, you might be better as soloist.
604324 Uh, partnering is a little advanced for you. But there's still lots you can do on your own.
60400a I'm sorry, but doin' stuff on my own is exactly what I don't want.
604000 [door opens]
604325 Sorry it didn't work out.
60400a Tryin' different things with my friends is always fun, even when we were terrible. Now it's just terrible.
604325 You weren't that bad. You just need to learn a few things on your own. Being a soloist can be fun! [tap dancing] Ha. Haha! You just have to do it with feeling!
604000 [beat]
60400a [sighs] Thanks, but... without my friends, I don't think I'll ever feel again. Good luck at the recital.
604325 Oh, I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I want to. It's kind of all I think about. I bet some day my cutie mark will even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying!
60400a [deadpan] Yeah, okay. Nice meetin' you.
604325 You, too. [tap dancing]
604065 Sweetie Belle! You are not gonna believe this, but I think I like bungee jumping even more than scootering!
604066 Seriously?! That's amazing! Look what I did!
604065 Wow, uh, that's, um...
604066 Horrible! But it was so much fun! Rarity showed me how, even though she says [imitating Rarity] "Crochet is knitting's poorer cousin", [normal] but I loved it!
604065 Awesome!
604000 [door creaks open]
60400a Oh, hello, girls. Have fun pursuing your own interests?
604065 Apple Bloom? What are you doing sitting in the dark?
604066 Yeah, we thought you'd be out looking for things you like to do.
60400a [laughs] I did. I looked all over town. I looked... and I looked... and I looked... and you know what I found? Nothin'!
604000 [blind snaps up]
604065 You tried every one of these?
60400a And each one just made me feel more alone than the next! I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!
604065 Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do everything together.
604066 Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.
60400a Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things.
604065 I can't believe you thought we didn't want to hang out anymore.
604066 I can't believe you tried all this stuff and didn't find one thing you liked!
60400a Well, I kind of liked dancin', mainly because it looked like somethin' you couldn't do alone, but... I wasn't very good at it.
604066 Well, you don't have to be good at something to have fun!
604065 And being good doesn't always mean you will.
60400a I know... I met the best dancer in the world, but he was so shy, he couldn't bring himself to perform, even though he really, really wanted to.
604066 I don't suppose this dancing pony had a cutie mark, did he?
604000 [door opens]
60400a You're here!
604023 Shhhh!
604000 [audience cheering]
604000 [door opens]
604325 What are you doing here?
60400a You told me that you wanted to perform more than anythin', but I was too caught up in myself to listen. You're the best dancer I've ever seen, and I'm here to convince you to get out on that stage!
604000 [piano playing]
604325 Um, didn't I also tell you that dancing in front of other ponies is t-t-terrifying?! I don't know if you noticed, but that auditorium is full of other ponies! I can't go out there! What if I'm bad?!
60400a We can go on together! No matter what, you'll look good dancin' next to me.
604000 [audience cheering]
604325 [sighs] All right, I'll do it. But I don't have my costume, and the backdrop is all wrong, and we don't have time to change it!
60400a Leave everything to us.
604325 [nervously] I don't know about this...
604066 Don't worry, you'll be just fine!
604000 [piano stops playing]
60400a Here goes nothin'...
604000 [clunking]
604000 [audience member coughs]
604325 [gulps]
604000 [jazz-type music starts]
60400a [clunky tap dancing]
604000 [thump]
604000 [audience laughing]
60400a Can't be any worse than I was!
604325 [tentatively, then progressively more confident tap dancing] [heavy breathing]
604000 [pause, then audience cheering]
604000 [cutie mark zap]
604325 I can't believe it! It's just what I always imagined it would be! And if it weren't for all of you, I wouldn't even have it.
604065 No problem!
604066 It's what we do.
60400a I only wish I'd realized what you needed right away instead of mopin' around for no reason...
604325 Well, either way, I hope you keep dancing. [short tap-dancing burst]
60400a [taps] You know, I just might! It sure is a lot of fun, and I'm pretty confident I can only get better. [to the Crusaders] I'm sorry I was so silly about us all doin' our own things. If we hadn't, I might never even have tried dancin'!
604325 Or find out I needed help!
604066 With each of us going out and trying things on our own, we'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help!
604065 And trying new stuff might even make us better at helping them, like how I used my bungee jumping to change the sets!
604066 Or my crochet to make the costumes!
60400a Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!
604080 Yeah!
604000 [jazz-type music over credits]
605000 [magic aura noises]
605000 [gems clacking]
605005 [licks lips]
60500d [hushed] The last time I was here, I woke them and ended up with a mane full of bats! [sighs] Thanks for being my basket holder, Spike.
605005 Basket holder? I thought I was your bodyguard.
60500d [hushed] What? Oh, heh, yes, yes, that of course, too. Oh, for once I wish unicorn magic wasn't so... luminescent!
605000 [gems clacking]
60500d [hushed] Spike! You'll wake the bats! Turn that off!
605005 Ugh, I can't! [groans]
60500d [gasps]
605000 [bats squeaking]
605000 [theme song]
605003 I'm so glad you two could come!
60501a Of course. We so rarely get a chance to relax and just visit.
605019 There's usually some crisis we have to deal with. Somepony always needs our help. But today—
60500d [muffled, wailing] Help!
605000 [door opens]
60500d Twilight! There's something wrong with Spike!
605003 What's wrong?
605005 [grunts] I don't know! Nngh! All of a sudden, my scales just started glowing and... burning!
60501a Little is known about dragon culture, but this is a phenomenon we've seen before. It is the call of the Dragon Lord.
605019 Dragons glow whenever the Dragon Lord has need of them in the Dragon Lands.
605005 Great... H-How do I make it stop?!
60501a The only way to end the summons is to answer it. You must journey to the Dragon Lands and see what is expected of you.
60500d B-B-But the Dragon Lands are full of... dragons! And they're ghastly creatures! [beat] Oh, oh, not you, of course, Spikey-wikey. But remember that rotten Garble?
605005 [gulps] How could I forget? He would have burnt us to a crisp if you weren't there. If I have to go to the Dragon Lands, would you two come with me?
605003 Ooh! Oh my goodness, I'd love to! We are sadly lacking any information on dragon culture and customs. I could research them – maybe even write an article! This could be my chance to make a great contribution to the knowledge of Equestria! [beat] And be there for Spike, heh, of course.
605019 Be very careful. The Dragon Lands are particularly dangerous for ponies. It would be wise to be discreet.
60500d Ooh! I'm sure I still have the dragon costume we used the last time we snuck into the Dragon Lands! [giggles]
605003 I think we might want something a little more practical this time.
60500d Hmmm... Well, it may be practical, but this disguise isn't flattering in the slightest!
605003 [hushed] It's not supposed to be flattering. It's supposed to blend in!
605005 Shh!
605170 Hey-hey, look! It's our old friend Sparkle-warkle.
605005 It's Spike.
605170 Are you sure your pony friends didn't give you a pony name?
605005 It's nice to see you too, Garble.
605170 I didn't say it was nice to see you. It's not. I don't like you. Was I not clear about that?
6050dc [grunt]
605005 Hey! That's my rock!
605170 Oh, really? Then why aren't you sitting on it?
605000 [teenage dragons laughing]
605326 Dragons of Equestria, hear me! I have been Dragon Lord for longer than many of you can remember, and my reign has been extraordinary! [beat] Agree with me!
605327 [general agreeing noises] Torch! Torch! Torch! Torch!
605005 Who is that?
605170 It's Dragon Lord Torch, dummy.
605005 No, next to him.
605170 That's his daughter, Princess Ember. I wouldn't even look at her if I were you, unless you want Torch to eat you!
605005 [gulps]
605003 [hushed] This is fascinating! Dragons are notoriously reckless, but they do whatever the Dragon Lord says!
605326 Unfortunately, according to dragon law, it is time for me to step down. Sad, I know. [beat] Be sad!
605000 [dragons crying]
605326 This is why I have summoned you – to compete for the throne in the Gauntlet of Fire!
605000 [dragons cheering]
605326 Whomever has the strength and fortitude to retrieve this bloodstone scepter from the heart of the flame-cano will be crowned Lord of the Dragons!
605000 [explosion]
605000 [magic shimmering]
605003 [hushed] When the scepter disappeared, the dragons stopped glowing! We are learning so much!
60500d [prepares to sneeze] [sneezes]
605005 Uh, excuse me!
605170 Ugh, you even sneeze like a pony!
605326 The Gauntlet is dangerous, for I designed it myself! Only dragons with my ferocity, strength, and determination will be able to finish. We will gather at the cliff when the sun is at its peak!
605000 [dragons cheering]
605005 I don't want to be Dragon Lord or dragon toast, and I stopped glowing, so let's sneak out of here!
605326 Ah! Where do you think you're going, little dragon?!
605005 Oh, uh, hi, your Lordship. Uh, I was just going home!
605326 You don't get to leave unless I say you can!
605328 Dad, look at him. He's just a runt. Besides, he doesn't even wanna compete. Let him go.
605326 He is rather tiny, heh-heh. I could squish him with my pinky claw. [chuckles]
605005 [nervous chuckle]
605326 That wasn't a joke. It was a fact. When I want you to laugh, I will say "be amused!"
605005 Of course, your Lordship! I, uh, guess I don't understand dragon customs. Another reason why I shouldn't compete.
605326 [sighs] Hm. Very well then, little dragon. I release you.
605005 Thank you! [to Ember] And thank you.
605326 [grunts] Where do you think you're going?
605328 To prepare for the Gauntlet.
605326 No, you're not. You're not much bigger than that runt I just sent home!
605328 But I'm smarter than most of these boulderheads and you know it!
605326 Being smart won't help you win this Gauntlet! It was designed for a big, strong dragon to win, because it takes a big, strong dragon to lead! Besides, I said no!
605328 [growls] I hate when he does that!
605000 [dragons chatting]
605329 Ha. When I become Dragon Lord, I will make burps an official greeting!
60532a Ha, you? Please! When I win, I will pillage Equestria for all their pillows. Why should these ponies be comfortable while we sleep on rocks?
605170 That's nothing! When I'm in charge, the first thing I'll do is get revenge on those puny ponies! They'll regret they ever crossed Garble! We'll take whatever we want from Equestria and burn the rest!
605003 [hushed] Oh, my gosh!
60500d [hushed] Ooh, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope that burping dragon wins!
605005 None of them can win! Equestria's in big trouble if any of them are in charge!
605003 But what can we do?
605005 There's only one thing to do, and only I can do it! I have to win the Gauntlet of Fire!
6050dc Oh...
60500d What do you mean you have to win the Gauntlet?
605005 It's the only way to protect Equestria from the dragons. You heard them! They have horrible plans for ponies if they win! So somehow, I have to do it!
605003 There has to be another way. It's too dangerous. Besides, if you win, you'd have to stay here!
605005 I know, but there's no other way to keep my friends safe.
605003 Well, if you're staying to compete, then we're staying to cheer you on!
605326 I thought I released you, tiny one!
605005 I decided to compete. I am a dragon, after all.
605170 Are you sure? You can't even fly!
605000 [dragons laughing]
605326 All dragons are welcome to compete, but they do so at their own peril! Flying to Flame-cano Island is the first of many challenges you will face in your quest to find the bloodstone scepter! [roars]
605000 [dragon commotion]
605170 Good luck! Just kidding. I hope you lose.
605000 [smack]
605005 [scream]
605000 [splash]
605005 [gasps] [sarcastically] Thanks, Garble! I was planning on swimming anyway!
60500d You can do it, Spike!
605000 [sea worms roaring]
605000 [splash]
605005 He's gonna drown!
605003 Spike!
605000 [bubbling]
605005 [gasps] [panting]
605005 Hey, are you okay?
605328 [coughing]
605005 [gasps] Princess Ember!
605328 What do you think you're doing?
60500d Only saving your ungrateful scales!
605328 Did that seaweed just talk? Ponies?! What are they doing here?!
605005 They're my friends!
605328 Friends? Dragons don't do friends.
605005 Well, this dragon does.
605328 Whatever. I don't care as long as none of you get in my way. I have a Gauntlet to win.
605005 But I thought your dad said that—
605328 I don't care what my dad said! I'll show him and every dragon who thinks I'm just a little princess there are better things than being big and strong!
605000 [slingtail grunts]
605000 [thwack]
605170 [scream] [grunts] Don't leave me here, Spike!
605005 [straining]
605170 Ha-ha! Knew you'd do it. Your pony friends made you soft.
605005 Uh-huh. You're welcome.
605170 For what? I didn't say thank you. [sniffs] Wow, you even smell like ponies. [sniffs] Or is it coming from over there? [sniffing]
605328 [gruff voice] Uh, that's just me. I, uh, robbed some ponies on my way over here.
605170 Huh, I like your style. Have I met you before? You kind of look like—
605005 My, uh, old neighbor! Uh, Sandy... Rockbeach!
605170 Stupid slingtails knocked me down! But I've wasted enough time making small talk. Get it? Ha-ha! Because you're too small to win this! I'm funny.
605328 Why did you cover for me? You could've had one less competitor.
605005 I could ask you the same thing. You could've told Garble about my friends.
605000 [Wilhelm scream]
605000 [thumps]
605328 Yikes... That looks rough. But that's what makes it a challenge.
605005 Are you kidding? Those boulders are huge! Hey, what if we worked together? You fly me up there, and I'll help look out for boulders, like a second set of eyes!
60500d Pssst!
605000 [flump]
60500d [hushed] Spike! Are you sure it's a good idea to team up with Ember? You don't know her too well.
605005 I do know she could've told Garble about you, but she didn't. I think we can trust her.
605003 Her behavior does seem contradictory to everything I've noted about dragons so far.
605328 Hey, you, little fella! I've thought about it, and your plan makes sense. Let's do it.
605005 Really? Great! It's a deal!
605328 Just so you know, this doesn't mean we're gonna pick flowers or exchange necklaces or whatever pony friends do.
605003 Good luck. We'll meet you at the top.
605000 [dragon commotion]
605005 Pull up! There's one on your tail!
605328 [yelps]
605005 Go left!
605005 So what do we do now?
605328 I think we go through there.
605000 [roar of flame]
605000 [dragons whimpering]
60500d [yelps] Oh, that looks scary! I mean, you can do it!
605328 Listen, Spike. I wouldn't have made it this far without you. So I guess, if you want to, we could keep working together. I mean, just until we get through that tunnel.
605005 Okay!
605003 [hushed] We'll be right behind you!
605000 [crunching]
605170 [straining]
605000 [crunch]
605170 [groaning]
605000 [various "shing"s]
605005 [gasps] Oof!
605000 [thud]
605170 Urgh!
605000 [shing!]
605170 [groaning]
60500d Oh, you made it! Oh, we were so worried!
605005 About us? [scoffs] That tunnel was cake! [groans]
605000 [thump]
605328 Wait. How did you two get through?
605000 [rumbling]
60500d [yelps]
605005 Rarity!
60500d [yelps] [panting] Oh, thanks, Spike!
605005 [sighs] It was nothing.
605328 Nothing? You just risked everything to save her! And they're putting themselves in danger just to support you!
605005 Well, that's just what friends do. Don't you have anyone who looks out for you?
605328 Not really. Unless I count you. [beat] Which I don't! Because we were only helping each other get through the tunnel, and now we're through the tunnel, so that's it.
605005 Wait, what do you mean?
605328 Well, there's only one winner, one scepter, and one Dragon Lord. So I guess it's every dragon for themselves.
605005 Oh. So we aren't really friends?
605328 Maybe if we were in Ponyland, but like I said, dragons don't do friendship.
605005 I can't believe Ember ditched me.
60500d [muffled] Oh, you're better off. She was only looking out for herself. She's just like all the other dragons.
605005 She's not, though. I know it. She saved me, even when she didn't have to. I don't care what she says. That makes us friends.
605003 Is it just me, or have we seen this crevasse three times already?
605005 It's kinda hard to tell. They all look the same. Except for this one! Look! We made it! I can't believe I'm the only dragon to make it this far!
605170 You're not! And I'm not losing to a puny pony-loving dragon like you!
60500d [yelps] [muffled] We have to do something!
605003 [muffled] Look!
605000 [thump]
605170 [yelps]
605005 [screaming] Ember! I thought it was every dragon for themselves! Why did you save me?!
605328 That's what friends do! And I am. I mean, we are. I never should have left you back there. Agh, please don't make me talk about my feelings!
605170 What the?! [growls]
605328 Spike! Get the scepter! [grunts]
605000 [thump]
605170 [straining] Argh! Whoa!
605328 [straining]
605000 [thump]
605000 [ding!]
605170 [frustrated grunt] I'm sick and tired of you two helping each other! Dragons don't do helping!
605328 These dragons do! [grunts]
605000 [thump]
605000 [dragons chattering]
605005 [panting] Whoa...
605000 [ding!]
605000 [magic roaring]
605000 [explosion]
605005 Leave her alone!
605170 What? You?! You have the scepter?! But that means that you're...
605328 The Dragon Lord. Dragon Lord Spike.
605170 [groans] [reluctantly] Dragon... Lord... Spike...
605005 That's right! Uh... Now, go start your long journey home. And give every dragon you see on the way a hug. Don't tell them why.
605170 Awww! But that'll be super embarrassing!
605005 I command you to do it!
605170 [annoyed noise] I can't believe this...
605328 Dragon Lord Spike. Hm, has a nice ring to it.
605005 Dragon Lord Ember sounds a lot better.
605328 What? No. You're the Dragon Lord now.
605005 The Dragon Lord is whoever brings the scepter back to your father! Besides, you'll make a great leader. I was just doing this to protect the ponies. But I know you'll protect them just as well as I would have.
605328 You sure about this?
605005 Absolutely. My home is in Equestria with my friends.
605328 Well, you'll have at least one friend here too. What are you doing?
605005 It's called a hug!
605328 Oh. I don't know if I like it. But... okay.
605005 Mmmmm!
605003 [hushed] Awww!
60500d [giggles]
605000 [magic shimmering]
605326 Ember? You?!
605328 I know you didn't think I could do it, but I did.
605326 I expressly told you not to do it, because you're not—!
605328 I'm not big and strong. I know. But you know what? I won anyway. So maybe it takes more than just being big and strong to be a good Dragon Lord!
605326 I was wrong, Ember. You might not be big, but you are strong and smart, and perhaps that counts for more than I thought. And you will make an excellent leader.
605328 Thanks, dad. [to dragons] Agree with him! Just kidding! That's not gonna be my thing.
605326 [laughing] Dragons, hear me! I present to you our new Dragon Lord, Ember!
605000 [dragons cheering]
605326 [to Garble] Hm? What is the meaning of this?!
605170 I can't tell you!
605328 [laughs]
605003 You did well, Spike. With Ember as Dragon Lord, the ponies will be safe and you've gained us a powerful ally.
605005 And a new friend!
605003 Plus, Ember said I could write to her anytime I had questions about dragon culture! With this much information, I'll be able to write a whole book on dragons!
60500d And I gained tons of ideas for a new line of camouflage clothing! I think I'll call it "Camo-Maud"!
60516d [laughing]
605000 [credits]
606000 [wheels squeaking]
606000 [light thud]
606003 First lesson of the day, we very carefully set the table without using magic, so that— Yikes!
606000 [silverware clattering]
606003 Did you...?! How? When? What?!
60627c What?
606003 I said no magic. You were supposed to do it by hoof so I could work in a friendship lesson.
60627c Oh, I heard "set the table" and just kinda went for it.
606003 Well, if you hadn't used magic, you'd have heard me say, uh... this plate represents your head, this spoon is your heart, and the knives... are sharp! Always be careful with knives. [sigh] The metaphors make more sense when you're actually setting the table.
60627c Should I... change it back?
606003 I just want to make sure you're ready for this dinner. Princess Celestia will be joining us tomorrow night to see how the friendship lessons are going!
60627c If it's just you, me, and Princess Celestia, why are there four seats?
606003 Well, the whole point is for you to bring a new friend. That way, the princess will see for herself just how far you've come. And how good a teacher you have.
60627c Well, I can't choose. I like all your friends.
606003 That's the best part! You have to make a new friend!
60627c New friends? Hey, maybe I'll just force friendships by magically enslaving the entire population of Ponyville!
606003 Starlight!
60627c Kidding! [laughs nervously]
606000 [theme song]
60627c Let's see. Make new friends in Ponyville, the friendliest place in Equestria. Shouldn't be hard...
606007 Need to make a new friend, huh? I know just the pony for you!
606007 Miss Starlight Glimmer, meet Mrs Cake!
606000 [small splats]
60602a How are you, dearie?
60627c Are you baking? Can I help?
606000 [magic whirls]
606007 Wow, Mrs Cake! Look what your new friend made you!
60602a [chuckles] New friend. I like the sound of– [gasps] Howza-wowza! A-Are you trying to put me out of business with your fancy magical-thingy-whatsit cake?!
606000 [splat]
60602a [yelps and spits]
60627c Sorry...
606007 [licks, swallows] In her defense, it is delicious! [chomps]
606000 [thump]
606000 [apples falling]
606008 I think I have just the pony for you, Starlight. Meet Big Mac!
606026 Eeyup!
606008 He's not much of a talker.
606026 Nnope.
60627c Oh, that's too bad. I love a good conversation.
606000 [magic wisps]
606026 [motormouth] Eeyup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-yup-y-y-y-y-you did something! Whoa! What's happening? I feel really weird! I'm talkin' so much! And I'm so articulate! Enunciating with such precise pronunciation! Annie Apple awoke and accidentally ate an auburn azalea! [screams] Make it stop!
606008 [growls]
60627c I can't be friends with somepony who doesn't talk.
606008 [growls]
60627c ...And I guess my first instinct shouldn't be to magically command ponies to act the way I want them to?
606008 [growls]
60627c Alright, I'll change him back!
60600d The trick to finding a new friend is to render yourself radiant. First impressions count a great deal, you know.
60627c I'm glad you all got past my first impression.
60600d Well, everypony deserves a second chance. Ooh! Now, I have a top-notch idea. I'm thinking pastel silk here and here with a crinoline underneath.
60627c You really think a new outfit will help me meet ponies?
60600d Oh, with the right outfit, you can do anything, darling!
60627c When will it be ready?
60600d Three weeks.
60627c Dinner's tomorrow.
60600d Well then, how about a hat from the... [clears throat] ...clearance bin?
606000 [fabric ripping]
60627c Ugh! Maybe not.
60600c Heh. Nopony's gonna make friends with you because of your outfit. The only thing you want a new friend draped in is coolness.
60627c Like you?
60600c Yeah, but you already know me, so... [gasps] [spitting] Spitfire! Heh. Sorry.
60627c Who's that?
60600c [gasps] Only the Wonderbolt-iest pony in the Wonderbolts! Come on, I'll introduce you!
606000 [sonic boom]
60600c You coming or what?
60627c I guess my first question would be, "What's a Wonderbolt?"
60600c [gasps] You've never heard of the Wonderbolts?! Where have you been?!
60627c [nervously] Enslaving villages, I guess...
60600c Right.
606040 [giggling]
60627c You're adorable, but probably not what Twilight had in mind.
60600e [sighs]
606000 [ponies chattering]
60627c [groan] What is going on? This is Ponyville! If I can't make a friend here, there's gotta be something wrong with me! [sighs] Okay, calm down. Nobody makes friends with a total stresscase.
606000 [more ponies chattering]
60627c [to herself] Stop stressing... Stop stressing!
606000 [long beat]
606000 [door opens and shuts]
60627c [sighs] This is just what I needed.
606037 [sighs] Tell me about it.
60627c You ever have one of those days?
606037 For me, they're all one of those days.
60627c [giggles]
606037 I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville.
60627c I'm not from here either. I've been trying to make friends, but it's not easy. They're not saying it, but I think everypony knows about my past. I may have been a tiny bit... completely and utterly evil?
606037 Ponies judge me on my past too.
60627c Finally, a pony I can relate to.
606003 Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta spoon, strawberry pick. I'm beginning to think that after friendship, the greatest magic of all is proper silverware placement! [giggles]
60627c Twilight, guess what? I made a new friend!
606003 That's fantastic news!
60627c She's great!
606003 Great!
60627c She's powerful!
606003 Powerful?
60627c She's—
606037 Hello... princess!
606003 Trixie?!
60627c You know each other?
606003 You could say that.
606037 We've had our differences. What matters is Twilight gave me a second chance, and I appreciate it.
606000 [pause]
606003 So, um, what brings you to Ponyville?
606037 The Grrrreat and Powerful Trrrrixie has come to perform a new stage show of grand illusion! I am calling it "The Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour"!
60627c [hushed] That's kind of a mouthful.
606037 [hushed] It's a working title.
606003 Starlight? A moment? Over here? [hushed] I know I said make friends with anypony, but, well, with Trixie's past, and your past, I'm not sure she's the best... first friend.
60627c But whatever she did, you've forgiven her, right?
606003 Of course. It's just... She wasn't the nicest pony.
60627c Well, you did say anypony, and I just assumed that you'd trust me to make my own friends the way Princess Celestia trusted you.
606003 [sighs] You're right. I trust you. Just be back in time for the dinner.
60627c Thanks, Twilight! You won't regret it!
606003 I hope not. [sighs]
606037 This magic show's gonna be the greatest thing Ponyville's ever seen!
60632b [unintelligible whispering] ...did you see...?
60632c [unintelligible whispering] ...did you hear...?
606037 Everypony always says they'll give you a second chance, but deep down, they never forget.
60627c That's what I'm worried about.
606037 [sighs]
60627c What is it?
606037 I heard what Twilight said about me, and she's right. I wasn't very nice. So I'd understand if you didn't want to be friends.
60627c Are you kidding? You're the first pony I've met who has any idea how I feel!
606037 Can you keep a secret?
60627c What are friends for?
606037 [hushed] The things I've done? I did them because I was jealous of Twilight. She's just the best at everything, and I wanted to beat her at something!
60627c [hushed] Your secret's safe with me.
606037 Thanks. Want to help me unpack my wagon?
606037 I spend a lot of time on the road with my wagon, so it might be a tad messy.
60627c Maybe I can help. I'm pretty good at organizing stuff. Magic props, brainwashed crowds...
60632e [laughing]
606003 Pssssssst! Pssst! Psssssst! Shhhhhh!
60627c Uh, I'll catch up. I think there's something in my hoof.
606037 Sure. The wagon's right around the corner.
606003 [hushed] So, how's it going with your new friend?
60627c [sarcastically] Great. Thanks for asking in a completely not creepy way.
606003 Because you know, if it isn't working out for any reason, I could introduce you to my friend here.
606000 [bush rustling]
60627c [deadpan] Nice to meet you.
606003 No, no! You can come out now!
606000 [dubstep playing]
606003 You like music, right? DJ Pon-3'd be the perfect friend for tonight's incredibly important dinner with Celestia. You know, if you decide to make a last-minute change. Heh.
60627c So back at your castle when you said "I trust you", you meant "I don't trust you".
606003 [nervously] Who can really say who said what? I know I can't! [to DJ Pon-3] Can you?
606000 [dubstep fades out]
606003 Starlight, I'm just trying to look out for you.
60627c [sighs] I appreciate it, but you're wrong about Trixie. She's just like me. We have a real connection.
606003 That's kind of what I'm afraid of. Oh! What about her?
606000 [thump]
60627c Please, Twilight! I know you're trying to help, but I need to make friends on my own if I'm going to become a better pony.
606003 But do you really think Trixie's the one to help you with that?
60627c Wow. Trixie was right. You're not really giving her a second chance. I wonder what that says about how you feel about me.
60615c [snorts]
606000 [bird flapping]
606003 Oh! Now he'd be perfect!
60627c [groans]
606000 [thump]
606000 [dragging]
60627c I was thinking. You said Twilight is better than you at everything, but that's not true. You're better at magic.
606037 Only when I'm wearing a soul-sucking evil amulet, so I don't think that counts. Funny story. Don't need to get into it.
60627c I meant stage magic.
606037 Well, of course! Great? Yes. Powerful? Obviously. But I'm not the best. As great and powerful as I am, there's one trick I've never been able to do – the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive!
606000 [silent film-type piano music and film reel flickering]
606037 [narrating] Only one magician has ever pulled it off – my hero, Hoofdini! You are supposed to blast yourself into the open mouth of a hungry manticore! After the manticore chews you up and swallows you, you magically step out of a box on the other side of the stage!
606000 [film reel runs out]
606037 Completely unharmed!
60627c That sounds very...
606037 Dangerous?
60627c I was gonna say cool!
606037 I knew I liked you for a reason. I don't know how he did it! If I tried it, I'd get chewed up and swallowed by that manticore.
60627c Not if you could use real magic.
606037 Obviously. Way to rub it in.
60627c No, I mean, I could help! You could start the trick, and right before you got chewed up, I could use magic to save you...
606000 [magic zap]
60627c ...and make you appear in the black box!
606037 I guess that would work... But if you made one mistake, I'd be a goner.
60627c Hah. When it comes to magic, I don't make mistakes. Maybe I could be your... magic show helper pony!
606037 We call it "assistant" in the magician biz. And... nopony's ever offered to help before.
60627c Well, I'd be honored.
606037 You may have just made my great and powerful magic show even better! Which I didn't think was possible! We're gonna blow them away tonight!
60627c [groans] I can't! Tonight's this incredibly important dinner with Twilight.
606037 Oh.
60627c Can I vent for a minute?
606037 What are friends for?
60627c Even after Twilight says she trusts me, she clearly doesn't trust me enough to choose my own friends. [sighs] I guess you were right. No second chances.
606037 Hmph, I wish I could say I was surprised. Well, lucky for Princess Twilight, I have my magic show tonight. If you have to go to the dinner, I completely understand. [dramatically] I just hope I find a way to survive the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive without my new assistant!
606000 [ice sculpture dripping]
606003 Starlight Glimmer should be here, heh, any minute, heh. Any minute now... [nervous laugh] [forced] How about I introduce everyone? Our friendship lessons are going so well! She made three new friends! She has such great taste in friends. I don't know where she would've learned that! [nervous laugh]
60615c Starlight Glimmer? I thought you said "nosehair trimmers"! What's going on? I'm hungry! And my nose is too hairy. [snorts]
606003 [nervously] Ha-ha, Cranky Doodle! You're so funny! If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna check the kitchen. Maybe she got lost amongst the, uh... artichokes! [nervous laugh]
606003 Starlight? Has anyone seen Starlight Glimmer? I'm looking for her! Trixie.
606007 So this is the Humble and Penitent Trixie's Equestrian Apology Tour?
606008 Ain't that a mouthful of molasses.
606037 It's a working title! Oh, this is gonna be the greatest night of my life! Excuse me. Our lives.
60627c [sighs] I'm so glad we're not at that boring dinner.
606003 Ahem? You just decided to skip our dinner without telling me? Are you aware that, at this very moment, Princess Celestia is waiting for you at a table with exquisite silverware placement?!
60627c Yes, but—
606003 This is exactly why I didn't want you to make friends with Trixie.
606037 A-ha! You still don't trust me! But guess what, princess? It doesn't matter if you want to give me a second chance or not. Starlight had to choose between you and me, and she chose me! Your pupil chose me, so ha! I win!
60627c You win? That sounds like you just made friends with me to beat Twilight.
606037 Exactly! [beat] Wait! I mean, no! I got caught up in the moment. I like you. Beating Twilight is just a bonus. [gasps] Saying that didn't help, did it?
60627c I should've known. Nopony else in Ponyville wanted to be my friend. Why would you? [controlled sobbing]
606037 Wait, it's not like that! I am your friend. [groans]
606003 Well, you won. I hope you're happy!
606037 [sighs] Looks like the Great and Powerful Trixie is back to a solo show.
606003 Trixie?
606037 ...Which is exactly the way she likes it! Thank you, Princess Twilight, for getting rid of that annoying pony who wanted to be my first friend! I am not sad at all! I definitely don't feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces!
606000 [spotlight clanks]
606037 [unenthusiastic] Come one, come all. Come and see the Pathetic and Friendless Trixie's "Way-To-Go-Dum-Dum-You-Really-Messed-It-Up-This-Time Repentance Tour".
606000 [crowd confused]
606037 It's a working title! [unenthusiastic] Behold, your fears come true. A pony-eating manticore.
606000 [manticore roars]
60600e [trembling]
606037 [unenthusiastic] For tonight, the Great and Powerful Trixie will be performing the Moonshot Manticore Mouth Dive.
606000 [crowd gasps]
606037 [unenthusiastic] Now, now, save your gasps for when I defy the beast's jaws of doom and appear inside that black box. [dramatically] I was supposed to perform this trick with my great and powerful assistant, who was also my great and powerful friend!
606003 Starlight, when I first came to Ponyville, Princess Celestia gave me room to make my own decisions and my own friends. I need to give you the same freedom. I shouldn't have tried to pick and choose your friends for you. Just like me, you have to make your own decisions and your own friends.
60627c But... what if Trixie really was using me just to one-up you?
606003 From what I've seen, she's the real thing.
606000 [fuse lights]
606003 But it's not my place to judge. It's all up to you.
606000 [manticore roars]
606000 [fuse hisses]
606037 Starlight? If you're out there and you still want to be friends, let's be great and powerful together! [slightly echoing] Please?
606000 [cannon fires]
606000 [manticore roars]
606037 [shrieks]
606000 [manticore swallows and belches]
606000 [crowd gasps]
60600e [faints]
606000 [crowd confused]
606000 [magic zap]
606000 [crunch]
606037 [woozy] Behold, the Peat and Growerful Triskie...!
606000 [thud]
606000 [beat]
606000 [crowd cheers]
606037 [amplified] And now, I'm proud to introduce my great and powerful assistant! [normal] And best friend. [amplified] Starlight Glimmer!
606000 [crowd cheers]
606003 Trixie!
606037 What do you want?
606003 I was wrong. I'm sorry. And I have to hand it to you. I could never have pulled off a trick like that.
606037 Thank you, princess.
606000 [fireworks launch]
606000 [ice sculpture dripping]
60615c How do you get your hair to do that all the time?
606019 [sighs]
606000 [silent film-type piano music over credits]
607065 Hey! Rainbow Dash!
60700c Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?
607065 The Rainbow Dash Fan Club just decided – everypony's coming to see you when the Wonderbolts' new tour comes through Ponyville!
60700c Well, it's great that you guys are going to the show, Scoot, but I won't actually be performing in it. Reservists aren't in the show unless one of the real Wonderbolts can't fly. [chuckles] I'll probably be working crowd control or something.
607065 You're still gonna be wearing a Wonderbolts uniform though, right?
60700c A Reservist one, yeah.
607065 Hmm. That's good enough for me.
607000 [engines roaring]
607000 [boom]
60700c [gasps]
607065 Whoa!
60707c Rainbow Dash! Glad we found you. We need you in the show when we get to Ponyville. Flying.
607065 But she's only in the Reserves!
60707c Not anymore, kid.
60700c [slow gasp] You mean...
607065 [gasps] Rainbow Dash! You're finally a full-fledged Wonderbolt! Woo-hoo! [laughs] Yeah, Rainbow Dash! Whoo!
60707c Heh. What she said.
607000 [theme song]
607000 [zooming]
60700c Uh, anypony seen my wing balm? I don't want to be stiff when I show up at Wonderbolt headquarters.
607005 Got it!
607000 [thump]
607000 [click]
607003 Do you have time to tell us what happened, Rainbow Dash?
60700d Oh, yes, we must know every detail!
607000 [thump]
607007 Start from when you were a foal and you first knew your destiny was to become a Wonderbolt!
60700c Heh. Well, not much to tell, really. Spitfire told me the Wonderbolts need me to go on tour with them.
60700e That's really great. I know how long you've been waiting for a spot to open up.
60700c Yeah. Fire Streak decided to retire and teach full-time. Cloudsdale Flight School will probably be churning out Wonderbolts with him there. But guess who was at the top of the Reserve list.
607007 Ooh, ooh, I know! Pick me!
60700d So what do you do now, Dashie?
60700c I have to report to Wonderbolts headquarters this afternoon. It's only two days 'til tour starts, and I need to learn the routine.
607000 [door opens]
607007 You're leaving already?! [gasps] But we barely started your congratulation party! I haven't even thought about your going-away party yet!
60700c Pinkie, I'm not leaving Ponyville. I just have to train for this show.
60700e I hope everything goes well. Sounds like an awful lot of pressure having to learn everything so quickly.
607008 Yeah. Good luck, Dash.
60700c Luck? Heh. Save that for the rest of the team.
607000 [snap]
60700c Now that my awesomeness has finally been recognized, the other Wonderbolts will have to keep up or eat my cloud trail!
607003 Everypony knows you're a great flyer, Rainbow Dash, but so are the rest of the Wonderbolts. It might be more challenging than you think.
60700c Aw, you're right! I mean, do I show up wearing sunglasses or not? Sunglasses are automatically cool, but anypony can put them on. Maybe I'd stand out more if I didn't.
607000 [engines roaring]
60707c Team briefings are every morning at—
60700c 0720, because there were twenty ponies in the original E.U.P. Guard that became the Wonderbolts!
60707c Right. And I know you've seen the academy bunks, but these are the official Wonderbolts barracks.
60700c Built by Admiral Fairweather himself!
607000 [thud]
60707c Don't forget rule number one, newbie. Always check both ways before crossing the runway.
60700c Uh, sure, but... nopony else is here.
60707c They will be, and most of the Wonderbolts like to make a flashy entrance, so stay alert.
60700c Right, no problem!
60700c Whoa! Is that General Flash's cap?!
60707c And the original crest with the Wonderbolts motto on it.
60732f "Altius volantis! Soaring higher!"
60700c Wow! [gasps] I mean, ha, cool.
60707c Okay, newbie, we've got a show in two days, which means you gotta hustle your haunches to learn this routine. You got five minutes to get dressed and get outside to meet the rest of the team.
60700c Yes, ma'am! I'll have all of the moves down by the end of the day!
60707c Let's hope so. We're all expecting you to make quite an impression.
607000 [zoom]
60700c Lookin' good! Okay, you're about to take your first flight as an actual Wonderbolt. [sighs] No pressure. [stretching groan] Just gotta go out there and knock 'em off their hooves. Okay, Wonderbolts, get ready to meet your most awesome member ever!
607000 [Wonderbolts chattering]
607000 [engines roaring]
60707c Hey, look out!
60700c Huh? Whooaaa!
607000 [crash, clatter]
60700c [unsteady groan]
607000 [Wonderbolts laughing]
60707a Whoa, most awesome entrance by a newbie ever.
60707b Are you okay, Rainbow Dash?
607219 More like Rainbow Crash.
607000 [Wonderbolts laughing]
6070b7 Okay, flight school! Get ready for Rainbow Dash! Hah—whooooa!
607000 [thud]
6070b7 [grunts]
607000 [crash]
607000 [trash can rolling]
6070b6 More like Rainbow Crash!
607000 [foals laughing]
607330 Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash! Rainbow Crash!
60700c Hey! You guys buzzed me on purpose!
60707c Not quite. You forgot rule number one, newbie.
607332 Always check both ways before crossing the runway.
60700c Yeah, well, I was just... testing you guys!
60721f [disbelieving laughter]
60707c Alright, nopony got hurt and we got a lot to do, so let's forget about this and get flying!
60707a Classic rookie move, Rainbow Crash. That was amazing.
607000 [jet engines roaring]
60707c [through loudhailer] Higher, Crash! You're breaking formation!
60707b Check your nine, Crash!
60707c Tighter, Crash, get in there!
60700c [growls] My name's not Crash!
607000 [thud]
607335 [yelps]
607334 Huh, could've fooled me.
607000 [locker door closes]
607219 Hey, Crash, I know it was a tough day today, but don't worry. You'll get the hang of it.
60700c Tough day? Please. If I can pull off a sonic rainboom, I can learn this routine. I'll have it down cold tomorrow. Probably even come up with a couple of improvements.
60707c Rainbow Dash, over here!
60700c Yes, ma'am!
60707c I'm glad you're still here.
60700c Oh, yeah? Did you want some ideas on how to make the show extra-awesome?
60707c Not quite. I know you've been a Reservist for a while, but the 'Bolts have a few of their own rules you might not know about. Like worst flyer of the day has to clean up the whole compound. Better get to it, Crash.
60700c [sighs] [under her breath] My name's not Crash.
607000 [door opens]
607000 [party cannon explodes]
607336 Surprise!
60700c What?
607080 Hooray, Rainbow Dash! Our favorite Wonderbolt!
607003 We know you're probably tired, Rainbow Dash, but Pinkie wanted to throw you a real party.
607007 Your best day [through megaphone] ever party!
60700c [nervous laugh] Yeah. It was somethin', all right.
607008 Well we can't wait to hear all about it!
60700c Heh. And I'd love to tell you, I really would, but I'm pretty beat. [yawns] You know, from all the... excitement of my big day?
60700e Um, is something wrong, Rainbow Dash?
60700c What could be wrong? I'm finally a Wonderbolt, which means everything has to be totally, perfectly awesome.
60700d Oh, no. Something is wrong. What happened, darling?
60700c I told you, it's nothing! I mean, maybe some of the Wonderbolts started calling me Rainbow Crash...
60700e Oh, no! Isn't that the same terrible nickname those bullies in flight school used to call you?
60700c [whimpering]
607003 Why would they call you that?
60700c Well, I kinda sorta fell into a garbage can. [whimpering]
607003 Urgh.
607007 Well, look at the bright side! At least they didn't call you Rainbow Trash!
607008 So you started off on the wrong hoof. I'll bet every new Wonderbolt has a tough first day.
60700d Mmm-hmm! What you need is to find a positive way to stand out. As soon as you're known for something else, that nasty old nickname will be forgotten.
607003 Rarity's right. Why don't you think of the Wonderbolts like us? We're a team, but we all stand out in different ways.
60700c That's it! I'm gonna stand out in a different way, just like you guys! Goodbye, Rainbow Crash; hello, Captain Awesome!
607000 [zoom]
60700c [imitating Pinkie Pie] Good morning, everypony! Who's ready for a fantastic day of flying? I know I am! I just couldn't be more excited for the big show tomorrow. Are you guys excited? I'm excited! Actually, I'm always excited! Some ponies even call me "Dynamic Dash"!
607000 [balloon pops]
60700c [imitating Pinkie Pie] Because I'm so full of energy all the time! [panting like a dog]
607219 Uh, Wonderbolts don't get excited, Crash. You gotta keep a level head to fly the way we do.
60700c [sighs] [imitating Applejack] Well, of course I know that! But the truth of the matter is, you should be excited! It's the dream of near every little Pegasus pony to grow up and fly with the Wonderbolts! And here you all are doin' it!
607219 So are you.
60700c [imitating Applejack] True! Go ahead and call me "Forthright Filly" if you want. But shee-yucks, I like to tell it like it is, and I believe a pony oughta appreciate hard work payin' off like this, because bein' a Wonderbolt is somethin' special!
60707a We know.
607000 [door slams]
607000 [whoosh]
60700c [imitating Twilight Sparkle] You know, I was just reading about how dihedral wing angles can help increase stability in banking turns. It made me think that pre-flight checklists could really help increase our efficiency, so I went ahead and made them for everypony!
607000 [papers flapping]
60700c [imitating Twilight Sparkle] I'm always finding so much interesting information in books. In fact, a lot of ponies call me "Reading Rainboom".
60707c [through loudhailer] We all know how wings work, newbie! And we already have checklists! Now get off the runway!
60700c [imitating Fluttershy] I'm so sorry. I was just trying to help because I care about all of the Wonderbolts oh-so much. Yessiree, just call me "Care Mare". [beat] Um, but if you're busy now, I can just come back later...
60707c [low growl]
60700c [imitating Fluttershy] Or, you know, not at all...
607000 [zip]
607000 [rubbing]
60700c [to herself] Okay. [imitating Rarity] I must tell you how much I just love these uniforms. Why, ever since I was a foal, I've admired the mixture of bold lines and classic contours. They don't call me "Rainbow Fash" for nothing.
60707b Uhhhh... huh...?
60700c [imitating Rarity] The "Fash" is for "Fashion".
60707c Crash! I'm not sure why you're acting like this, but you need to stop.
60700c I was just, you know, trying to show everypony all the awesome ways I can contribute to the 'Bolts.
60707c I know you're excited to find your place on the team, but just focus on the routine for now, okay?
60700c Yes, ma'am.
60707c Maybe this will help motivate you.
607000 [thud]
607000 [locker opens]
607000 [Wonderbolts motif plays]
60700c Crash?! Couldn't you just put my regular name on it?!
60707c That's not how it works around here. We all have our nicknames on our jackets. Right, Clipper?
60700c Clipper?
60707b Right, boss!
607000 [locker shuts]
60707c Now it's official. Welcome to the Wonderbolts, Crash! [laughs]
607000 [thud]
60700c [groans] If I don't come up with something unforgettable to add to the routine, I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash for the rest of my life!
607000 [locker shuts]
607065 This is gonna be so amazing!
607005 I know! I'm almost as excited as Pinkie Pie!
607007 I can't wait to see Rainbow Dash's first performance as an honest-to-goodness Wonderbolt! I hope there's cotton candy!
607000 [zip]
60700e We should all remember to be extra supportive for Rainbow Dash too.
60700d Excellent point. It's simply dreadful that she's had such a rough start after finally achieving her dream.
607003 Rainbow Dash is a pretty resilient pony. I'm sure she's shaken off her tough first day and turned it around by now!
607008 Speakin' of... Hey, Dash!
60700c Perfect! Hey, can I borrow Scootaloo?
607065 Me? What for?
60700c Oh, heh, I just needed some help and figured the president of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club was the right pony for the job!
607003 I thought the Wonderbolt Reserves were here to help.
60700c Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing, uh, official Reserve stuff. But don't worry! With Scootaloo's help, everything's gonna be awesome. Better than awesome!
60700d Does... Does that mean practice went well yesterday?
60700c Gotta go.
607065 What are we doing up here, Rainbow Dash?
60700c I just need a small favor from you that's really gonna make this show something special. Now, the Wonderbolts are gonna fly over this ridge right before the finale of the show. I'll fly by last, and when I signal you, you zip up the ramp on your scooter and kick the storm cloud into my path!
607065 What?
60700c That kick will shoot off a lightning bolt right behind me, making me look totally awesome! And then I'll do some incredible Rainbow Dash flying with it to create the coolest, show-stoppingest, lightning-tastic light show anypony has ever seen!
607065 Are you sure about this?
60700c Uh-huh! It's gonna be so awesome! And nopony will ever call me "Rainbow Crash" after this!
607000 [engines roaring]
60700c Oh, gotta go! Be ready for me, okay, Scootaloo?
607065 Um... okay...?
607124 [through loudspeaker] Mares and gentlecolts, fillies and foals of all ages! Look to the skies and prepare to be awestruck by the incredible flying prowess of... the Wonderbolts!
607000 [engines roaring]
607000 [crowd cheering]
60700e I hope Spike and Pinkie Pie are done getting their snacks, or they're gonna miss Rainbow Dash!
60700d Oh, don't worry, Fluttershy. Nothing would keep Pinkie Pie from missing this!
607008 Heh. Except maybe cotton candy.
607000 [engines roaring]
607005 Come on, Pinkie, the show's starting!
607007 One second! Just a little bit bigger please, but hurry! Bigger!
607000 [engines roaring]
607000 [crowd awed]
607000 [fighter plane engine whines]
607000 [crowd cheers]
607003 That was amazing! She's doing great!
607007 Bigger!
607000 [cotton candy stretching]
607005 [sighs]
607000 [whooshing]
607000 [screeching]
607065 I hope this works.
607000 [thwack]
607000 [crowd cheering]
607000 [storm cloud crackling]
60700c [yelps]
607000 [storm cloud crackling]
607000 [leaves being dislodged]
60700c [multiple yelps]
6070ec [gasps]
60700c [grunts, screams]
607000 [crash]
60700c [grunts, screams]
607000 [lightning]
607000 [downed fighter plane engine noise]
607007 Hope I'm not too late. [scoffs] I dunno what took that pony so long.
60700c [screams]
607000 [splat]
60700c [groans]
607007 That was amazing!
60707c Way to go, Rainbow Crash.
60700c [sighs]
60707c You gonna tell us what just happened, newbie?
60700c [sighs] I'm so sorry.
60707c I should hope so. You changed the routine without consulting me and put other ponies at risk. I've drummed flyers out of the 'Bolts for less.
60700c I know, and I'm ready for whatever punishment you want. You guys were right to call me "Rainbow Crash". I've always been a standout flyer, but since I joined the Wonderbolts, I've only stood out for making mistakes. [sighs] It's been my dream my whole life, but... I guess maybe I'm not Wonderbolt material after all.
60707b Are you serious?! You're the most talented flyer we've ever had!
607219 And you've saved all of Equestria like, a dozen times.
60700c Uh, I—
60707c Of course you're supposed to be a Wonderbolt. We've been waiting for a spot to open up ever since you joined the Reserves!
60700c But... you guys all called me Rainbow Crash.
60707b Yeah, so? My nickname's "Clipper". You know why they call me that?
60700c Uh... 'cause you're as fast as a ship?
60707b Because I clipped my wing on a flagpole as I was landing on my first day. Heh.
60700c Huh.
607219 "Flatfoot". My first day, I misjudged my landing and came down right on Spitfire's hoof.
60707a "Dizzy".
607334 "Slowpoke".
607333 "Hoof-in-Mouth".
60707c You don't wanna know what they call me. [unintelligible whisper]
60700c Whoa! That is so much worse than Crash.
60707c Right?
60700c So does this mean I'm... still on the team?
60707c Do you think you can be part of this team and not constantly try to showboat?
60700c I promise! I spent my whole life trying to be a standout flyer, but now that I'm a Wonderbolt, it's time to be okay with fitting in!
60707c Good, because I really didn't want to miss the chance to tease you for years about this catastrophe! I mean, that crash was epic!
607000 [Wonderbolts laughing]
60707c But you're on probation for a month. Got a problem with that?!
60700c [quickly] No, ma'am.
607000 [sweeping]
607003 Hey. Rainbow Dash. We just wanted to check on you. Are you doing okay?
60700c I'm doing great, thanks!
607065 Sure you don't need any help?
60700c Nah. This mess is my responsibility, and I've gotta clean it up myself. And after this, Spitfire's got me cleaning the Wonderbolts' compound for the next month.
607065 So why are you in such a good mood?
60700c Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!

60800f Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
608003 Hey, Starlight! Ready to celebrate your first Hearth's Warming Eve here in Ponyville?
60827c I was thinking I might just skip it.
608049 [gasp]
608000 [theme song]
608005 Skip Hearth's Warming Eve?!
60827c I just find it all a little silly. It's mostly a day dedicated to presents and candy, isn't it?
608005 And why would you deny yourself presents and candy? That's crazy talk!
608003 I think what Spike means to say is Hearth's Warming is about more than presents and candy. It's a time to spend with friends and family when we celebrate a very important day in Equestria's history.
60827c I think to most ponies, it's just an excuse for silly songs and fun, not a day to remember some old story.
608000 [magic zap]
608003 Maybe you just haven't heard the right Hearth's Warming Eve story yet!
60827c Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns sing songs around a hearth to fight back an eternal winter caused by the mythical windigos? Ha! Every foal and filly knows that story.
608003 Not that one. My favorite holiday story, "A Hearth's Warming Tale"!
608005 Oh, I love that one!
608003 This is the story of a powerful unicorn named Snowfall Frost, who hated Hearth's Warming Eve. It all began many moons ago in Canterlot...
608003 [narrating] Every home in Canterlot was filled with holiday spirit. Every home... except one. It was said of Snowfall that she was almost as studied as Star Swirl the Bearded. Almost, since everypony knows that Star Swirl was an expert at everything from transfiguration, dimensional calibration, teleportation—
608005 [narrating] We get it. Star Swirl's awesome.
608003 [narrating] Right. The point is, Snowfall was also a powerful unicorn. She wanted to be perfect. Anything that got in the way of that was a waste of time.
608000 [bells ringing]
60827c [gasp] Well, that batch is ruined. Snowdash!
608003 [narrating] Snowdash was Snowfall's loyal assistant.
60800c What do you need?
60827c Get this mess cleaned up. Those foolish ponies were ringing those blasted bells outside the window and I lost my concentration!
60800c [under her breath] Whoa, ponies actually enjoying Hearth's Warming Eve. Where did they get that crazy idea?
60827c Today is nothing to celebrate. Hearth's Warming Eve is a menace. A dangerous day for all of Equestria.
60800c Dangerous?! It's awesome! It's the day we remember how unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies came together in friendship to defeat the windigos!
60827c That silly legend is the problem! Telling everypony that "singing songs and being nice" will solve anything? I've spent years studying magic, and that's not how it works.
60800c I think you might be missing the point.
608000 [magic zap]
60827c Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria. That's a worthy goal for any pony. [sarcastically] But, by all means, if you want to go home early, ignore all of the work you have, and spend the rest—
60800c Sweet!
60827c Ugh!
608000 [crowd chattering]
60827c I hate Hearth's Warming Eve! All of Equestria would be better off if we just skipped the day altogether.
60827c [Starlight Glimmer]
60827c Happy Hearth's Warming, they say in the street
60827c Happy Hearth's Warming, they think they're so sweet
60827c Words said so often that they lack any meaning
60827c Why should I join in when I could be intervening?
60827c Everypony loves this cursed holiday
60827c But would they be better off with it out of the way?
60827c Well, okay
60827c Say goodbye to the holiday
60827c With my magic, I'll erase it
60827c The greatest gift that I give today
60827c And everypony will have to face it
60827c No more little games for you to play
60827c After you say goodbye to the holiday
60827c Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, you had a good run
60827c Goodbye, Hearth's Warming, it's over, you're done
60827c Finally set free from your forced celebrations
60827c No need to reply to your trite invitations
60827c Calendar shorter by a single day
60827c Is my magic up to the test?
60827c Time to see, I can't delay
60827c Say goodbye to the holiday
60827c Prepare the spell, no hesitation
60827c All memory shall fade away
60827c See Equestria's new transformation
60827c No more shall anypony say
60827c Happy Hearth's Warming...
608000 [sinister laughter]
608000 ...after today!
608000 After today...
60827c Once the spell is cast, all of Equestria will be better off, and they'll have me to thank for it!
60827c Wait a minute. Snowfall doesn't like Hearth's Warming Eve so she decides to cast a spell to get rid of it altogether? That seems a little extreme.
608005 [muttering] Says the pony who tried to make everypony the same by replacing their cutie marks with equal signs. [sips cocoa]
608003 I think what Spike is trying to say is that everypony has their reasons for doing things. Even Snowfall. And if I could continue the story, we might just find out what they are.
608005 Proceed.
608003 Snowfall was all set to cast her spell that would erase Hearth's Warming Eve for all time...
608003 [narrating] ...when a voice from the hearth caught her attention.
608008 You sure you wanna go through with this?
60827c Huh?! Who's there?!
608000 [bubbling]
608008 The Spirit of Hearth's Warmin' Past, that's who. And you and me have got to have us a little chat.
60827c A spirit?! [suspiciously] I didn't cast any spirit summoning spell. What are you doing here?
608008 You don't think a spell like that would get by without some powerful forces noticin'? You've got our attention, Snowfall Frost, and we've got some pretty strong opinions on this spell of yours.
60827c "We"?
608008 They'll be along in a bit. For now, it's just you and me. Let's get a move on. We got a ton to see and barely any time to see it.
60827c I'm not going anywhere. I've got a spell to cast, and I don't need a history lesson about Hearth's Warming Eve.
608008 We aren't goin' to the past to learn about the holiday. We're goin' to learn about you.
60827c [yelps] [wailing]
608008 [Applejack]
608008 As a young thing, life sure is somethin'
608008 You go makin' choices large and small
608008 Always growin' like a seedlin'
608008 And playin' is like dreamin'
608008 And before you know it, big and tall
608008 And every little bitty choice you make
608008 Sends you down a path to who you are today
608008 So let's take a little trip down memory lane
608008 And see just what the past has to say
608008 Aw, look how cute you were. Looks like you're not too upset it's Hearth's Warming Eve either.
608008 The seeds of the past
608008 They grow pretty fast
608008 Just look at who you were back then
608008 The seeds, as they grow
608008 Look what they can show
608008 Reveal the truth time and again
608337 Just what do you think you're doing, Snowfall?
608338 Decorating the classroom for Hearth's Warming Eve, Professor Flintheart!
608337 You said you wanted to learn to be a powerful unicorn, did you not?
608338 I do!
608337 And what is the way that one becomes a powerful unicorn?
608338 [clears throat] Work hard, learn, and use your skills to better Equestria.
608337 And how do these help you to learn magic?
608338 I want to be strong enough to stop windigos and help ponies!
608337 That's just a story we tell little ponies. Real magic takes time to learn.
608000 [ornament shattering]
608337 It's your choice. Spend your time learning to become a powerful unicorn or play with your toys and make nothing of yourself.
608008 [Applejack]
608008 Then some distress, words so careless
608008 Standin' there, you don't know what to do
608008 Feelin' helpless, you can't make it hurt less
608008 So you go and change your point of view
608008 And in that moment, though you didn't know it
608008 Your defenses set up walls you built to last
608008 Leading to the pony you've become today
608008 And the spell you're about to cast
608008 It all comes from your past
60827c [Starlight Glimmer]
60827c The seeds of the past
60827c We grow up so fast
60827c Some hurts never go away
608008 [Applejack]
608008 The seeds, as they grow
608008 This we can't let go
608008 All tied to this one holiday
608000 [bubbling]
60827c [gasps] Spirit? What am I supposed to—
608000 [sound of confetti launching]
608007 [reverberating] Snowfall Frost! It is I, the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents!
60827c Um, don't you mean "Present", like the time?
608007 No! Toys, Hearth's Warming doll... Here, want a cupcake?
60827c Fine, "Presents". All of the pointless things ponies waste their time on.
608007 Oh, Snowfall, it's not what the gift is that matters, it's what the gift means!
60827c It doesn't mean anything. It's just stuff!
608007 Exactly! Sometimes a cupcake means "I love you!" Or a toy means "Hi, how're you doing?" Sometimes a book means "Your mane looks amazing!" And sometimes a scarf means... Well, a scarf usually means you look cold. That one's easy.
60827c I don't understand anything you're saying.
608007 Whoa! Whoa! [trembles]
60827c What's happening to you?!
608007 My Spirit of Hearth's Warming Presents Sense is going off! That means a song is coming on!
608007 [Pinkie Pie]
608007 Take a look at everything around you
608007 All the smells that surely will astound you
608007 Open up your heart, it will surround you
608007 In the magic of Hearth's Warming Eve
608007 The little things that make it better
608007 Little ponies spreading cheer
608007 Give a toy, a hug, a sweater
608007 Memories that last all year
608007 The present's always filled with presents
608007 Large, medium, and small
608007 Sometimes the most important things
608007 Aren't very big at all
608000 [tap-dancing solo]
608000 What a party, there's so much to see here
608000 Can't believe you didn't want to be here
608000 You'd have had a blast, I guarantee here
608000 This is the spirit of Hearth's Warming Eve
608000 Cider's flowing, this is living
608000 Come on and feel the beat
608000 Life is better when you're giving
608000 Each time you do it feels so sweet
608000 The present's always filled with presents
608000 So come on, open your eyes
608000 Spend time with ponies just like you
608000 And watch your spirits rise
608000 The present's always filled with presents
608000 Take a look around
608000 The reason for the holiday
608000 Is quite easily found
608000 Yes, the reason for the holiday
608000 Is quite easily found
608000 And the reason is to be with your friends!
608003 [singsong, as Pinkie Pie] And the reason is to be with your friends! [normal] What?
60827c You know you're doing your Pinkie Pie voice, right?
608003 I was not!
608005 [laughing]
60827c So, what happens next?
608003 Well, the party was—
608005 Wait! Can we take a quick break? I need to refill my cocoa.
608003 [groans] Fine. But hurry up! We're almost to the best part!
608005 [blows] Okay, I'm ready.
608003 The party was in full swing.
60800d Snowdash!
60800c Hey, Merry.
60800d Why, whatever is the matter, darling?
60800e Was it the eggnog? Oh, I knew I put in too much cinnamon!
60800c Oh, no, the eggnog was awesome, Flutterholly, I'm just mad at somepony who was complaining about how awful Hearth's Warming Eve is.
60800d I don't suppose that pony's name starts with "Snow"?
60800e And ends with "Frost"?
60800c She said Hearth's Warming Eve is just an excuse to party, and we would all be better off spending time working to make Equestria a better place.
6080ec [booing]
60800d What does Snowfall think a better Equestria looks like?
60800c Ponies working hard, learning, and using their abilities for the benefit of Equestria.
60807e [giggling]
608000 [thunk]
608000 [foals laughing]
60800d [muffled] It looks like we've got everything on Snowfall's list right here.
60800e I think a perfect Equestria looks a lot like a Hearth's Warming Eve party.
608007 Me too! Too bad it's going to be the last one ever! Ever! Ever! Ever! [echoes out]
60827c Spirit? What do you mean? What's going to happen?!
608000 [wind blowing]
60827c Who are you?
60801a I am the Spirit of Hearth's Warming Yet to Come.
60827c Are you here to show me what future Hearth's Warming Eves are like?
60801a No, for there are no more Hearth's Warming Eves for me to show.
60827c Why not?
60801a You will succeed in erasing the holiday, as you wished.
60827c And what happens?
60801a [Princess Luna]
60801a I see a cold wind blowing through
60801a I see days neither fun nor free
60801a I see a future caused by you
60801a I see a path not meant to be
60801a The future should be filled with magic
60801a Dreams and wishes brought to life
60801a But the days ahead are dark and tragic
60801a No time for hope when all is strife
60801a Whatever might have been
60801a All the dreams that ponies share
60801a Because of you, Snowfall Frost
60801a Now the future is a cold nightmare
60827c Windigos?! They aren't real! It's just a little filly's story!
60801a They are all too real, Snowfall, and your actions will allow them to return. The future of Equestria shall be bathed in a blanket of eternal snow!
60827c No! I never meant for this to happen! I didn't understand! I didn't see how important Hearth's Warming Eve was! Please, spirit! I haven't cast the spell yet! Is there still time?! I'm sorry! [echoing]
608000 [window opens]
608000 [bell ringing]
60827c There's still time!
608000 [party crowd chattering]
608000 [knocking]
608000 [door opens]
60800d Oh, my.
60800e Snowfall Frost?
60827c I was hoping I wasn't too late for the party? I brought gifts.
608000 [record needle scratch]
60800c [spit-take] Boss?!
60827c I was wrong earlier, about Hearth's Warming Eve. It's not all about singing and presents. The singing and presents are all about celebrating the ponies in our lives. The ponies we should listen to more often - our friends.
60800c Wow.
608000 [rip]
60800c Dragon toenail? Uh... thanks?
60827c I was in a hurry. I'll do better next time.
60800c Ha. You kidding? No one's ever given me dragon toenail before! It's awesome! Now come get some eggnog!
608003 [narrating] And from then on, it was always said of all the Hearth's Warming Eve celebrations, Snowfall's was the Hearth's Warmingest.
608003 The end.
608000 [book closes]
608003 Well, that's it! Thanks for letting me read you the story. Guess you can call it a night. Spike and I are heading downstairs, and if you wanted to, you'd be welcome to join us.
608000 [ponies laughing]
608003 Welcome to the party! Happy Hearth's Warming, Starlight.
60827c Happy Hearth's Warming, Twilight.
60827c [Starlight Glimmer]
60827c Hearth's Warming Eve is filled with presents
60827c Some take you by surprise
60827c A story shared by your good friends
60827c That makes your spirits rise
60827c Sometimes you just let go of the past
60827c Enjoy the present while it lasts
60827c And really it's not that much to ask
60827c With good friends by your side
60827c Now it's time to celebrate
60800f [Ponies]
60800f Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
60827c [Starlight Glimmer]
60827c All together, feeling great
60800f [Ponies]
60800f Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again
60827c [Starlight Glimmer]
60827c Can hardly wait
60827c We'll party 'til late
60827c Our favorite date
60800f [Ponies]
60800f Hearth's Warming Eve is here once a—
60800f Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve
60800f Happy, happy Hearth's Warming Eve
60800f Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
608000 [instrumental of "Pinkie's Present" plays over credits]
60900c [panting] Come on! If we hurry, we can get there before the paper's even delivered to Rarity's house!
609007 Maybe she won't read the article.
609008 I'm pretty sure Rarity's gonna read a review of her new boutique in Manehattan.
60900c I still can't believe we all just blabbed everything that happened to that reporter!
60900e I just hope it doesn't end up being an article about how her friends almost ruined the opening.
609003 I think you're all overreacting. Rarity's our friend. If anypony is gonna understand, it'll be her.
609000 [door opens]
60900d [grimly] I was wondering when all of you were going to show up.
6091a0 [gasp]
60900d [excitedly] Now we can all read the review together!
60900c Um, I have an idea. How 'bout we don't read it?
609003 What she means is, before you read it, we should probably tell you about—
60900d No, no, darling. Please, no spoilers.
60900e But—
60900d No spoilers!
609000 [theme song]
60900d Now, is everypony ready to hear what I'm sure is a stellar review that describes in stunning detail exactly how each of you contributed to the successful opening of Rarity For You?
609000 [zip]
60900d [clears throat, reading] "Many a pony has tried their hoof at joining the ranks of the elite fashion trendsetters currently ensconced in the boutiques of Manehattan's famed Saddle Row." [giggles, continues reading] "Some might say it's the ultimate achievement in Equestrian fashion, and never before has a reporter been granted such unfettered behind-the-scenes access until now!"
60900e I wish it had been more fettered.
60900d Oh, uh... [mutters] Ah! [reading] "I sat down with..." [giggles, continues reading] "...Rarity and her friends after the opening to get the inside scoop, and what a scoop it was!"
609339 Okay, kid, ya successfully opened a shop in Manehattan and that's no mean feat! Most ponies might wonder what it feels like. Here's how it's gonna be - I'm gonna interview you and your friends so I can paint a picture of how it all came together. A word picture, mind you, not an actual picture. Any questions?
60900d Well, I was wondering—
609339 Let's get started! Ms. Rarity, you've got shops all over Equestria, but this was your first time trying to make it in the big city. What made ya think you could tackle it on your own?
60900d Well, I wouldn't say all over Equestria. I just have two other boutiques - one in my hometown of Ponyville, and one in Canterlot. Uh, still, when I decided to open this one, I was nothing but confident.
609000 [bell dings]
609003 Let's just say that if I could choose, I probably wouldn't do it that way again. Heh.
609007 Well, it wasn't the funnest party ever...
609008 It was a plum-puckered, pig-pushin' disaster!
60900c After a lifetime of awesome, I think everypony's allowed to mess up every now and then, right?
609000 [pencil writing]
60900c Wait, are you writing this down?
60900e Um, it didn't go exactly how I thought it would, but it, um, started out all right.
60900d Welcome to Saddle Row, an entire street lined with the most fashionable boutiques in all of Equestria!
609008 If it's supposed to be the most fashionable block of shops, where's Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium?
60900d I suppose it didn't make the cut. [gasps] Here it is! Rarity For You!
609000 [door opens]
609000 [shelf breaks]
609000 [mouse squeaks]
609003 Rarity, it's lovely. But are you sure you'll be ready to open tonight?
609007 [inhales] [sneezes]
60900d No need to fret over a mere moderate amount of preparation. My clothes arrive soon, my sales associate after that, and with a little... dusting, we'll be ready for the grand opening tonight.
60933a Rarity! So good to see you! Your store, it's going to be a very good place, I think! [laughs]
60900d Mr Stripes owns the building. He's a very pleasant landlord. Although he can be pushy at times. [beat] Okay, all the time.
60933a You've met my daughter, the apple of my ear, the hay in my hoof? You will let her work with you.
60900d [chuckles nervously] It's just, I'm dreadfully busy preparing for tonight's grand opening, as you can see.
60933a There are only two things I love more than being pushy. One is my daughter. The other is miniature doll furniture. And I would sell my entire mini-furniture collection to make my daughter happy. You understand?
609000 [poit, poit, poit]
60900d I'm sorry. I just don't think it's going to be possible.
60933a Let me say another way... Hire her or I raise rent until you no can afford!
60900d Oh, uh, welcome aboard.
60933b [loudly] First idea! Instead of clothes, we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth! Like this. [chomp, chomp] But they glow in the dark!
60900d Golly, what a splendid idea! [chuckles nervously]
60900d Glow-in-the-dark teeth! What was she thinking?!
60900d Aah! Fluttershy, your assistance is required in the stock room, posthaste!
60900e Aw, hello.
60900d But what are they doing here?
609000 [raccoons chittering]
60900e Smoky made too much noise eating garbage, so Softpad's mother made them move out of the trashcan.
60900e Then Smoky Jr. found a nice home in the crawl space behind the building. But Mr Stripes demolished it, so they were temporarily camped out in the back until they found a new place to live.
60900d No, no, no! I can't have a family of rubbish-scented raccoons living in my boutique!
609000 [dance music playing, chandelier creaks]
60900d Uh, did you hear that?
60900d [annoyed] Heh. Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs.
609007 [excitedly] Turns out there's a Club Pony Party Palace upstairs!
609000 [dance music continues]
60900d I'm sorry. Could you please ask her to turn it down? Could you ask her to turn it down, please? [pleading] Turn it down, please! [sobbing] Oh, please!
60900d Ugh! Foals today listen to their so-called "music" far too loud. I realize that makes me sound like an old mare. But this is business!
609000 [sweeping]
609000 [dance music playing, chandelier creaking]
60900c I wish we were having as much fun as they are.
609003 Well, sweeping can be fun, too. [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep. Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep...
60900c Only Twilight could make a dance remix about sweeping. I mean, how lame is that?
609008 Yeah. It wasn't even catchy.
60900c Nope.
609000 [hoof-bump]
609003 [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep...
60906b [to the beat] Sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep, sweep...
60900d Apparently, DJ Pon-3 has a residency at the Party Palace upstairs, but security won't let me speak to her.
609000 [honk!]
60900d Aah! What in the name of Celestia was that?!
60933b You know how most stores have a little jingle-bell when the door opens? Ahem. I thought we should have something with a little more pizzazz! So, I installed one of Daddy's antique horns.
609000 [honk! honk! honk!]
60900d [sighs] We'll have to do something about that, after I think of a way to quiet down that music. And after I finish designing the window display!
609000 [crash!]
60900d Ahh! Wait, is this my merchandise shipment from Ponyville? It's completely disorganized! A—A—... [sighs]
60920e [sneezes]
60900d Gesundheit! Oh, Miss Pommel! I'm so glad to see you! Now, as the sole sales associate at Rarity For You, I hate to add to your already overflowing plate of responsibilities, but it looks as though we have just a tad more to do before tonight than I thought.
60920e Actually, I— [sneezes] I can't work tonight.
60900d Oh? Why not?
60920e [blowing nose]
60920e [sneezes]
60900d Feel better, my sweet. We'll manage without you... somehow. And we'll manage glowing teeth and car horns and disorganized clothes and dance music! Am I forgetting anything?
609000 [raccoons chittering]
60900d [sobbing] What am I going to do?!
609003 Well, opening a store in Manehattan is a pretty big deal. It's natural that Rarity would be a little stressed about how it was going. Since it wasn't going well. Still, I think she handled it all right.
60900d My dream is doomed! Doomed, I tell you! Doomed!
609003 I know things haven't gone perfectly so far, but we've done this kind of thing before. If we all work together—
60900d I appreciate the offer, but this is Manehattan. To make it in the fashion scene here, everything has to be perfect. The perfect location! The perfect clothes! The perfect opening!
609003 Maybe we should just postpone.
60900d Postpone?! Darling, tonight is the last night of the fall season. If we don't open tonight, it won't be...
609003 [sighs] Perfect.
60900d Yes. I know what needs to be done. I just need more of me! Oh, how I wish I could make copies of myself!
609007 Yeah... Making copies of yourself always sounds like a great idea, but before you know it, you're locked in a room with fifty Pinkie Pies watching paint dry.
609000 [syrup splashes]
609003 We can do this. And we can stay true to your vision.
60900d You'd do that? Fluttershy, you'll handle those... strong-smelling raccoons for me?
60900e Of course.
609008 Leave Plaid Stripes to me. I'll handle her and her, uh, "good ideas".
609007 Ooh, ooh, ooh! And I can go upstairs to that nonstop party and have tons of fun and eat some cake and set off party cannons and—
60900d [clears throat]
609007 And then make them be quiet.
609003 I'm pretty sure I know somepony who wouldn't mind organizing this merchandise shipment for you. [beat] I'm talking about myself. [beat] [pleading] Oh, please, let me organize it!
60900d This all sounds splendid, but I don't even have a single employee, and I'll need the best of the best.
60900c Leave the hiring to me.
60900d Oh! This is it, my dears. If you can handle these problems, I'll focus on the designs for the front window display. We'll show Manehattan what Rarity For You is all about! Oh, what would I do without you?
60900c What would she do without us? Huh. Lemme think. [imitating Rarity] "Darlings, I'm absolutely doomed, doomed, doomed!" [laughs, normal voice] Heh, I sound just like her!
609000 [pencil scratching]
60900c Hey, you're not writing this down, are you?
60900d Now for the perfect window display. Hmm.
609000 [dance music playing]
609007 Oh, I can't really stop a super fun party in the middle of mega-happy fun times, can I?! Oh, what would Rarity want?!
60933c Keep that party going 'til the break of dawn!
609007 Really?
60933d Indubitably! And as for the roof, get jiggy! Raise it, Pinkie! Raise it like you've never raised it before!
609007 Oh! If you say so!
60933c Oh, please, Pinkie Pie. Never in a million years would I say such balderdash!
609000 [poof]
609000 [poof]
609007 Oh.
609000 [screech]
609007 Obviously, DJ Pon-3 only plays the sickest of beats. I just wouldn't want her to miss out on the coolest new music straight from the back-alley underground, zip-zap party scene! [to DJ Pon-3] I'd play the whole thing if I were you, no matter what other ponies think.
609000 [record scratches]
609000 [shopping music plays]
60933e Awww.
60900c Rarity For You is only hiring the best of the best. And to me, that means the fastest. Now, uh, before we begin, uh... [to herself] Am I doing this right? What would Rarity want? [to applicants] New plan!
609000 [zip!]
60900c Who can be the first one to tell me what fabric this is?
60933f That's organza.
60900c Are you sure?
60933f It's a thin, plain weave. Sheer fabric traditionally made from silk, so... yeah.
60900c I don't know the first thing about clothes. Pretty much all I can do is look at something and tell you if it's clothes or not. This chair? Not clothes.
60933b See if you can keep up with me here. What are all clothes made of?
609008 Uh, fabric?
60933b Bingo! But not in this store. Uh-uh. Not anymore.
609008 Oh, no?
60933b Two words for you - "spoon clothes". All our clothes will be made of spoons!
609008 [sighs, to herself] What would Rarity want? [to Plaid Stripes] You know, I like you, Plaid Stripes. If it were up to me, we'd have a spoon clothes store right next to Stinky Bottom's Discount Hat Emporium. But it ain't up to me, so the answer is no.
609008 Personally, I think spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea. Useful, too. Eatin' soup, stirrin' gumbo, diggin' little holes.
609003 There. Perfect. Although, what would Rarity want? Maybe she wouldn't like it done by color. Guess I have to start over!
60900e Hello, Smoky, Softpad, Smoky Jr.? I have some... interesting news. I, oh... I'd like you all to stay here forever, but... [to herself] What would Rarity want? [to the raccoons] You have to move out! [sobs]
609000 [raccoons shriek]
60900d A window display is the first thing customers see, and if they like it, they'll walk inside and experience the glory that is my boutique.
60900c [stammers] I don't know which one of you to hire! Just... keep guessing fabrics!
60933b Daddy, Rarity's friend doesn't like my ideas!
60933a Spoon clothes is good idea!
609000 [dance music playing]
609007 Oh, no! Not a shopping music mashup!
609000 [raccoons growling]
60900e I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
609000 [knob jiggles]
609003 [gasps]
609000 [slow motion sounds]
60900d How's it—
609000 [door slams]
60900d Ooh!
60900e When you write the story, could you maybe skip over the part where we locked Rarity in the window display? [nervous chuckle]
60900d Hello? The door appears to be stuck!
609003 Yep. We're workin' on it!
60900d Hmm. Well, shouldn't let this time go to waste.
609000 [ponies chattering and raccoons chittering]
609003 How did this happen?
609007 I shut down the party.
609008 I told Plaid Stripes no.
60900e I asked the raccoons to leave.
60900c I asked a lot of fabric questions.
60906d Just like I thought Rarity would want!
609003 Rarity asked us to help her with everything because she knows all of us so well. [to Fluttershy] She knows how much you care for animals. She'd trust you to solve the problem your way. [to the others] Maybe we should all do the same. Doing this our way is what Rarity wants. It's not too late. Let's all dig in and we can fix this.
609000 [ponies chattering]
609003 Before Rarity finds out how bad we messed up.
60900e I'm sorry I asked you to leave. The place is yours if you wanna stay. Though I would like to ask you all just one favor.
609007 I'm sorry I made you play that un-fun, super-boring music. But if you're up for it, I have an idea to make the party even better!
60900c Okay, I don't get fabric, but I do get speed. And I need somepony fast enough to help all the customers Rarity's gonna have. So... first one to the river and back gets the job! [beat] It's a race! Go!
609008 [clears throat] Mr Stripes, I owe your daughter an apology. She's got good ideas, and I should give 'em a chance. So here's what I'm thinkin'.
609000 [taxi rattling]
60900d Perfect!
609000 [doorknob rattling]
609000 [door opens]
609000 [thump]
609003 [awkwardly] Wow, looks like we fixed that door just in time!
60900d [gasps] Oh! What's all this?
609003 The whole place organized by style, cross-referenced by size, and reverse-indexed by fabric. She'll be able to find anything in three seconds flat! It was some of my best work.
60900d Oh! I knew I could count on you! All right... I suppose this is the moment of truth...
609000 [door opens, bell rings]
60900d Rarity For You is now open!
609000 [ponies chattering]
60900d Oh, dear. I wasn't quite prepared for such a crowd. How will I handle them all?
60933f My name's Blue Bobbin. I'll be your personal shopping assistant this evening.
60900c Right this way, everypony, and one of our talented salesponies can help you out!
60900c Honestly, they were all pretty slow. But they finished the race. Plus they knew a lot more about fabric than I did. So, I hired them all!
609000 [music starts]
609007 The way I see it, Rarity designs fashion, DJ Pon-3 designs beats. What better combination than a boutique/dance club?
60900e After a quick bath, they were more than willing to help!
609000 [splat]
609340 Ah, a blue corn reduction with shallot confit! But how can I possibly enjoy it without a—
60933b Spoon?
609008 Heh. Toldja spoon clothes ain't such a bad idea.
609340 [sips] Mmm! Exquisite! This is the most whimsical and wonderfully fashionable boutique I've ever seen!
609000 [ponies chattering]
60900d [reading] "In the end, Rarity's grand opening was a smashing success! True, it got off to a rocky start, but somehow this rag-tag group of ne'er-do-wells..." [to ponies] Oh, heavens, I think he means you. [continues reading] "...came together and created the perfect boutique. A vision of Rarity combined with the expertise of her friends! This reporter, for one, is a believer." [to ponies] Why didn't you tell me there were so many problems?
609003 We all figured you had enough on your mind.
609008 And we didn't want you to think that the opening wasn't perfect.
60900d [giggles] "Ne'er-do-wells" or not, I know I can always count on all of you. And nothing could be more perfect than that.
60933b [sipping]
609000 [credits]
610000 [steam hisses]
61000d [sighs]
610282 Um... Miss Rarity? Eh, how much longer are you planning to stay in here, darling?
61000d Oh, dear. Is somepony else waiting?
610282 Oh, no, no. I just don't want you to get all... What is word? Pruney.
61000d Oh. Uh, well, I'm just waiting for Applejack. It's been so long since we've had a relaxing day at the spa together. I'm quite certain she'll be along any moment.
610000 [door closes]
610000 [steam hisses]
610000 [door opens]
610008 Hey, there, Rarity. I really tried to get here earlier. I just can't believe how much time my chores are takin' up these days. At least now we'll finally get to spend some quality spa time together. Right?
610282 Okay, fillies, that's it. We are closing up for the day.
610000 [door closes]
610008 Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess I missed the whole day. I sure am sorry.
61000d Me, too.
610000 [theme song]
610003 Hi, Rarity!
61000d Morning, Twilight, Spike. Good heavens, that's a lot of empty pie plates.
610005 Uh... yeah. We were just heading to pick up some fresh pies. Heh. I don't know why we keep running out at the castle. [nervous laugh] What are you gonna get?
61000d Applejack, actually. Although, I'm quite sure she'll be too busy once again.
610003 What do you mean?
61000d Oh, nothing. It's just that Applejack and I haven't had one of our spa days in ages.
610003 You two really should set aside some time.
61000d Darling, I have been trying for moons! But Applejack is so busy these days, it's next to impossible.
610003 Wow. I didn't realize Applejack had so much to do.
610000 [timer buzzes]
610000 [oven door opens]
610000 [oven door closes]
610005 Hey, Applejack! Another order of pies, please.
610008 Sure thing, Spike!
610005 Aah! Dah! Whoa-oa-oa!
61000d I don't suppose those pies are the last chore on the schedule for today?
610008 Gah! Land's sakes! Is it time for our spa day already? Rarity, why don't you go on ahead and I'll meet ya there?
61000d Oh! Please, Applejack, let's not kid ourselves!
610008 Well, it ain't 'cause I don't wanna. But the work on the farm has just been takin' up more and more of my time.
610003 I hate seeing you two not spending time together. Can't you get somepony else in your family to take over for a bit?
610008 [sighs] Wish I could. But Granny, Big Mac, and Apple Bloom all have chores of their own. And today, they're all busy takin' the harvest to market.
610003 I know we're not farmers, but I'm sure Spike and I could handle things for a little while.
610008 Maybe...
610003 Is there one chore we could do?
610008 Well... I suppose if you two got started on feedin' the pigs, I could maybe leave for an hour.
61000d Oooh! An hour of spa perfection? I can work with that!
610003 Perfect! You head out to the spa, and Spike and I'll take care of things here.
610000 [pie plates rattling]
610005 Whoa! Dah! Whoa!
610000 [whoosh]
610005 Uh, yeah. We totally got everything covered.
610008 [sighs] Okay. This list pretty much covers everything you need to know to feed the pigs. But, uh, maybe I should go over it with you just to...
610003 Applejack, please. If there's a list involved, I am one hundred percent on top of it.
610008 Uh, right.
610003 And don't worry about things here! Spike and I have totally got this! I mean, it's just feeding the pigs. How hard could it be?
610005 Uh, Twilight?
610003 Whoa.
610008 I'm glad we're doin' this, Rarity. I've been puttin' work before our spa time for too long. I know we've only got an hour, but I can't wait to have a steam.
61000d A steam is just the start. I know exactly what we'll do, and an hour will be perfect.
610003 Okay, Spike, ready with that list?
610005 Ready.
610003 Let's do this!
610005 [reading] "Step one - open the gate."
610000 [gate creaks]
610000 [pigs oinking]
610005 Okay. [reading] "Step two - close the gate."
610003 Huh?
610005 Mm. That's what it says.
610000 [gate creaks]
610005 [reading] "Step three - walk away."
610003 "Walk away"? Really?
610005 [intonation of "I don't know"] Mmm.
610008 I just hope Twilight and Spike can handle things until I get back.
61000d Now, Applejack, if we are really to enjoy this time together, you simply must give yourself over to the idea that you are off-duty and try to relax.
610008 I know. You're right. I really am glad we're doin' this. And as long as it's only an hour, I'm sure everythin' will be just fine.
61000d Exactly. Now kindly step this way. Relaxation awaits.
610000 [door opens]
610000 [door closes]
61000d [gasps] Rainbow Dash! What are you doing here?!
610043 [giggle]
610008 Yeah. I didn't think spa treatments were your thing exactly.
61000c What?!
610000 [robe and slippers thud]
61000c Oh, they're totally not. At least, not the froufrou kind.
61000d Ah.
610008 Huh.
61000c Yeah, I, uh, I think I tweaked something at Wonderbolts practice the other day. I just came in for a deep tissue sports massage.
610341 Ah, Miss Dash, I am so sorry, but we are running just a tad behind, and we are not quite ready to start your pampered muscle massage and indulgent hooficure just yet.
61000c Oh! [chuckles nervously] I-I'm pretty sure that wasn't what I signed up for.
610341 But they are your usual.
61000c And it seems like you're really busy today anyway! I'll just come back tomorrow. [to Rarity and Applejack] Uh, see you two later! Have fun! [to Lavender Essence, whispered] But put me down for the same thing.
610000 [whoosh]
610008 [chuckles] Too bad Rainbow Dash just hates those "froufrou" spa treatments. She could have joined us for a nice steam. Hoo-wee! I can't wait.
61000d [laughs] Indeed. Although, if they couldn't fit Dashie in, I wonder just how far behind things are running. Obviously, we're on a very tight schedule.
610000 [thud]
61000d [grunts, gasps] Well, maybe not everypony is waiting for the steam room.
610059 Oh, no. No, that's exactly what we're waiting for. Oh, I hope you're not in a hurry.
610008 So everypony here wants a steam bath?
610000 [ponies confirming]
61000d Well, the solution is obvious. We'll simply have to start our short time at the spa with something else.
610008 [scoffs] Nothin' doin'. I came here to have a steam, and that's just what I'm gonna get!
61000d But, but, it'll take most of our hour just to get through this line!
610282 RRRRarity! My favorite customer! Mwah! Mwah! And Appleyack? Well, it certainly has been a long time since you two were here together! So lovely to have you back.
61000d Well, I wish I could say the same.
610282 Yes, the wait time for the steam room certainly has been getting worse lately. But I'm sure we'll be able to accommodate your usual treatments.
610008 Not without my steam!
61000d Apparently, Applejack won't consider starting her time at the spa without a steam, and we only have an hour.
610282 That is a problem.
61000d Applejack, where are you going?
610000 [ponies scoff and groan]
610008 Um, why are y'all just standin' here?
610342 Ugh! Just waiting for the steam to build up.
6102ed Without steam, a steam room's just a room, and I've got plenty of those at home. Because I live in a mansion.
610000 [clink, gauge hisses, needle creaks]
610282 It has been taking longer for the steam to reach the Ponyville Day Spa quality. We even had to add a warm towel service. So sorry for the delay, everypony. Please help yourselves.
610008 So if you're not gettin' enough steam, that must mean there's not enough hot water.
61000d Ooh, Applejack, honestly, can't we just start with a hooficure? We're going to run out of time.
610008 Hmm.
610000 [door opens]
610000 [loud whirring in distance]
610008 Ha! Now what do we have here?
61000d The laundry room, of course. And at this point, I'm considering soaking my hooves in one of the machines so my time here isn't a total loss!
610282 The Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on sanitary conditions, and fresh linens are integral part.
610008 Well, sure, but have you always run every single one of these here machines full bore all day, every day?
610343 The answer is no. But ponies sure do love the warm towel service.
610008 Hmmm.
610343 Eh, you are all wanting towel?
610008 Looks to me like you don't have any left.
610343 Well, like I said, warm towels are big hit.
610000 [hissing]
610008 I think I figured out the problem. You've got a small leak, and that means the steam takes just a little longer to build up. And while ponies wait, they get cold. Cold ponies start wrappin' themselves in towels, and all those dirty towels have to be cleaned because Ponyville Day Spa prides itself on cleanliness.
610343 Eh, what?
610008 Basically, losin' steam makes you use more towels. That means you do more laundry, which uses up the hot water you need to make more steam, so the problem just keeps gettin' worse.
61000f [talk at the same time]
610282 Ah! I had no idea.
61000d Wonderful. Now that we've solved the great steam mystery, we can finally get back to our... significantly less than an hour of relaxation.
610008 Rarity, are you kiddin'? I can't just leave things like this. I'm gonna need my tools.
61000d [scoffs]
610000 [surf rock music]
610000 [clank]
61000d Ahh!
610008 Whew! Now that that leak's fixed, ponies won't get so cold they use up all those towels! And without all that laundry, there'll be plenty of hot water for all the steam anypony could want!
610343 And I only have to be doing vash once a day!
610000 [door closes]
610282 Wow, Appleyack! Have you ever considered a career in the spa industry? I'm sure I can find something for you.
610008 [laughs] No, thanks. I'm just relieved I can finally relax in the steam. What do you say, Rarity?
61000d It sounds lovely, Applejack, but... unfortunately, you spent so much time fixing the steam room, we don't have any time left to use it. Honestly, how in Equestria did it never occur to you to check for leaks?
610282 There's just so many other things to worry about! I suppose ve get used to the way things are, and ve don't realize there vas problem.
61000d You obviously need an outside eye to evaluate the situation. It's lucky for you Applejack is too stubborn to relax!
610008 Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity. We'll just have to do this another day. Twilight and Spike should be done feedin' the pigs by now.
61000d Twilight is a very capable pony. I'm sure she can figure out what to do next.
610008 Look, I know Twilight's a princess and an Alicorn, but she isn't a farmer. I've been doin' farm work my whole life, and I'm not sure it's somethin' you can just "figure out".
61000d Of course. [gasps] Why don't we pop back so you could explain to Twilight what to do next, and then we'll come back here and pick up where we left off?
610008 Well, I suppose I could try... assumin' everythin' went well so far.
61000d [laughing] Oh, Applejack, honestly! How could it not?
610005 Wouldn't it be easier to just fly?
610003 I told you, Spike. We're following Applejack's list to the letter, and Applejack doesn't fly! [straining] [yelps]
610005 [yelps]
610003 [groans]
610008 I'm sorry, Rarity, but I think I'm gonna have to finish these chores myself.
61000d [grumbles]
61000d Twilight, darling! How in the world did you end up there?
610003 Spike and I were just trying to follow Applejack's list as closely as possible.
610005 Mmmh... Maybe not the best plan.
610003 I'm sorry, Applejack, but we never even got started feeding the pigs.
610000 [pigs snorting]
610008 That's alright, Twilight. I know you did your best. I guess a list can't really capture all the ways I have of doin' things.
610003 At least you two got to spend some time at the spa together.
610005 Yeah, that must've been super relaxing!
61000d Well, if watching Applejack fix plumbing counts as relaxing, then yes.
610003 What about your hour of spa perfection?
61000d As it turns out, the Ponyville Day Spa had a few problems with their steam room, and somepony refused to relax until she had fixed them.
610008 I'm sorry, but I just couldn't let those spa ponies go another minute puttin' up with problems they didn't even know they had! Somehow they just got used to a huge bottleneck of ponies standin' around waitin'. An' I took one good look at that spa jam, and I knew I had to do somethin'! Sometimes the simplest things can just derail a whole operation. [babbles] Whether it's a leaky pipe or doin' too much laundry. You can't just stick to the same old way of doin' things and expect them to get better. [clucking] I mean, thinkin' you can is just plumb ridiculous. Right? [short laugh] It's funny when you realize the extra work they were doin' was actually makin' things worse!
610000 [pigs squeal]
610000 [pigs stampeding]
610008 I mean, I guess it's possible to get stuck in a routine where you're doin' all this extra stuff and not realize it, but I can't for the life of me think of how! [beat] Why are y'all starin' at me like that?
610000 [beat]
61000d Um... Are you certain everything you just did is entirely necessary to feed the pigs?
610008 What? Of course! Why would I be doin' it if it weren't? See, this gate here used to squeak so loud, the pigs would run to the other side of the pen and never come out! So I open and close it to let them know it's safe.
610003 But it doesn't squeak anymore.
610008 Of course not! I fixed that ages ago. Then I realized puttin' a little fright into 'em got 'em all hustlin' out of the pen.
610005 They don't look scared to me.
610008 Well, no. They got used to it. Which is why I started doin' the chicken dance! To show 'em that if they didn't get to eatin' their food, the chickens would. 'Course, bein' a chicken, I couldn't very well open the gate. Gettin' the food bucket to spill into the trough was just a happy accident because one time I left it there by mistake.
610003 Uh, Applejack? It seems like everything you're doing is to fix things that aren't really problems anymore.
610008 Well, I'll be...
61000d Hmmm... Maybe it isn't so hard to get stuck doing extra work after all.
610008 Huh. I wonder if I've been doin' that around here with anythin' else.
61000d Well, there's only one way to find out!
610000 [surf rock music]
610000 [chickens squawking]
610000 [valves squeaking, water sprinkling, repeating]
610000 [chicken wire rattling]
610000 [scissors snipping]
610008 [sighs] Thanks, y'all. I guess I just got so used to doin' everythin' a certain way, I didn't realize there were any problems.
610003 Having a friend look at what you're doing with an outside eye can really help!
61000d Mm-hmm! And I suppose if it weren't for our unsuccessful time at the spa, none of us would've realized it.
610003 Well, now that your chores are streamlined, what are you gonna do with all the extra time?
610008 I think I have a few ideas.
610000 [door opens]
610008 [sighs] Think you can come up with enough things for us to do now that we have more time to relax?
61000d Oh, please. I could plan a week's worth of treatments!
610008 Heh. Well, let's just start with the rest of the day for now. After all the work we just did on the farm, I am ready for some serious relaxation!
61000c [sighs] Thanks for letting me know there was an opening. I don't know if I could make it without my pampered muscle massage.
610282 Don't vorry about it. Shall I put you down for another one tomorrow?
61000c Oh, absolutely! Sometimes a girl just has to pamper herself, am I right?
61000d You certainly are!
61000c [gasps] [stammering] Oh! Hey! I was just, uh, uh...
610008 Gettin' a "sports" pamperin'? [giggles]
61000d [giggles] Don't worry, Rainbow Dash. We were just heading in for some pampering ourselves. You could always join us.
610008 That is, if you don't mind sufferin' through one or two "froufrou" treatments.
61000c Uh... I suppose I could take it. You know, for you ponies.
61003e [laughing]
610000 [credits]
611344 We're so happy you could come have lunch with your father and me, Fluttershy.
61100e I'm so glad you asked.
61100c And it was super awesome of you to invite me too! Things have been so busy with the Wonderbolts lately, it's great to get a chance to relax someplace quiet.
611345 That's exactly what I intend to do now that I've retired. In fact, I converted the back house to showcase my cloud collection. I have my clouds, your mom has her flowers, you've got your animals, and your brother...
611344 Zephyr Breeze has his... interests. [nervous laugh]
61100c I'll say! Remember when he was convinced square clouds were gonna be the next big thing? [laughs]
611344 He's matured a lot since then.
611345 Actually, it's funny you bring Zephyr up...
611000 [beat]
61100e Oh, no! Not again!
611344 It's just for a little while, dear. 'Til he gets back on his hooves.
61100c Wait, you don't mean—!
611000 [door opens]
611346 Guess who's home! That's right, big sis, it's your one and only favorite little brother, moi.
61100e [groans]
611000 [theme song]
611000 [splat]
611346 Hi, Flutterbutter! How's the bestest big sister ever? Hey, where's the love? How about a little excitement to see your baby brother?
61100e I'm just surprised. When you left, you said mane therapy was your calling.
611346 Oh, it is, sis, it is. You would not believe how much stress ponies hold in their manes. Everything gets limp and unmanageable. No offense, but brushing alone won't solve the problem.
61100e What went wrong?
611346 Nothing went wrong, per se. It's just the powers that be were so locked into their required styles, and you know me. I've got my own style! And I think they were a little threatened.
611344 O-Oh, this is... lovely, dear.
61100c Ugh.
611346 Welllll, if it ain't Rainbows "The Best Flyer There Ever Was" Dash!
61100c [flatly] Oh, this ought to be good.
611346 Sorry, I shouldn't tease you. I know the whole super awesome flyer bit's just to impress me.
61100c [surprised neigh]
611346 Still, thanks for showing up for my homecoming. It's, it's sweet.
61100c [strangled gasp]
611346 I kinda thought there'd be more ponies here. I mean, what about your party planner friend, um... Sprinkle Pie! She could've turned this into a real house partay, am I right? I mean, this place could use it. [singsong] Drab!
611344 Heh. I-I, eh...
611345 We have been meaning to redecorate...
611346 Dad, please. When I get all my stuff back in here, you won't even remember what this boring old place looked like!
611000 [scraping]
61100e [whispering] Um, Mom, Dad, can I talk to you for a second?
611344 [sighs] What is it, honey?
61100e I'm not so sure letting Zephyr move back home is a good idea. I know you both want to help, but don't you remember last time?
611344 Zephyr's just trying to find his place, dear.
61100e [sighs] I know. It just seems like his place always ends up being your place. And then he sort of makes you do everything for him!
611345 Well, we may not be as bold as you, Fluttershy, but don't you worry. We know how to stand up for ourselves.
611346 And they were all like, "We love your free spirit, Zeph! And it would be wrong to cage that! Go follow your dreams!"
611000 [thump]
61100c Zeph was just telling me all about the ins and outs of mane therapy school.
611346 It's all so political. I just could not take it!
61100e Well, maybe if you stuck with it for more than a few weeks...
611346 Sorry, sis, but when something's not the right fit, this pony's gotta fly!
611000 [clunk]
611346 [yawns] Anyway, good talk, Rainbows. I am so touched you came to see me, really. I hate to deprive you of my presence, but this breeze needs his Z's.
61100c You know it's the middle of the day, right?
611346 I know. [maracas in background] Siesta! I'm just gonna assume you made up my room the way I like it, right, Mom? Oh, I almost forgot! All my stuff is out front. Wanna grab that for me, Pops? [short laugh] Thanks.
61100c [sighs] Same old Zeph.
61100c I know you weren't expecting to see your brother, but you've been kind of quiet, even for you.
61100e I'm sorry, but I am just so... so... peeved right now! [gasps] Excuse my language!
611007 Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!
611008 [whistles]
611000 [thump]
61100e Oh, um, sorry about that.
61100c We just had lunch with Fluttershy's parents, and you'll never guess who showed up.
611007 Ooh! Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle Donkey? Cheese Sandwich? Ms. Harshwhinny?!
61100c Zephyr Breeze.
611007 Oh, that makes more sense.
611008 And from the look on your face, I'm guessin' it's for another one of his "extended stays"?
61100c She's a bit peeved.
61100e Zephyr's my brother, and I love him. But he's never learned to do anything for himself. I don't know why my parents keep letting him trot all over them!
611008 Well, if your parents won't stand up for themselves, maybe you need to stand up for them.
61100e You know, you're right!
61100e [inhales and exhales]
611000 [smash!]
61100e [gasps]
611000 [smash!, thunder rumbling]
61100e Zephyr Breeze!
611346 Oh, hey, sis. Come to see me work my magic and turn this place from drab to fab, huh? Well, watch and learn!
61100e Can't you see what you're doing?!
611346 Yeah! I'm getting rid of this old stuff so I can turn the backhouse into my art studio! I've decided I'm gonna be a sculptor!
61100e I'm talking about Mom's flowers!
611346 She's gonna move them so I can have my meditation patio here. She loves replanting stuff. Don't you, Mom?
61100e And Dad's been collecting his favorite bits of cloud from the factory since before you were born.
611345 The very best from every production run since my first day on the job. Ah!
611000 [glass shatters]
611345 [sighs] But why hold onto the past really?
61100e You can't just fly in and change everything Mom and Dad have built here.
611346 But this is the only place big enough for my studio/meditation garden. Ooh! Unless I do it in the living room!
61100e [to her parents] I know speaking up for yourself can be hard, believe me, but Zephyr will never stand on his own if he can lean on you.
611346 Don't be so dramatic, sis! Mom and Dad just wanna let me be me! Right? I can do plenty on my own.
61100e I agree. Which is why you should move out.
611346 Oh. Well... I mean, I-I totally would, but... I don't think that's what Mom and Dad want! It's not, is it?
611344 Ehhh...
611345 You know we love you, son, but your sister has a point.
611346 [tearing up] Sure. I mean, I really just came back here to keep you guys company, but... whatever's best for the family. I just... I just gotta grab a few essentials.
611344 And... y-you definitely have somewhere else to go?
611346 Of course! There's plenty of ponies who'd love for a little breeze to blow their way...
61100c So... where's Zeph gonna go now?
61100e I'm not sure. Oh, I hope I did the right thing...
61100c Are you kidding? One hundred percent!
611346 [singsong] Hey, sis!
611000 [door opens]
611346 Your new roomie's here!
61100c Okay, maybe like seventy percent.
61100e Um, Zephyr. When Mom and Dad told you to find someplace else to live, I don't think they meant here.
611346 Well, it's not their house, so by definition, it's someplace else. Am I right, Rainbows? Stop oogling me and help settle this.
61100c [sighs] You know what? I totally forgot that I promised to help Pinkie Pie... sprinkle... something.
611000 [zoom]
61100e You said you had plenty of places to go!
611346 Ehhhh...
61100e [sighs] Fine. You can stay here—
611346 You're the best! We're gonna have so much fun.
61100e On one condition.
611346 Totally. Anything.
61100e You have to get a job.
611346 Cracking the whip, huh? You always were kind of bossy.
61100e [through gritted teeth] Zephyr Breeze...
611346 Kidding! Get a job. Absolutely.
611000 [scraping]
611000 [rooster crows]
611346 [yawns] Where are we goin' so early? You have no idea how bad morning sun is for your mane.
61100e Remember how we talked about you getting a job?
611346 It was just yesterday, and it's totally on my to-do list, but you can't expect to find something befitting my awesomeness overnight.
61100e I thought you might say that.
611000 [knocking]
611000 [door opens]
61100e So I did it for you.
611346 What?!
61100d These fabrics all need to be dyed those colors. Do you think you can handle that?
611346 [muttering] Um, I don't know...
61100d You get started while Fluttershy and I head to the store for more supplies. Ta-ta!
61100e Good luck!
611000 [door closes]
611000 [splats]
61100e Thanks for giving my brother a job. I just hope he's up to the task.
61100d Oh, darling, dyeing fabric is the simplest thing!
611000 [door opens]
61100d You just dip cloth in a bo—
61107e [gasps]
611346 [humming to himself] Rarity, you're back!
61100e What did you do?
611346 Since you talk to animals all the time, I just figured it runs in the family, so why not outsource this stuff, you know?
611000 [animals chittering]
611346 Turns out the animal communication thing isn't genetic.
61100d Zephyr, I asked you to do this job! Not to pawn it off on innocent woodland creatures!
611346 Okay, I guess you have some feelings about this. But you should know it's basically your cat's fault for walking by and giving me the idea. But I'm actually kinda into this look!
61106a [yowls]
611346 So I guess what I'm saying is... you're welcome?
61100d [frustrated stuttering] Zephyr, this is just unacceptable!
611346 Wow. I guess I know when my efforts aren't appreciated.
61100d Ugghh!
611000 [door closes]
61100e [giggles nervously]
611346 Whoa! Those are tall!
611003 I'm glad you noticed, because they're your new job.
611346 Wha? [to Fluttershy] You said you were taking me to tea with the princess!
61100e Actually, I said I was going to tea with the princess. You're going to work.
611346 Sis, c'mon!
611003 Don't worry, Zephyr, it'll be easy. I just need a Pegasus pony to fly up and wipe each window down from top to bottom.
611005 And I'm here to make sure you do it right.
611000 [door opens]
611003 Wow, Zephyr! This looks amazing!
611000 [ukulele strumming]
611346 Uh, you know, like you said, it was easy!
61100e Where's Spike?
611005 Up here!
611003 You were supposed to supervise, not do all the work!
611005 I was supervising! And then Zephyr asked me about different cleaning techniques and which one was best, and if I could— Hey! I did all the work!
611346 Don't let him fool you. Old Spike is quite the taskmaster.
611000 [zip]
611346 Oh, come on, sis. I had to ask Spike to make sure I was doing it right.
61100e You didn't do it at all! [inhales] Well, I guarantee there won't be any fooling around on the next job.
611346 Next job?
611000 [whoosh]
61100c That's right, Zeph! You're coming with me!
611346 You don't have to come up with some excuse to hang out with me, Rainbows! Let's just go for a fly and see where the day takes us.
61100c [frustrated sigh] We're going to Wonderbolts Headquarters. And I am gonna give you a job so simple and straightforward, not even you can weasel your way out of it! [quickly] And the second you try, I'm gonna zap you with a storm cloud! Got it?!
611346 Oh, I got it. I can already feel the electricity between us.
611000 [door opens]
611346 Rainbow Dash is crazy, okay?! She expects me to do stuff right when she asks me to do it! It's insane!
61100e So you just quit? Again?
611346 Escaped is more like it. Besides, what was I supposed to do?
61100e Keep trying? Finish something for once? Maybe that way, you'd actually find something you like to do!
611346 That all sounds fine for your friends, but it's just not me.
61100e Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I don't think you can live here.
611346 Fine! I'll just go live in the woods like my foreponies before me! Guess the only breeze this zephyr can count on is his own!
611000 [sweeping]
61100c Aw, cheer up, Fluttershy. I know it was hard, but you did the right thing. You couldn't let Zephyr pull the same stuff on you that he's always pulled on your folks!
61100e I guess so...
61125f [twittering]
61100e Oh, hello, Constance!
61125f [twittering]
61100e Oh? Oh, dear.
611346 See, Wigford? The Breeze needs nopony! We've got food, shelter. Just need to put the old kettle on...
611000 [rocks clinking]
611000 [beat]
611346 Come on, sticky-sticky, make with the sparks!
611000 [clanging]
611346 Ugh! What's a pony got to do to find a decent stick around here?!
611000 [whap]
611346 Ugh. [grunting]
61100c I know he needs to learn to do things for himself, but...
61100e Oh... I can't let him live like this.
611000 [crunch]
61100c Actually, I don't think he'd make it through the night.
611000 [tapping]
611000 [leaves rustling]
611346 [gasps] Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um, cozying up in my sleeping bag! Ready to call it an early night! [mock-tired] Such an exhausting day, y'know?
61100c It's noon.
611346 You know me! [maracas in background] Siesta...
611000 [thunk]
611346 Ugh... I can't do this. I can't do anything.
61100e Zephyr, you're smart and talented. You could do anything if you just tried!
611346 And what if I give everything I have and still fail? Honestly, I think it's better not to try at all.
61100c But then you won't ever do anything.
611346 I don't expect you two to understand. I mean, when have you ever failed? You've literally helped save Equestria, like, a dozen times.
61100e And I was worried that I'd fail every time! Sometimes you have to do things, even though you might fail.
611346 But failing is the worst!
61100e And quitting doesn't feel much better, does it?
611346 No.
61100e So here's the deal - You can come back with me, but you have to do exactly what I say. No exceptions.
611346 [resigned] I will literally do anything you ask me if it means I don't have to stay here.
61100e Okay, you know what you have to do, right?
611346 Beg for help, then quit when I get frustrated. Just kidding! Total opposite of that. Got it.
611000 [door opens]
61100c You think he can do it?
61100e [Fluttershy]
61100e Everypony has times in their lives
61100e When their hearts are filled with doubt
611346 [Zephyr Breeze]
611346 Frustration builds up inside
611346 And it makes you want to shout
61100c [Rainbow Dash]
61100c But if you just take that first step
61100c The next one will appear
611000 [Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
611000 And you find you can walk, then run
611000 Then fly...!
611000 Into the stratosphere
611000 You've got to give it your best
611000 So you can pass the test
611000 Give it everything that you've got
611000 And we know you can win
611000 You just have to begin
611000 Have to give it your very best shot
611346 [Zephyr Breeze]
611346 There are times when you want to give up
611346 When you think that you can't go on
611000 [Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
611000 But if you fight through with all of your might
611000 You will find that you can't go wrong
611000 That you could do it all along
61100e [Fluttershy]
61100e Everypony has times in their lives
61100e When their hearts are filled with doubt
61100c [Rainbow Dash]
61100c But if you just give it your all
61100c You'll start to work it out
611346 [Zephyr Breeze]
611346 And I know I can't give up too soon
611346 Get myself in the zone
611346 And I find I can walk, then run
611000 [Fluttershy, Zephyr, and Rainbow Dash]
611000 Then fly...!
611346 [Zephyr Breeze]
611346 I can do it on my own
611000 [Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash]
611000 You can do it on your own
611346 [Zephyr Breeze]
611346 I can do it on my own
611346 I can do it on my own
611346 I did it! I actually finished something! By myself!
61100c And it looks exactly like it's supposed to.
61100e I knew you could do it, Zephyr.
611346 I didn't! But I do now. Thanks for believing in me, sis.
61100e That's what big sisters are for.
61100c So, Zeph, now that you've accomplished this, what's next?
611346 Anything I want! I mean, the sky's the limit, right?
611000 [beat]
611346 But, y'know... I've got some baby steps in mind.
61100c Thanks for dinner, Mr and Mrs Shy! Ha! It was great as usual.
611344 Thank you, dear, for not giving up on Zephyr. After all these years of pining for him, it must be so satisfying to see him on the right track.
61100c Huh...?
61100e Have you heard from Zephyr? Is he doing well?
611345 I tell you, he's a brand new pony! So full of drive and determination.
61100c Heh. That's great.
611000 [door opens]
611346 [singsong] Guess who graduated from mane therapy training?
61100c Hah, awesome!
611345 Congratulations, son!
611344 You look so handsome!
61100e I'm so proud of you, Zephyr.
611346 It was only a matter of time before they recognized my true genius! But actually doing the work probably helped, and I wouldn't have if it weren't for you.
61100e Oh, I just gave you some encouragement. You did this on your own.
611346 And honestly, right now I feel like I can do anything... except find a place. I can still crash here for a few days, right?
611000 [credits]
612003 As you've all probably noticed, it's been quite some time since the map has sent us on a mission of friendship.
612005 Yeah! Ever since Starlight messed with it to go back in time and try to change history!
612003 Yes. Since then. But, as part of her studies, Starlight's been assisting me. And together, we think we've come up with a spell that can get it working again!
612000 [ponies cheering]
612007 [simultaneously] Ooh, well done!
612003 Now without further ado...
612000 [magic sounds]
612000 [ponies gasping and oohing]
612007 Fluttershy and Twilight in Appleloosa! No, me and Rainbow Dash in Las Pegasus! No, Rainbow Dash and Twilight in Yakyakistan! No, Twilight and Twilight in Twilight's castle! Oh. Me! Me! Oh, me... and Rarity! Ooh! I hope it's some faraway place that nopony has gone before!
61200d [chuckles nervously] Well, maybe not too far away. An adventure somewhere that has modern conveniences would be preferable. [gasps] Canterlot! This is wonderful! I can check the boutique! Perhaps there'll be some social events that we can attend! [gasps] I'll have to pack extra outfits! What will I wear?!
612007 Y'know, some ponies get excited about the silliest things.
612000 [theme song]
61200d [sighs] Now then, as far as finding a friendship problem, I suggest we start at the castle and begin to question the proper—
612007 Oh, Rarity, you don't find a friendship problem. It finds you. We just need to go with the flow, and eventually, kablam! We get friendship problem'd right between the eyes.
61200d Well, this is a team effort, so if you feel we should go with the flow, then with the flow we shall go. But where's the flow saying we should go?
612007 You know Canterlot. What do you think we should do?
61200d Hm. Take your pick. Culture, couture, cuisine!
612000 [stomach rumbling]
61200d Oh, my. Well, it sounds like your stomach is saying we should flow towards some lunch? I know just where to go.
61200d Restaurant Row, the absolute best place for fine dining in all of Equestria!
612007 Ooh, so many choices! Where should we go? This one? That one? Those ones?
61200d Any establishments that have this – the three-hoof rating.
612007 Um, whose hooves?
61200d Why, Zesty Gourmand, the Queen of Cuisine. When it comes to food, she is the ultimate authority in Canterlot and thus all Equestria. She judges a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation. Without her approval, a restaurant simply cannot survive.
612007 What's so important about her approval?
61200d Zesty grew up around fine dining, and everypony hangs on her every word when it comes to cuisine.
612007 Wow! Then the food here must be amazing! Lead the way, partner! Whee! [giggles]
61200d [gasps] Oh, my! Such presentation. Mm. Oh. [smacks lips] Ah. Yes. Very nice...
612000 [ploink!]
612007 Nom nom nom. [gulps, gags] Maybe, I'm not in the mood for... [whispers] whatever this is. Can we try someplace else?
612007 Nom nom. Ugh. Maybe one more stop?
612007 Blech! Nope.
612007 Maybe instead of trusting somepony else's hooves, I should pick the next place?
61200d Ugh! Very well.
612007 [sniffing, gasps]
61200d The Tasty Treat. It's very... rustic. [whispers] It looks like it hasn't even been rated.
612007 Thank goodness! Hee-hee!
612000 [door closes]
612000 [Middle Eastern music plays]
61200d Are we sure they're open?
612007 [sniffs deeply] Mmmm. It smells open.
612000 [clattering]
612347 Oh! Are you here for lunch?
612007 Yes, indeedy!
612347 I'm Saffron Masala, the chef here at The Tasty Treat, the most exotic cuisine in Canterlot. Would you like to hear about the specials?
61200d We're actually in a bit of a hur—
612007 Yes, please!
612347 We have a curried oat cake.
612007 We'll take one!
612347 Uh, and a grass sandwich that has been marinated overnight in a mustard Dijon dressing.
612007 How can you say no to that?
612347 A-And for you?
61200d Oh, me? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you. [aside, singsong, to Pinkie] No rating.
612007 [sighs]
612348 [sighs, grumbling in Hindi]
612007 Hiya! What's your name?
612348 Coriander Cumin.
612007 Are you a chef here too?
612348 My daughter cooks. I host.
612007 Then why are you stacking chairs?
612348 Without customers, I have nopony to host for. So I stack!
612347 Father, stop it! Don't close up the restaurant around our guests.
612348 What does it matter?! When they leave, nopony else will be coming in!
612347 Well, your attitude isn't going to bring anyone in! Can't you at least pretend to be positive?!
612007 [slurps] So good!
612348 You are doing enough pretending for the both of us. Nopony here wants to try anything new! I know when to throw in the towel!
61200d Um, Pinkie, perhaps we should excuse ourselves.
612007 [muffled speaking] Oh, Rarity, try this!
61200d [munches] Ooh!
612347 Maybe if you would listen to my ideas for once...
612348 Oh, yes! I did not move halfway across Equestria for my daughter that I never listen to!
612007 [spits] Rarity, I think that friendship problem just kablammed us right between the eyes!
61200d These two? Oh, I don't know, darling. The food is excellent, but I'm not sure there's much you and I can do to help them.
612348 [scoffs] What would you have me do? We can't even get Zesty Gourmand to come to our restaurant. She took one look at how empty it was and said it wasn't even worth rating!
61200d That's it!
612007 Yes! Uh, what's it?
61200d The flow has led us here! This is our mission! [to Saffron and Coriander] We are going to get you a three-hoof rating and save your restaurant! I can get Zesty Gourmand here!
612007 [gasps] And I can pack this place with ponies!
612348 Hmph. And how do you intend to do such a thing?
61201e Just leave it to us!
612347 Father, will you please stop packing things?!
612348 When the lovely pony comes back and says she couldn't convince Zesty Gourmand to come visit us, we will need to pack all this up. I am just getting a head start.
612007 You really don't know Rarity.
61200d [singsong] I've done it!
612007 See?
61200d It took all of my charm and cajoling, but I was able to convince Zesty Gourmand to come and try the food!
612348 What is the catch?
61200d Ah, yes. Well, um, there is a bit of a challenge. The only time she could make herself available is tonight.
612348 Pfft. Oh, yeah, right.
612347 What is it?
61200d Zesty rates a restaurant on cuisine, decor, and presentation, and she has very specific tastes. If she's coming tonight, there is quite a bit of work that needs to get done.
612007 Like what?
61200d Oh, a tweak here, a tuck there, some slight modifications to the menu. [laughs nervously] We just need the place to feel more cosmopolitan.
612348 Pfft.
612347 Father, after Rarity went to all of this trouble for us, can't we at least try?
61200d Why don't I stay behind with Coriander to get the restaurant ready for Zesty's arrival? You and Saffron can try and drum up some business.
612007 One packed restaurant, coming right up!
61200d Coriander, I understand your trepidation. But I promise you, we will get those hooves by making this place feel just like all of the other restaurants on Restaurant Row!
612000 [door shuts]
612347 [sighs] I hope my father doesn't drive Rarity crazy.
612007 It'll be fine. Rarity's gonna make sure that The Tasty Treat is the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not like all of those stuffy places on Restaurant Row.
61200d [Rarity]
61200d Here's what I know -
61200d If you want to succeed
61200d You must follow the trends, that's the key
61200d If you want to show
61200d That you've got what it takes
61200d You must be what they want you to be
612007 [Pinkie Pie]
612007 Here's what I know -
612007 Your food is so good
612007 The flavor's so fancy and free
612007 You just need to show
612007 That unique sense of taste
612007 Go on, be yourself, let them see
612000 [Pinkie Pie and Rarity]
612000 It's gonna work
612000 I know it's gonna work
612000 It's gonna work out just fine, trust me
612000 It's gonna work
612000 I swear it's gonna work
612000 It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see!
61200d [Rarity]
61200d You need to change
61200d If you want to compete
61200d But fear not, for I know what to do
61200d I know it feels strange
61200d But trust me, when we're done
61200d We'll make sure that you're a hit, too
612007 [Pinkie Pie]
612007 Don't ever change
612007 Being different is good
612007 Don't let what others do be your cue
612007 Never rearrange
612007 'Cause somepony said you should
612007 Just trust your heart, it will know what to do
612000 [Pinkie Pie and Rarity]
612000 It's gonna work
612000 I know it's gonna work
612000 It's gonna work out just fine, trust me
612000 It's gonna work
612000 I swear it's gonna work
612000 It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see!
612007 [Pinkie Pie]
612007 Be unique
61200d [Rarity]
61200d Just be the same
612007 [Pinkie Pie]
612007 Trust your heart
61200d [Rarity]
61200d You'll make your name
612000 [Pinkie Pie and Rarity]
612000 We'll help you every step of the way
612000 Because we know what you need to do
612000 And you should know it too
612000 It's gonna work
612000 I know it's gonna work
612000 It's gonna work out just fine, trust me
612000 It's gonna work
612000 I swear it's gonna work
612000 It's gonna work out just fine, you'll see!
612347 [gasps] The day is almost over, and we haven't found any ponies! What will we do?
612007 Try harder! Fillies and gentlecolts! Check out the super stupendous and amazing cuisine of The Tasty Treat! Grand re-opening tonight!
6122cd How many hooves does it have?
612347 No hooves yet, but hopefully soon!
6122c8 Well, when it gets rated, let us know.
612007 Rrrgh! Stupid hooves!
612000 [paper flapping]
612000 [thunk]
612349 Oh, look at this, hun!
61234a Oh, The Tasty Treat! Do you think that's a restaurant, sugar?
612007 Yes! Yes, it is!
612349 We came to Canterlot from Whinnyapolis to be adventurous. But so far, the food in all these hoity-toity places tastes like somepony cooked up nothin' with a side o' nothin'.
612347 Well, please, come try the Tasty Treat. I think it's going to be exactly what you're looking for.
612000 [spraying]
61200d [sighs] This is going to be exactly what Zesty is looking for!
612000 [door opens]
612347 Father, we're ba— [gasps]
612007 Rarity, what did you do?
612348 [unenthusiastic] Welcome to The Tasty Treat. You can eat here if you want. Or not. Who cares?
61200d I know. Isn't it perfect? Zesty is sure to love it.
612007 I thought we were trying to make this the most unique and beautiful restaurant in Canterlot! Not make it exactly like every other restaurant!
61200d [short laugh] We want to help our friends by getting them three hooves. That will only happen if this is like every other restaurant.
612347 Father, what is this?!
612007 Not that! Anything but that!
612348 This is what we must cook if we want to succeed here!
612347 This isn't what I wanted! I wanted Canterlot to like us for us!
612007 Rarity, how could you ruin the restaurant?!
61200d Oh, pff. Kch. Ts! We helped save the restaurant. Now, where are the other guests? How many other ponies are coming?
61234b Two.
61200d Just two?! I thought you said you could pack the place with ponies no matter what!
612007 You said you would make the restaurant better...
61200d [gasps]
612007 ...so I guess we both didn't know what we were talking about!
612000 [knocking]
61200d [gasps] Zesty Gourmand! Everypony, places!
612000 [door opens]
61200d [gulps]
612348 [unenthusiastic] Welcome to The Tasty Treat. What can I get you this evening?
61234c I hardly think it matters, but by all means, try your best to impress.
61234a Well, we'll both try the special this evening. Maybe with a little kick to it, eh? Yeah, we've been craving some food with actual taste.
612348 Saffron Masala, what are you doing?!
612347 I'm trying to save our reputations! [sips] I've given it at least a little bit of flavor.
61200d No-no-n-n-no, but that's not what Zesty wants!
612007 What kind of food expert doesn't want flavor?! That's insane!
612000 [pouring]
612007 I'm taking this out there!
61200d No! Zesty will hate it! You are going to ruin this for them!
612007 No, I'm trying to fix it after you ruined it!
612000 [thunk]
61201e Noooooo!
612000 [splat]
61234c I think we are done here.
61200d Zesty! Please wait! Allow me to explain!
61234c Rarity, when it comes to fashion, you are adequate. But take some advice from a friend – keep your opinions out of restaurants. Substandard food, laughable service, and I would think even you could recognize that the decor here is trying desperately while desperately failing. Recommending a disreputable place such as this could do serious damage to your social standing.
612007 Disreputable?! You mean a place with food that actually tastes good?
61234c Anypony can throw ingredients together and create an obvious taste that uncultured ponies like those two can register.
612349 Hey!
61234c But it takes a true culinary artist to create a subtle taste, the barest hint of a sensation. That's what I bring to Canterlot. That's art.
612000 [door closes]
612007 I'm so embarrassed.
61200d I don't know that there are words to adequately express how truly sorry we are.
612348 The worst has happened. No use crying over spilt food now.
612347 Here. This always cheered me up when I was younger.
612348 [gasps] My spicy flat-noodle soup!
61234d [sipping]
61200d Oh, my! This is truly delightful!
612007 Mmm, this is the best thing you've made so far! And I thought the food before was the best!
612347 That's all I've ever wanted to do, father! Make food for the ponies of Canterlot like the food we made together when I was younger!
612348 It has been so long since we cooked together. Heh. Remember how you used to hide the ingredients you did not like?
61234e [laughing]
61200d You know what? Who cares what some stuffy unicorn thinks of the food here? It's exquisite.
612007 That's true.
61200d And you don't need three silly hooves in your window to prove it.
612007 That's double true!
61200d You just need ponies in here to give it a chance! Ponies that will tell everypony else in Canterlot that The Tasty Treat has the best food in the city!
612007 That's true times three!
612347 But without Zesty's approval, nopony will even try our food!
61200d Ohhhh, yes, they will. Pinkie, we are the perfect team for this! We were just doing the wrong jobs! I will go out and bring the crowd! You stay here and make sure this place is every bit as unique and rustic as it was the moment we walked in!
612348 And? What about us?
61200d You two? You are going to cook! Make whatever you want, and make a lot of it! I intend to bring a crowd!
612000 [instrumental of "It's Gonna Work" plays]
61200d Would the owner of one of the premier boutiques in Canterlot put a stamp of approval on something that wasn't fabulous?
61200d It's almost time! Is everypony ready for the grand re-re-opening?
612347 Before we open, my father and I just wanted to say... Thank you for all of your help. We've both been so stressed about the restaurant succeeding that we forgot what it was we loved about it in the first place.
612348 Cooking is something we used to love to do together. No matter what happens next, thank you for reminding us of that.
612007 Oh, you guys! Group hug!
61234f [laughing]
612007 Now come on! We've got a party to throw!
612000 [door opens]
612000 [ponies chattering]
612348 Welcome to The Tasty Treat! Make yourselves comfortable!
612000 [muffled chattering]
612347 Please, feel free to sample the food!
612000 [door opens]
61234c What's this?! What is everypony doing here?! This place has no hooves! It is not in keeping with the level of cuisine that I have set for Canterlot! Nopony told you this place was acceptable!
612350 Uh, Rarity and her friend said it was good? They told us!
61234c They told you? And who are they to tell you anything? Rarity can tell you what hats to wear with which skirts. Her friend can tell you how to maintain a tragic look for a frizzy mane. They can't tell you what food you can eat!
61200d No, we can't, and neither can you! Nopony has the right to tell these ponies what to think! Zesty, you have very... specific...
612007 And very strange!
61200d Yes, and very strange opinions about food, and that's your right. But just because you like your food a certain way, there is no reason to tell these ponies that they need to do the same!
612351 Rarity is right! I for one think the food here is delicious! I own The Smoked Oat on Restaurant Row; I hate the food we make! From now on, it's all smoked, basted, and grilled!
612352 This food is an inspiration! I own The Bake Stop. I'm going to bake my mother's bundt cake the way she made it – full of flavor!
612000 [crowd chattering and agreeing]
61200d Zesty, are you sure you wouldn't like to try the food? Ignoring a unique and fresh establishment such as this could do serious damage to your social standing.
61234c Hmph!
612000 [door slams]
612000 [beat]
612000 [crowd cheers]
612347 Thank you so much!
612348 You are both truly amazing.
612000 [cutie marks ringing]
612007 Nothing can stop the dynamic duo of Pinkie and Rarity!
612000 [crowd chattering]
612000 [credits]
613000 [rocks crunching]
61314e [gasps]
613000 [ding!]
613000 [rocks crunching]
61314e Whoa! [gasping] Oof!
613000 [ding!]
613000 [snakes hissing]
61300c Well, don't stop there! You read, I pack! That's the deal!
613003 I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash. I just keep thinking about how much fun you're gonna have at the Daring Do convention. I wish Princess Celestia didn't need my help with the friendship summit in Griffonstone.
61300c Don't worry. I'll make sure A. K. Yearling signs your book. I can't believe she's gonna be there! She never goes to conventions!
613003 [sighs]
61300c Which, I guess, will be cool for all those other fanponies. But since you and I know A. K. Yearling personally, [hushed] and we know that she's secretly Daring Do herself, [normal] it's no big deal. This convention will be fun, but it's nothing to get too excited about.
61300c So excited!
613000 [Daring Do leitmotif plays]
613000 [theme song]
613000 [general chatter]
613353 You look like a pony who'd be up for an all-inclusive one-of-a-kind adventu-cation, where you can get to live the Daring Do experience!
61300c No thanks. Did that already. Ahhh.
613000 [hissing]
61300c This is the...
613354 ...awesomest thing ever!
613355 Now this is something that only a true fan can appreciate.
61300c They even put the tiles in the right order.
613355 Huh. Good catch. Oh, I'm Quibble Pants. Nice to meet you.
61300c Rainbow Dash.
613000 [hoof-bump]
61300c Nice costume.
613355 You, too.
61300c Thanks. The hard part was figuring out the right...
613354 ...number of arrow holes.
613355 B-B-Because on page 84 of Sapphire Stone, i-it describes her dodging a, quote, "score of arrows shooting forth from holes in the very walls," unquote, but then on page 107, Daring Do says she, quote, "barely made it past the traps' barrage of arrows," unquote, but clearly, Daring Do is embellishing and the correct number of arrows is...
613354 Twenty! [chuckle]
613000 [camera clicks]
61300c [sighs] I am so glad I ran into you. Even though I knew the convention would be totally awesome, it's more fun when you're with someone who really knows Daring Do.
613355 I know what you mean. It's so hard to find a pony who really gets it.
61300c Hm. That's weird. We've only done stuff from the first trilogy. After lunch, we should probably start working our way back through the other books.
613355 Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are no other books.
61300c Of course there are. Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers, Daring Do and the Many Faces of—
613355 Uh, p-please, please don't. Just don't even mention the titles. I-I'm not saying those books don't exist. I'm saying that I refuse to acknowledge them.
61300c Why?
613355 'Cause they're horrible! I mean, there isn't a single thing after Ring of Destiny that is even remotely in the realm of the possible!
61300c What?! I know for a fact that everything in every one of those books is one hundred percent possible!
613355 Uh, and how could you possibly know that?
61300c Gyuh, uh, I just... do!
613355 Well, that's a compelling argument.
61300c Why would you even come to this convention if you hate Daring Do so much?
613355 I don't hate Daring Do. The first series was smart and cool and an amazing nod to old-time serialized adventure books, that somehow manages to be self-reflective and ironic while at the same time celebrating the art form without a hint of cynicism. Which is why I came here to ask A. K. Yearling muzzle-to-muzzle why she sold out and dumbed down the rest of her books into just a series of impossible action sequences!
61300c Okay, now I know you're crazy. A. K. Yearling is awesome, and every Daring Do book that comes out is better than the last!
613355 Wha... Wow. Okay, yeah, I-I-I'm sorry, but I could never be friends with somepony who's willing to believe impossible stuff is possible as long as Daring Do does it.
61300c That's okay, because I could never be friends with somepony who's so focused on things being possible that he's willing to turn his back on the coolest hero of all time!
613355 Fine!
61300c Fine!
61300c Look, just tell A. K. Yearling that Rainbow Dash is here, and I need her help to convince a know-it-all pony that everything Daring Do's ever done actually happened!
613000 [beat]
613356 Rainbow Dash?
61300c A. K.! I gotta talk to you. It's an emergency!
613356 [hushed] Not here!
613000 [door opens, slams]
613356 [hushed] Now tell me, what's going on? Is it Caballeron? Did you see him?
61300c What? No. But there is a pony downstairs who thinks everything you've written after the first trilogy is totally unrealistic and terrible. And I need you to help me prove to him that it's all totally possible.
613356 I've got bigger problems on my hooves than dissatisfied fanponies.
613000 [amulet clinking]
61300c Whoa!
613356 The Amulet of Culiacan, and Caballeron wants it. But the amulet's only a key. [chuckles] The real treasure is hidden in a lost temple. The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc. Caballeron wants to sell it to the highest bidder, of course, which is why I need to find it first.
61300c Yes! Sounds like another awesome Daring Do adventure! But... what are you doing here?
613356 Since I haven't found the temple yet, it's the safest place for me and the amulet. It's crawling with security, and if I get into trouble...
613000 [coat flaps]
61314e ...I can just blend in with all the Daring Do cosplayers.
61300c How can I help?
61314e Just keep your eyes out for anything suspicious.
61300c Got it!
613000 [whoosh]
613000 [knocking]
613000 [door opens]
61300c Does a pony who only likes your first trilogy qualify as suspicious?
613000 [beat]
61300c Heh, just checking.
613000 [door closes]
613000 [camera clicks]
613202 [sighs] I find all this fanfare around my archenemy... disturbing. [to salespony] I mean, where is the booth for Caballeron?
613000 [beat]
613202 I do not see the likeness. Come, let us find Daring Do and the Amulet of Culiacan. I don't want to spend any more time in this place than I have to!
613000 [thump]
613355 Well, if it isn't the pony who know impossible things can happen because she just does!
61300c Ugh! Sorry, Quibble, I've got more important things to do than argue with a pony who thinks awesome means unrealistic.
613000 [smack]
613355 No, wait! I want to hear more about how you're one hundred percent sure that in Curse of the Jungle Queen, Daring Do could survive a sixty-story drop from the top of a waterfall after sustaining a broken wing in a category-six rapid!
61300c Ugh! Obviously, her wing wasn't broke— Caballeron!
613355 See, now that's a great character. Solid backstory, good motivations...
61300c No-no-no-no! Caballeron is right there!
613355 Of course he is. He's also over there, over there... Ooh, ooh, over there, and and over there. Where are you going?
613000 [door opens]
613355 And we're out here because...?
61300c Daring Do told me that Caballeron came to this convention to steal the Amulet of Culiacan, and I just saw him and his henchponies come this way!
613355 Okay. I'm gonna head back inside. There's just a little too much crazy out here for the both of us.
613000 [fwump]
61300c [gasps]
613000 [fwump]
613202 I do not know what Daring Do is playing at, but if she told you two fanponies of my plan to steal the amulet, you must work for her.
61300c Caballeron! Hah! What do you have to say now, Quibble?
613355 This was your plan to prove the Daring Do books are realistic? You bought a Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, really?
61300c What?! No! Look around us! Henchponies, Caballeron, the jungle it took forever to get to? This is the real deal!
613355 Right. We're actually being held captive by Caballeron. Please! This guy's accent is all over the place! No offense.
613202 I...
613355 So what's the setup here? You've... kidnapped us, and taken us to the middle of nowhere because...?
613202 The Temple of Chicomoztoc is somewhere in this jungle. When I find it, the Seven-Sided Chest is as good as mine! I just need the Amulet of Culiacan to unlock it.
613355 Uh-huh, and Daring Do has the amulet so you came up with this over-complicated plot to lure her into the jungle and exchange it for us.
613202 I wouldn't call it over-complicated, but... yes.
613355 Okay, we're done here. Great work. Seriously, very believable.
613000 [smacking]
613355 [grunts] Listen, pal, you can keep her money, but I'm not—
613202 Going anywhere! You may not approve of my plan, but I'm the mastermind here!
613355 [aside] Debatable...
613202 And I say you will remain here until Daring Do comes to rescue you. And if she wants you back in one piece, she will give me the amulet! Tie them up!
613000 [chains clinking]
61300c The Griffon's Lock!
613202 You know of it? Further proof that you are an agent of Daring Do!
613355 Or an avid reader.
613000 [chains clinking]
613202 And now I will continue my search for the temple. Don't go anywhere. [long, drawn out evil laughter]
613355 Listen, if I pretend to believe this nonsense is real, will you call off the henchpony repertory theater over there?
61300c They're not gonna listen to me. They abducted us both.
613355 Oh, wow, so you're gonna stick with that script? O-Okay, fine. We're, we're in a Daring Do Adventure. [grunts]
613000 [clink]
613357 What was that?!
613355 [unconvincingly] Daring Do. Thank goodness. We're over here.
613357 Fan out! We can't let Daring Do rescue these two!
61300c [straining]
613355 [laughing] All four?! I mean, shouldn't at least one of them stay behind to guard us? Oh, oh, wait, the... No, because then it wouldn't be a terrible Daring Do adventure.
61300c It doesn't matter. We'll never solve the Griffon's Lock before they get back.
613000 [click]
613000 [chains clinking]
61300c Okay, that was pretty good. Quick, we've gotta get out of here and warn Daring Do!
613355 No way. Just point me to the hotel and you can play fanpony and hunt treasure out here all day long.
61300c [sighs] Fine. Let's just say this is a Daring Do Adventucation. The only way to get back to the convention is to go through it. So just follow me, and I'll lead you out. Deal?
613355 I... [groans] Fine.
61300c [under her breath] Maybe if I just leave you in the jungle, it'll convince you.
613355 ...which would make Daring Do left-hoofed, which we know is false, and that is everything that's wrong with Daring Do and the Trek to the Terrifying Tower. Now, the problems with the next book are even— Oh, right. What Daring Do adventure would be complete without the precarious rope bridge?
613000 [bridge creaking]
613355 Look, I'm all for making things feel as real as possible, but are these Adventu-cation ponies sure this thing is safe?
61300c Is it too "realistic" for you? Wouldn't want that on a Daring Do adventure, would we?
613355 If this were really a real Daring Do adventure, I'm sure I'd step on the wrong plank at exactly the wrong—
613000 [wood crunches]
613355 Whoa!
61300c [straining]
613355 [sighs] Good thing this is all just a pretend adventure. Least we know all of this struggling won't make the bridge fall apart.
613000 [snap]
613355 You need to get your money back.
613000 [snap]
613355 [screaming]
613000 [splashing]
613355 [yelping and screaming]
61300c Hah! How's that for not possible?
613355 That was... awesome! I-I-I thought we... and then you, and the flying...! Wow, and I was like, "Where are you going?!" A-a-and then you swerved, and I was, I was, I was on the water, and then the rocks?! Wow!
61300c Yeah. If you read that in a book, you might even think it was unrealistic.
613355 Okay, I'll give you that one. I mean we could have been done for. [beat] We could have been done for! W-What kind of Adventu-cation is this?! I mean, that's just, that's just bad business! What, what are these ponies thinking?!
613202 Right now? We are thinking that we should thank you for escaping. For you have led us directly to the Lost Temple of Chicomoztoc! [laughing]
613202 Make sure they are secure this time! We can't have them escaping again.
61300c [straining] You'll never get away with this!
613202 Won't I? You've led me to the temple, and Daring Do is too noble to let harm befall her companions, so the amulet is as good as mine. What? No witty remarks this time about how silly my plan is?
613355 This isn't the official Daring Do Experience Adventu-cation, is it.
61300c Finally!
613355 It's some cheap knockoff run by a bunch of incompetent ponies that have no idea how to execute this adventure with any level of safety!
61300c Ugh!
613355 What was that with the bridge?! We were in serious danger! I-I'm reporting you all to... well, I don't know who I'm reporting you to, but it's gonna be somepony important! Oh, and this cut-rate excuse for an "Experience" hasn't proved anything except that I'm right! It has all the hallmarks of a lame Daring Do adventure!
613000 [mud rushing]
61300c Uh... Quibble?
613355 No, I'm talking! Generic jungle location – check. Overly complicated villain plot – check. Random coincidences that conveniently get us to the next big set piece – check!
613000 [stone moving]
613202 Watch where you are stepping, you fool!
613355 Listen, buddy, I don't take orders from some second-rate performer who learned acting from the Supervillain School of Bad Accents! The only thing this mess is missing is some giant Ahuizotl wannabe monster, and I have a feeling that would be a bit too much for you bargain-basement adventurers to pull off!
613000 [mud dripping]
613355 Huh?
613358 [roars]
613355 Um... you're real. This is real. This is real!
613000 [click]
613358 [roars]
613000 [splash]
613000 [Daring Do leitmotif plays]
61314e I told you to warn me of anything suspicious, not run off on an adventure without me!
613355 Wha... Whoa, whoa, y-you're real! You-you-you're friends with her?
61314e Uh, we'll have to do introductions later. Right now we have to—
613355 G-Get out of here, yes! Thank you!
61314e Actually, no.
613355 What?!
61314e We can't leave without the treasure. And we should probably get to it before our friend gets any higher.
613358 [roars]
613000 [splash]
613000 [stone moving]
61300c Whoa!
61314e Seven doors, seven locks. One of them leads to the treasure. I'd rather not think about what the others lead to.
613355 Yeah, yeah, the classic "Pony and the Tiger" bit. All you have to do is—
61300c Um, maybe you should let Daring Do figure it out?
613355 Oh, 'scuse me.
61314e [scratching chin]
613355 [coughs] Not that one.
613000 [amulet clinks]
613355 Ehhhhh...
61314e Is he always like this?
61300c Yeah. But... he's usually right.
61314e [sighs] Which lock do you think it is?
613355 Ugh, finally. Look, each door has another door that matches. These two both have Earth ponies fighting serpents. These two have Pegasi fighting griffons. These two have unicorns fighting bears. But this one...
61314e ...has an Alicorn on it! It's the only one without a match! How did I miss that?
613355 I've been asking myself that ever since book four!
613000 [rattling]
613355 The Seven-Sided Chest of Chicomoztoc!
613000 [ding!]
613355 Uh, guys...?
613000 [water pouring]
61300c Uh... The way out is totally covered! How are we gonna get out of here?!
61314e There!
613355 Seriously, do you ever not escape out of the top of a temple?!
61314e We'll have to carry Mr Adventure Critic out with us!
61300c We won't be fast enough! We'll never make it!
613355 Guys! I think Rainbow Dash and I have this covered.
613000 [splashing]
613000 [monster roars]
613355 Go around! You can't go over him!
61314e Go over him?! Are you crazy?!
61300c If Quibble says go over him, we go over him!
613358 [roars]
613355 [screams]
613000 [leaves rustling]
613000 [birds twittering]
613355 You two are insane!
61300c You said go over him!
613355 I said go around him!
61314e [hushed] And I said be quiet!
613202 This way! I heard them!
613355 [hushed] Okay, I got it. Let's create a fake treasure out of mud and rocks, give that to Caballeron, and then we—
61314e [hushed] Not every Daring Do plan has to be super-complicated.
613000 [rock clinking]
613202 Rrrgh! I swear I heard them!
613000 [wall crumbling]
613358 [roars]
613359 [screaming]
613202 I'll get you, Daring Dooooo!
613000 [splash]
613355 Meh. Not particularly original or inspired, but it worked.
61314e Who were you again?
61300c He's a fan.
61314e [unconvinced] Uh-huh. [normal] There's some stairs on the other side of the temple that lead out of the ravine. I suggest you two take them and head west.
61300c What about you?
61314e I've gotta get this to a museum. Thanks for your help. I couldn't have done it without you. Both of you.
613000 [whoosh]
61300c So...?
613355 So... maybe the later books are slightly more realistic than I gave them credit for. Still don't like them.
61300c What?! How can you—?!
613355 Wait, hold on. Before we get in another fight, I-I think I finally figured it out! I love the Daring Do that solves puzzles and uses her brain to get out of tough situations, and she did way more of that in the original trilogy! You love the Daring Do that is brave and awesome and comes out on top no matter what the odds!
61300c Okay...?
613355 And that's okay! We might never agree on what makes Daring Do cool, but you... are definitely cool. I-I mean, the way you saved me on the bridge? Wow! And escaping from the temple... you, Rainbow Dash, are awesome.
61300c Well... I-I'm not the one who can locate a treasure in half the time Daring Do can! You may have terrible taste in books, but you're pretty awesome yourself. In a brainy, egghead, puzzle-solving kind of way. Heh.
613355 I guess we don't have to agree on everything to get along. Friends?
61300c Definitely friends.
613355 Uh, do you think A. K. Yearling would consider letting me write the next book? I... I think I can make things way clearer. I mean, for instance, in the second adventure...
613000 [Quibble continues talking over credits]
613355 ...there's a side character. I don't want to kind of name it right now, because it's sort of this thing that I've already written a lot of fan fiction on. I don't want you to... Not that I'm saying that you would steal it! But I am saying this would totally go along my whole thing about puzzle-solving, except what if each puzzle that was solved, uh, unlocked a new karate move? Think of it that way, right? And I mean I'm kind of a "Yearlite" myself, so I'm sure she'd be open to—
61300c Uh... Quibble?
613355 Sorry!
614000 [students chattering]
614183 Good morning, Miss Cheerilee!
61405b Good morning, everypony! I hope you brought your thinking caps, because today we're going to learn about physics!
614065 Physics?
61405b Mm-hmm! Specifically, the use of force in energy conversions! In this case, using mechanical work to convert potential energy into kinetic energy!
61400a The what now?
614066 Um, Miss Cheerilee? That sounds a bit over our heads.
614065 Yeah. Why would we even need to know that stuff?
61405b Oh, it's very important. In fact, you'll most likely end up using it tomorrow.
61400a Tomorrow? What for?
61405b Why, for participating in the... Applewood Derby!
614000 [students gasping and cheering]
614035 Oh, phew! For a second, I thought we were gonna have to, you know, learn stuff.
614000 [theme song]
614000 [students chattering]
614065 We get to race in the Applewood Derby tomorrow? That's so cool!
61400a My family's talked about it for years, and now I'm finally old enough to race!
614000 [knocking]
61405b Now hold on to your horseshoes, everypony. You've got a lot of work to do before you're ready to race.
614036 Yeah, but... not schoolwork, right?
61405b There'll be a block of applewood just like this one waiting for you at Sweet Apple Acres tomorrow, and you've got one day to turn it into a race-ready cart.
614000 [students groaning]
614065 Oh, yeah... That is a lot of work.
61405b Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each get to pick an older pony to help you! But choose wisely, because they'll also have to ride in the cart with you during the race.
614065 Hmmm... I think I know just the pony to ask.
614066 Me too!
61400a Me three!
61405b Just remember, everypony. Your cart has to be able to finish the race if you want to win one of the awards. Fastest – for winning the race, naturally. Most traditional – for the best working replica of an original Applewood cart. And most creative – for the cart with the best overall design.
61400a [dreamily] Hoo-wee! Those ribbons are the bees' knees.
614183 [dreamily] Uh-huh...
61405b All right then, class! You've got a lot to learn if you want to build a race cart.
614000 [students groaning]
614036 Aww... I knew there was gonna be a catch!
614066 Wow! Have you seen what the carts used to look like in the olden days?
61400a Yeah, I know all about them. When Ponyville started the Derby, they decided to use the wood from our apple trees for the carts. The race has been a part of Sweet Apple Acres ever since.
614066 I just think these old carts look so cool! But I guess you and Applejack will probably win the award for the most traditional, huh?
61400a The Apples usually do, but honestly, I'd rather build the fastest cart there is and win the race!
614000 [wings buzzing]
61400a But... I'm pretty sure Scoot and Rainbow Dash'll take that award.
614065 You know, I race around so much on my scooter, being the fastest isn't such a big deal. Maybe I'll try to make the wildest looking cart I can think of!
61400a Really?
614065 Sure! If I win most creative, you can totally win the award for fastest!
614066 And I can win the award for most traditional!
61400a Sounds like we're all gonna try somethin' different. I can't wait to tell Applejack!
614065 Let's get to it!
614080 Go, Crusaders!
61400c Are you kidding?! Of course I'll help with the Applewood Derby! I want you to have as much fun as I did when I was a filly!
614065 Wait, Cloudsdale has a derby too?
61400c Sure! Practically every town in Equestria has one! [sighs] I still remember racing my cloud cart...
6140b7 This is so awesome! Woo-hoooooo!
614065 And lemme guess. You won fastest cart.
61400c Heh, obviously!
614065 So what do you say? Will you help me make my race cart?
61400c Help you? I'm all over it! I've got tons of ideas.
614065 Don't worry, I've got a lot of— Whoa. Ideas of my own. Um...
614000 [vase breaks]
614065 What are you looking for?
61400c The blueprint for my derby cart, of course! I'll have to change it a little, 'cause this race is on roads, not on clouds. But trust me, your cart is gonna be amazing!
614000 [thudding]
614065 Um, okay, Rainbow Dash, thanks! How awesome is this? With Dash on my team, how could anything go wrong?
614008 Well, I'm mighty flattered you wanna work with your big sis on your cart. I mean, the Applewood Derby did—
61400a —start on our farm. I know.
614008 Well, I couldn't be more proud to help my little sister take the prize for most traditional.
61400a Actually, I was kinda thinking of somethin' else. Like... fastest?
614008 [scoffs] Fastest? Apple Bloom, things aren't like they were in the old days. The fastest cart now has gotta be slick and modern and—
61400a Exactly!
614008 Not Apple at all. The Apples win most traditional. We have since the Derby started! Why would anypony want to win anythin' else? Now why don't you head off and get some chamomile vines, some hickory sticks, and some apple barrels, and I'll show you what an Apple family cart should look like!
61400a I guess I do have a family tradition to uphold...
61400d [gasps] The Applewood Derby?! [excited giggling] Of course I'll help!
614066 Wow. Uh, Rarity, I didn't know you'd be this excited.
61400d Me? Oh, why, I'm just itching to right an old wrong from long, long ago!
61400d [narrating] I designed my own cart when I was just a filly, and I was positive I was going to win the prize for most creative, hooves down! But I came in second. Second!
614066 You? Second in most creative? To whom?!
614000 [ponies cheering]
614000 [lightning cracks]
61400d [narrating] But I learned a valuable lesson.
61400d I learned to know my audience, and the race cart audience wants big! They want bold!
614000 [door opens]
61400d Chop chop! Everypony out!
61435a [indignant chattering]
61400d We've got work to do!
614000 [door closes]
61400d This will take all of my considerable skills... [humming to self]
614000 [scribbling]
61400d ...but I will fashion the biggest and boldest Derby cart to ever win the prize for most creative!
614066 Actually, I was sorta thinking of something more... traditional?
61400d Oh! [tittering] Please, darling, leave tradition to the Apples. We're doing big, we're doing bold! [humming to self] Soon the prize for most creative will finally be in my hooves!
614066 You mean my hooves.
61400d Yes, that's what I said – my hooves. Darling, I hope you're ready to get an early start tomorrow!
614066 Uh... how early?
614000 [birds twittering]
614000 [cart rattling]
614066 [yawns] [groans] Rarity, the sun's not even up yet.
614008 Oh, apples, quit complainin'! In my day, we were up even earlier!
61400c Hey, I'd get up in the middle of the night if it means my cart crosses that finish line first and wins fastest!
61400d And my cart wins most creative!
614008 And my cart wins most traditional! Hoo-wee, it's gonna be a good day!
614065 You mean our carts, right?
61400d Yes, that's what we said, darling.
614008 Yup.
61400c Our carts.
61400a Their carts? It almost sounds like they're planning on building them without us.
614066 I'm sure they meant "our" carts. Like, the team cart, right?
614065 Of course! I mean, they're all our older sisters. Practically. Plus, they've all done this before. I'm sure they know best. Let's just buckle down and get to work!
614000 [carts rattling]
614000 [chattering and handiwork noises]
614065 [straining]
61400c Scootaloo, where have you been? I've only got 'til noon to make the fastest cart ever!
614065 Uh, about that. I was really thinking of going for the most creative prize. I mean, I know all about speed already, so...
61400c Exactly! It's all about speed! You've gotta get across the finish line to win a prize, so we might as well get there first, right? Hey, I left a bunch of paint cans by the road. Bring them up here, would ya? Nothing as fun as painting racing stripes on the winning cart!
614000 [sawing]
614065 [sighs] Right... Fun...
61400a Spendin' time buildin' a cart with my big sister? Why, this is just tee-riffic! Um... how can I help?
614008 You can feast your eyes on... this! I-I mean, it ain't quite finished yet.
61400a Oh, good.
614008 But don't it have the makin's of the best cart you ever did see? Uh... is somethin' wrong, Apple Bloom?
61400a Actually, I was kinda thinkin' of somethin' a little more modern. And less rickety. With maybe a chance of winning?
614008 Bless my hooves, I thought we covered this! Tradition is all that counts! And who knows tradition better than Apples? Nopony, that's who! So are you an Apple, or are you an Apple? [snorts]
61400a I'm an Apple, but... what if I just take off this fringe?
614000 [crunch]
614008 No, not the fringe!
614000 [crash]
614008 Ugh! Why, shoot! Now I've gotta start all over from scratch, and it's almost race time!
61400a Oh. So, maybe we can redesign it then? Just a little.
614008 No time! And who'd want to redesign somethin' that's already perfect?
61400a Right... Perfect...
614066 Okay, so I sketched out some of my ideas.
614000 [sound of wrenching]
614066 How about a nice yellow fringe on top?
61400d [muffled] Oh-ho-ho-ho, darling, [normal] the fringe is not exactly big! And that yellow is the least bold color I can imagine!
614066 Well, it doesn't have to be yellow. But I really do love the old-timey style. Like this.
61400d Sweetie Belle, precious face, "old-timey" is just another word for passé. Remember, big and bold! I do have a reputation to uphold! It was one thing to lose as a filly, but can you imagine if I didn't win the most creative now? Ponies might stop buying my couture!
614066 But we're supposed to be doing this together!
61400d Yes, of course we are, darling. In fact, we just finished. Voila! I know. You're speechless. Well, if that isn't big and bold, I don't know what is! Isn't it wonderful? [humming to self]
614066 [sighs] Right... Wonderful...
614000 [montage music]
614000 [ponies chattering]
61400a [tired] Hey, Crusader... How's it goin'?
614066 [sighs] Rarity's definitely made the biggest, boldest cart anypony's ever seen.
61400a Wow. Well, Applejack's built somethin' so traditional, it's practically an antique.
614065 [sighs] No matter what I say, there's no talking Rainbow Dash out of making the fastest cart in Equestria.
614066 Doesn't look like any of us ended up with what we wanted.
61400a But... I'm sure our older sisters know what they're doin'. Right?
614065 Right...
614066 Right.
61400a And even if our carts aren't exactly what we had in mind, it'll still be fun to drive them to the finish line.
614066 Sure! The race is the best part!
61400a Yeah! CMCs behind the wheels!
614105 [cheering]
61405b Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line!
61400c The race is about to start, Scootaloo! You better shake a leg if you wanna ride in the winning cart!
61400d You, too, Sweetie Belle. There's only one seat left aboard this creative masterpiece, and it's just for you. Woo-hoo!
614008 Whoa, ponies! Wait for me! This traditional cart handles at the exact perfect pace – slow! And I got the passenger seat all warmed up for ya, Apple Bloom!
61400a Passenger seat?!
614000 [carts rolling]
614065 [grunts] They're the only older ponies driving!
614066 First they built the carts, now they're gonna drive them?!
61400a I know they were all excited to help, but I don't think they're really helping anymore.
614065 We better hurry if we wanna be a part of this race at all!
61405b Um, aren't you all missing somepony?
614008 They'll be along.
61405b And, uh, [hushed] usually the younger ponies drive the carts.
61400d [chuckles] Darling, do these look like usual carts to you?
614000 [seat belts clicking]
61405b [blows fanfare] Racers! On your marks, get set, go!
614066 [screams]
614065 [screams]
61400a [scream turns into a grunt] Can't we go any faster?!
614008 Faster? Don't be silly. This is perfect!
61400a [groans]
614000 [carts rolling]
61400f [Ponies]
61400f Go, go, go!
614008 [Applejack]
614008 Check me out, racin' the Derby
614008 Check out my old-fashioned cart
61400d [Rarity]
61400d Check me out, racing the Derby
61400d In my original work of art
61400c [Rainbow Dash]
61400c Check me out, faster than ever
61400c There's nopony can catch me now
614080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
614080 Let me out, I'd do it over
614080 If I only knew how!
61400f [Ponies]
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Go, go, go!
61400d [Rarity]
61400d My cart's the most original
61400d Designed with imagination
614008 [Applejack]
614008 My cart's the most traditional
614008 Just plain, no complications
61400c [Rainbow Dash]
61400c Look at me, I am the ace
61400c Might as well give up the chase
614080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
614080 Wish we could stop this race
614080 Start again and do it our way
614065 Having any fun yet?
61400a Nope! Maybe if we could go a little faster!
61400f [Ponies]
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Go, go, go!
61400d [Rarity]
61400d Gotta get some attention
61400d If I want that ribbon
61400c [Rainbow Dash]
61400c Gotta push the limit further
61400c Blow away the competition
614008 [Applejack]
614008 Gotta coast on through
614008 Just relax, we're gonna cruise it
61400a [Apple Bloom]
61400a Guess I don't really care
61400a Since we're clearly gonna lose it
61400d [Rarity]
61400d See, everypony's watching
61400d Presentation is a glory
61400c [Rainbow Dash]
61400c Just passed you, even faster
61400c Speed is king, end of story
61400d [Rarity]
61400d Bigger, bolder down the track
614008 [Applejack]
614008 Love the view from the back of the pack
61400c [Rainbow Dash]
61400c Won't stop, we're on the attack
614080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
614080 Too late to take it all back!
61400f [Ponies]
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Giddyup, derby racers
61400f Go, go—
614080 Look out!
614000 [crash]
614000 [ponies groaning]
61400d Oh! My beautiful swan cart is an ugly duckling!
614008 And my old-time cart is a rootin' tootin' wreck!
61400c [straining] It still counts as a win if I push my cart across, right?
614000 [wheel bouncing]
614080 They're not your carts!
61403e Huh?
61400a We were supposed to design them!
614065 And we were supposed to drive them!
614066 The Derby was supposed to be for us, not the three of you! Now you've ruined it for everypony!
61400d Mmmh...
614000 [crunch]
61400d Yes, well, I suppose we might have gotten a teensy bit carried away...
614008 But I thought you all wanted our help.
61400a We did! We wanted your help to build our carts. But we all ended up with carts that are what each of you wanted!
614105 Mm-hmm.
61400c But why didn't you say anything?
614065 You've all done the race before. I just figured you knew best!
614066 Plus it's hard to speak up to older ponies.
61400d Oh, I certainly understand that. But you mustn't think older ponies automatically know best.
61400c And we probably could have done a better job of listening to you.
614008 Oof. I guess we owe all three of you an apology.
61400a Maybe not just us.
61400c [nervous laugh] Um, how do you feel about a do-over?
61405b I think that's a wonderful idea! But maybe the older ponies should sit this one out.
614065 Thanks for helping us fix up our carts. Pretty creative, right?
61400a I know it's not traditional, but it sure looks fast, don't it?
61400d You know, darling, I can't believe I'm saying this, but that yellow fringe is rather bold after all.
614066 Thanks, everypony. We couldn't have done it without you.
614000 [carts rolling]
614008 Yup, I sure am glad Miss Cheerilee agreed to run the race over again.
61405b Well, it isn't every year I get to say this twice, but... Derby racers to the starting line! Derby racers to the starting line! Racers! On your marks, get set... go!
614000 [foals cheering]
61400c And it's probably best keeping all the grown-ups on the sidelines. But... what are we supposed to do now?
61400d I think I have an idea.
61400d [sipping through straw] Ahhh! Much better! Honestly, I'm not sure why we wanted to race those carts in the first place.
61400c Seriously! [sighs] This is the most relaxed I've been all day.
614000 [spectators cheering]
614000 [carts rolling]
61400c Go, Scootaloo, go! Woo-woo-woo-woo! Uhh, I mean... [nervous laugh] This is the life. Right, ponies? [sighs]
614000 [credits]
615000 [nighttime noises]
61500e I'm so sorry I lost track of time at our picnic. I didn't mean for us to get caught out here after dark. But there's really nothing to be afraid of. The forest at night is the same as the forest during the day.
615000 [wind gusts, howls]
61500e Only... darker.
6152f9 [teeth chattering]
61500e Still, maybe we should hurry back to the cottage.
615000 [whoosh]
61500e Nothing to worry about. No reason to...
615000 [whoosh]
61500c [eerie wailing]
61500e Ruuuun!
615000 [zip]
61500e Aah! [gasping]
61500c [eerie wailing]
615000 [thunderclap]
615000 [roars]
61500e [screams]
61500c [laughs] Gotcha! [laughs harder]
61500e [hyperventilating] That wasn't funny! You really scared me! I hope you're happy.
6152f9 [growls]
61500c Nope. You're too easy. You're scared of everything.
61500e That's not true.
61500c Boo.
61500e Aah! [chattering]
6152f9 [grunts]
615000 [theme song]
61500c I mean, how could you not appreciate that?
61500e Because I don't think being scared is very fun!
615007 I do! Your heart gets all racy, your hooves get all tingly, your mouth gets all dry-ie! Actually, I don't like that part. But the rest is great!
61500c See? Everypony likes a good prank! They're just jokes!
61500d Now, Rainbow Dash, I don't think Fluttershy would have called us all here to talk about this if she thought it was funny. Everypony has things they like and things they don't.
615008 And scarin' Fluttershy is just lazy.
61500c [scoffs] Lazy?!
615003 A prank isn't very good if you're the only pony laughing.
615007 But what if it's really, really, really, really, really funny?
61500c And I can do funny.
615003 I know you can. I guess the trick is making sure that your idea of funny matches the pony you're pranking.
61500c [stifling giggle]
615003 That way—
615000 [prolonged fart noise]
61500c [laughs]
615007 [stifling laugh]
615030 [laughing]
615007 Good one, Rainbow! Ha-ha! You have to admit! That was funny!
615003 Not really.
615008 Yeah. A whoopee cushion is like a joke shortcut.
615030 What?!
61500d Honestly, Rainbow Dash, if you are not willing to put forth the effort required to pull a prank that everypony can enjoy, you may as well not pull one at all.
61500c Fine! If you ponies want effort, then that's just what you'll get.
615003 I'm not sure she understood what we meant.
61500d I know you're excited about the Filly Guide Cookie Drive, but I still have to do a few finishing touches on your uniform.
615000 [beat]
615066 [lips smacking] Hmm. Not bad.
61500d Huh. [reading] "You asked for it."
615066 What does it mean?
61500d Hmm. I assume this is Dash's idea of a prank, which can only mean she's rigged some kind of booby trap to your Filly Guide uniform up there.
615066 So how do we get it down?
61500d We don't. If Dash thinks I'm going to fall for whatever she's got in mind, she's got another thing coming. There's more uniforms where that one came from!
615000 [splat]
615066 Hmm. The sewing machine cake is actually better than the cake cake.
61500d Rainbow Dash!
61500c [laughs] Gotcha! Ha-ha! How's that for effort?
615000 [pans clang]
615000 [bells jingle]
61500a What's all this, Applejack? I thought you were gonna help me get ready for the Filly Guide Cookie Drive.
615008 Uh, yeah, sorry about that. But Rainbow Dash has been on a prankin' tear, and you can never be too careful.
61500a Do you really think Dash is gonna try and prank you in your sleep?
615008 Not if I have anythin' to say about it.
615000 [click]
615008 See ya in the mornin', sugarcube.
615000 [pig oinks]
615008 Huh?!
615000 [rooster crows]
615008 Whoa!
615000 [splut]
615000 [pan clanks]
61500c Ha! Still think I'm lazy? Gotcha! [laughing] Pigpen...
615008 [grunts] Ugh! Rainbow Dash!
615000 [splat]
615000 [pig oinking]
615000 [polka music]
615000 [skunk sprays]
61500c [laughs] Gotcha!
615000 [music continues]
615005 [blows fire]
615000 [thunk]
615005 [blows fire]
615000 [thunk]
615005 [blows fire]
615000 [thunk]
615005 [blows fire]
615000 [thunk]
615005 [blows fire]
615000 [thunk]
615000 [loud thud]
615000 [sloop]
61500c Gotcha!
615000 [clang!]
61500c Gotcha!
615000 [students laughing]
61500c Gotcha!
615003 Pinkie! We need your help.
615007 Okay! For what?
61500d Are you honestly going to stand there and tell us you know nothing about all the pranking Rainbow Dash has been doing?
615007 Oh, no! She's been pranking up a storm!
61500e Did she get you, too?
615007 [laughs] Oh, yeah! She and Gummy both!
61500c Boo!
615007 Aaah! [giggling]
615007 They got me good.
615008 Well, she needs to stop.
615007 Stop? But pranks are so much fun!
615003 Not for everypony. And it doesn't seem like Dash is taking the time to find out who enjoys them and who doesn't.
61501f [grumble]
61500d Uh, since you and Dash share such an, uh, affinity for pranking, we thought you might be able to get her to, um, uh... quit it!
615007 Hey, Rainbow Dash! I have something very important to tell you!
61500c Pinkie, hey! I actually have something totally important to tell you!
615007 You do? Ooh! You go first!
61500c Okay, you know how I've been pranking everypony?
615007 Yeah! [giggles] It's been pretty funny! I-I-I mean, actually, that's what I have to talk to you about.
61500c Here. Have a cookie.
615007 Ooh! Thanks! [chomps]
61500c So, I got to thinking – why waste my time pranking everypony one at a time when I could prank everypony at once?
615007 Mmm, wow! Everypony at once?! That sounds amazing!
615000 [record needle scratches]
615007 Gah, wait! I mean, it's not.
61500c You don't even know what it is yet! Pinkie, this is gonna be the best prank ever! I special ordered these joke cookies so the colors would match my mane.
615007 And?
61500c And I'm gonna switch them with the Filly Guide cookies. When Scootaloo and her friends sell them, everypony in town's gonna get a rainbow mouth courtesy of Rainbow Dash! Ha-ha! It's gonna be so awesome!
615007 Uh, I don't know. I mean, it doesn't really seem all that funny.
61500c [gasps] What?!
615007 Maybe this is a good time to stop pranking for a while. The other ponies in town really—
61500c Stop?! No way! This prank is happening, Pinkie! And it's gonna be hilarious!
615007 [chomps]
61500c Pinkie, what's the deal? I told you I needed your help switching out all the Filly Guide cookies for the joke cookies. But when you didn't show, I had to do it all by myself! Uh, Pinkie?
615007 [coughs]
61500c [chuckles] Wow. Your face is still pretty rainbowed.
615007 Yeah, I haven't really [coughs] been feeling well. And these joke cookies are the only thing that makes me feel better. You don't have any more, do you?!
61500c Uh, no. I just told you, I used them all for the prank.
615007 Oh.
61500c Pretty soon, the CMCs will start selling them to everypony in town. Ponies will open their boxes and start eating, then all of their teeth will turn rainbow-colored, and they'll know it was me! It's gonna be so awesome! C'mon, you don't wanna miss it!
615007 Actually... [coughs] I don't think I can even... stand... up... [raspy] Unless you've got more cookies!
61500c Aah! On second thought, maybe you better stay here and rest.
615007 [sighs] Yeah. You're right. Sorry to miss out. I'm sure it's gonna be hilarious.
61500c All right, who's ready to sell some cookies?
615080 Me!
615008 Look here, Rainbow Dash. I know you promised Scootaloo you'd help out, but I don't want none of your pranks ruinin' these fillies' night.
61500c Look, I'll be with you the whole night so you can totally keep an eye on me.
61500a Come on, Applejack! Let's get started!
615065 Yeah! We've got a lot of ground to cover!
615066 We wanna hit every house in Ponyville!
61500c Come on! You heard her! Every house in Ponyville! [laughs]
615000 [knocking]
6152f9 [growls loudly]
615080 [scream]
615000 [knocking]
615000 [doors creaking]
615000 [bits clinking]
61500c [laughing]
615008 I think you three should be real proud. Y'all did a mighty impressive job for your first go-'round.
61500d You took the words right out of my mouth, Applejack. Isn't that right, Rainbow Dash?
61500c [hushed] Any minute now.
615008 Uh... "any minute now" what?
61500c Huh? Oh, uh, nothing! Have you guys noticed how quiet it's gotten? I mean, it's still early, right?
61500d Of course it's quiet. Ponies can't talk while they're eating those fabulous cookies, heh.
61500c You think?
61500d Of course. They're probably all in a cookie coma right now.
61500c Huh... Maybe you're right. I'll go check.
61500c What is going on...? Okay. Definite cookie-eating happening. But... where is everypony? They must have seen their rainbow mouths by now... They should all be running out into the streets! Unless everypony went to bed early...
61500c Pinkie?
615000 [crunch]
61500c The whole town got the cookies, and now everypony is shut up in their houses! You don't think there's something wrong with the joke cookies, do you?
615000 [clatter]
615000 [clatter]
61500c Mrs Cake! Phew! Have you seen Pinkie? I was thinking I might have something to do with her not feeling great.
61502a [chewing, husky breathing]
61500c Uh... Mrs.. Cake...?
61502a [droning] Cookies...! Cookies!
61500c [whimper] Uh, I can see you're busy! I'll come back!
615000 [thud]
61500c Uhh!
615007 [droning] Cookies...!
61500c [screams]
61502a [droning] More... cookies...!
61513c [burbling]
61502a [droning] Cookies...!
61535b [droning] Cookies... cooooooooooooookiiiiiiiiiiieeeeeees...
61513c [burbling]
61535b [droning] Moooooore cooooookies...
615000 [door opens]
615007 [droning] More cookies...
61500c [whimpering, gasps]
61535c [moaning]
61500c [panting]
615000 [munching]
61500c [pant] Twilight! [pant] You gotta come with me to Sugarcube Corner! Something's going on with the Cakes! Well, not something exactly. I mean, it may have something to do with these joke cookies...
615000 [beat]
615003 [droning] Cooooooookies...
615005 [groans]
61500c Oh, no!
615003 [droning] Coooooookies...
615005 [groans]
61500c [whimpers] Fluttershy—
61500e [droning] Cooooooookies...
6152f9 [low growl]
615000 [door opens, slams]
61500c [panting]
615009 [groans] [droning] Cooooooookiiiiiiieeeeeeees...
615000 [crunch]
615009 [droning] Cookies...
615008 You sure you don't mind us all comin' over?
61500d Oh, of course not. I think the girls have earned a little celebration for all of their hard work. And I have plenty of sewing machine cake left over. Unless anypony wants a cookie...?
61500c Don't touch those!
61500d Oh! There is certainly no call for that! There's plenty for everypony.
61500c Come on! We gotta get outta here!
615008 What in tarnation are you goin' on about?
61500c There's no time! You have to follow me!
61500d Oh, Rainbow Dash, if you want all of those cookies, you will have to buy them, just like everypony else.
61500c I don't want the cookies—!
615000 [ponies groaning]
61500c But they do!
61500d Wh-wh-what... What's happening?
61500c I'll explain later. Come on!
61500c [panting]
615066 We need to find somewhere to hide!
615009 Cookie! Cookie!
615008 This way!
615000 [ponies groaning]
615000 [bucking]
61500c [spits, pants] Did we lose them?
615065 [pants] Why are we running from the ponies of Ponyville?
615066 What happened to all of our friends?
61500c [sighs] I think it's something in the cookies.
615008 Ugh! That's ridiculous! Filly Guide cookies haven't changed for years! It's not like there's a new ingredient that's turnin' the whole town into cookie-cravin' zombies.
61500c Uh, unless there... is...
61500d What are you saying?
615008 What did you do?
615000 [crunch]
61535d [droning] Coooooookiiiiiiiieeeee... coooooookiiiiiiieeee....
615000 [door rattling]
61500c Cover the windows!
61535d Coooook...
615000 [pounding on door]
61535d [droning] Cooooooookieeeee..... cooookiiiiieeeeeeee... [etc.]
61500c [pants] Okay! So I may have switched all the Filly Guide cookies for joke cookies that were supposed to make ponies' mouths rainbow but somehow turned everypony into mindless cookie-eating zombies instead! I figure we just hide out here until the effects wear off, and as long as nopony else eats the cookies, we'll be fine.
61500d That's lovely, darling, except for one thing... [droning] We've already eaten theeeeeeeeeemmmmm...
615008 [droning] Looks like your prank up and backfiiiirrrrreeeeed...
61500c [screams]
615080 [droning] Cooooooookiiiieeeees...
615000 [thud]
61500c [gasps]
615000 [crunch]
615000 [zombie ponies groaning]
61500c No, no! Stay away! They're making you sick! You don't want these!
615007 [droning] But we dooooooo... We want cookiiiiiiiieeeeeeees...!
61500c Nngh! Please! Stop! I never meant for this to happen! It was just a harmless prank! It was supposed to be funny! But this isn't funny at all!
615007 [normal] Exactly!
615000 [splats]
61500c What? Wait... What's happening?
61500d Just delighting in pranking the prankster.
615008 [chuckles] Yeah. How does it feel to get some of your own medicine?
61500c So... you're... not sick? None of you are?
615007 Of course not, silly!
6150ec Gotcha!
61500c This... was all... a prank?!
615008 Yep! And you can thank Pinkie Pie. After you told her about your plan to prank the whole town, she got everypony together and came up with a way to turn the tables on you.
615007 Aw, shucks, it was nothing! Just a little something I threw together.
61500c Uh...
615065 Wow! You should see your face!
61500a [laughs] Talk about funny!
61500c [scoffs] Well, I don't think it's very funny! And I'm the one that got pranked! I was really scared! I thought I made everypony sick! You can't just go around—
615003 —pranking whoever you feel like?
61500e Without thinking about how it might make them feel?
61500d Or if they'd even enjoy it?
615008 Or think it's funny?
61500c Yeah! [beat] Ohhh. I see what you did there.
615007 Pranks can be a lot of fun when everypony has a good time. I thought you just needed to see what it's like when they don't.
61500c I guess I did. I'm sorry, everypony. I haven't really been thinking about how other ponies feel.
61500e Well, I hope you learned your lesson.
61500c Totally! You ponies pulled off an amazing prank! I'll have to work extra hard to top it!
615000 [crickets chirping]
61500c Gotcha.
615000 [everypony laughing]
615000 [horror film style music over credits]
616000 [train puffing]
616003 I hope Shining Armor and Princess Cadance don't think it's too soon for me to come back to the Crystal Empire for a visit. But I just know Flurry Heart's grown so much already. I wonder if I'll even recognize her.
61627c She's the only baby they have, Twilight. I think it'll be pretty easy to figure out who she is.
616003 [annoyed grunt]
61627c Sorry. I know you want to visit your niece as much as possible, and I'm excited to see Sunburst again. I just don't wanna fall behind on my friendship lessons back home.
616003 Starlight, your work in Ponyville isn't going anywhere. Besides, I think we all know you can learn about friendship anywhere. Right, Spike?
616005 [deep voice] "Spike?" Who's "Spike"?
61627c Pfft. Uh, you're Spike, Spike. And why are you dressed like that?
616005 [groans] [normal voice] Guys, you're blowing my cover! How'd you even know it was me?
61627c Because you're you... in a coat, hat and glasses. Also, we're the only ones here.
616005 Right.
616003 Spike, why do you need a disguise?
616005 Last time we came to the Crystal Empire, there was a lot goin' on with the new baby and the Crystalling, but I still got mobbed in the street.
61627c I wouldn't say mobbed.
616005 And this is just a family visit. I wouldn't want the presence of Spike the Brave and Glorious to turn it into some kind of circus.
61627c We get it. The Crystal Ponies adore you.
616003 He did save the Empire. Twice. But still, I don't think your presence will turn our visit into a circus.
616005 Not if I find the right disguise, it won't.
616000 [theme song]
61627c Uh, disguise or not, Spike, I don't think you need to worry about being mobbed. Nopony's here.
616000 [wind whistling]
616000 [tumbleweed drifting]
616000 [bird cries]
616005 It's like a ghost town.
616003 I've got a bad feeling about this.
61627c Yeah, this is weird.
616005 I guess I don't need the disguise after all.
616000 [Crystal Ponies cheering]
61635e It's Spike the Brave and Glorious!
6161b4 He's come to save us yet again!
6161b0 Spike! Spike! Spike! Spike!
616005 Save you from what?
61627c Yeah, what's going on?
616003 Why was everypony hiding?
616317 Oh, it sure looks like Princess Twilight and her pupil.
616316 But how can we be sure?
616318 We can't! Either one of them could be the... you know!
616000 [zip!]
616317 [gasps] What if this... [gasps] isn't... [gasps] the real Spike?!
616316 Everypony, run!
616000 [zip!]
616003 Okay. Something strange is definitely going on.
616005 [groans] Ya think?
61635f Who goes there?
61627c Um, you don't recognize the Princess of Friendship?
61635f Of course we recognize her.
616360 But that doesn't mean it's really her.
616005 It's okay, guys. They're with me. And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of the Crystal Empire, am I right?
616360 Huh. It does look like him.
61635f Well, it would, wouldn't it? I'm sorry, but we'll need to see some proof of identification.
616198 We'll take care of things from here.
616003 Oh, Cadance, thank goodness! What's going on?
616193 We can explain, Twily... if it really is you.
616198 Sunshine, sunshine...
61619d ...ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! Mmm!
616193 It's okay, everypony. It's her.
61627c Of course it's her! What's all this about?
616315 A changeling's been spotted nearby.
616003 A changeling?!
616005 That's not good.
616198 No, it's not. After Queen Chrysalis took my place at our wedding and invaded Canterlot with her army of minions, we're not taking any chances.
616315 Changelings feed off of love. And ever since Flurry Heart's Crystalling, the Empire is filled with more love than anywhere in Equestria. It's possible they've come for the baby.
616193 That's why we posted the extra guards, and why we're—
616003 Checking everypony's identity.
616198 I'm sorry for all of this. Flurry Heart's really been looking forward to seeing you.
616319 [coos]
616003 Oh, she's gotten so big! Starlight and I will do whatever we can to help protect her.
616198 To be honest, having you here is already a big relief.
616360 [whispers indistinctly]
616193 Hmm. The royal guards were wondering if Spike the Brave and Glorious would like to join in the search for the changeling.
616005 Really?
616003 Uh, I don't know if that's such a good idea, Spike. It sounds dangerous.
616005 Come on, Twilight, this is Spike the Brave and Glorious you're talking to. Have you ever known me to run from danger?
616003 Um...
616193 He'll be safe with our guards.
616005 Or will your guards be safe with me?
616003 [sighs]
61635f Spike the Brave and Glorious, you've faced the evil changelings before. What can you tell us?
616005 Oh, uh, well, they are changelings, so they can... change.
61635f [to other guards] You hear that? These monsters can look like any of us, so be on guard, guards! Even more than normal.
616005 And they could be anywhere.
616006 [affirming snort]
616005 So we should cover as much ground as possible. You, search that way!
616000 [whoosh]
616005 And you, search that way!
616000 [whoosh]
616005 And... I'll... just search... here, I guess. Not many places to hide. Unless that rock is a changeling. Okay, rock. How do I know you're really a rock? Hmm. Not talkin', huh? Well, you can't fool me! Uhh! Ow! [screams]
616005 Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Oh! Uhh!
616000 [boulder thuds]
616005 Phew! [kisses] Okay. Maybe it's time Spike the Brave and Glorious went back to, uh, protect those guards. Gah! [sighs] Just my reflection. Huh? Ha! Ha-ha! Hmm. Just my imagination, I guess.
616000 [transformation noise]
616005 [screams]
616005 Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-changeling! [stutters]
616361 No, wait! Come back!
616005 [screaming]
616000 [thud]
616005 [screaming] This is unexpected.
616000 [splat]
616361 The ice is pretty slippery. I wouldn't want you to get hurt because of me.
616005 You... saved me?
616361 It's okay. I know you don't wanna be friends.
616005 Wait! I don't understand. Changelings are supposed to be evil... right?
616361 Evil? Oh, not me. All I've ever wanted is a friend.
616361 [narrating] From the moment I first split my egg in the nursery hive...
616000 [changeling larva hissing]
616362 [whimpering]
616361 [narrating] I was part of the attack on Canterlot during the royal wedding, but I'd never seen true friendship like that! And I couldn't just steal it and feed on its love. I wanted to share it!
616000 [explosion]
616361 After that, I knew I couldn't live with my kind anymore. I set off looking for love to share, but...
616005 But... what?
616361 I'm starving! And there's so much love in the Crystal Empire right now. It's what drew me here! But it's drivin' me crazy!
616005 That would be from the royal Crystalling. It's pretty much a giant outpouring of light and love for a new baby.
616361 [hisses] Oh, sorry! I'm just so hungry! If I had a friend, maybe the love we shared could sustain me, but I don't think the Crystal Ponies want to be friends.
616005 What if I told you there was somepony they respect and admire so much, he could convince them to give it a try?
616361 If only that were true.
616005 It is! I mean, I am! It's me, Spike! Spike the Brave and Glorious? I'm sure you've heard of me.
616361 Nope. But I was raised by an evil queen. I'm Thorax. I can't believe you want to help me.
616005 Why? Hasn't anypony ever just been nice to you?
616361 [hisses] Uh! S-Sorry! Kindness like that kind of brings it out. Do you still wanna be my friend?
616005 Of course! And I am one hundred percent sure I can get the whole Crystal Empire to be your friend too.
616361 [hisses]
616005 But... maybe I should just, uh, talk to them first.
616361 [muffled grunting]
61635f What do you mean? Did you see the changeling?
616360 Did you defeat the evil creature?
616005 Defeating a changeling would be brave, but do you know what would be glorious?
61635f Defeating two changelings?
616360 Defeating all the changelings?
616005 Not having to fight the changeling at all! Because I made friends with him.
616000 [guards laughing]
61635f Oh, wow! For a second I thought you were serious!
616360 [laughing] Could you imagine? Friends with a changeling?
616005 I am serious. He wants to be friends!
616000 [guards laughing]
616360 Right!
61635f Not only are you Spike the Brave and Glorious, you're also Spike the Hilarious!
616360 [laughing]
616005 I'm not joking! The changeling is nice!
616000 [guards laughing harder]
616193 I'm sorry, but I don't think it's funny. The Changeling Queen Chrysalis kidnapped Cadance and cast a spell on me.
616000 [zip!]
616193 There's no such thing as a nice changeling.
616005 You're right, Shining Armor. Sorry. That was a... bad joke.
616361 So? So? Uh, what did they say? How many new friends do I have?
616005 Well, it didn't go exactly the way I thought.
616361 [groans] I understand. Well, thanks for trying. I-I guess it's not surprising. How can you expect ponies who looks like this... [transformation noise] to trust something that looks like this? [transformation noise]
616005 I think I might know!
616000 [door opens]
616003 Spike, if you're done searching for the changeling, Starlight and I could use your help. We're working on a protection spell for Flurry Heart, and nopony takes notes like you.
616005 Uh, actually, Twilight, I, uh, wanted to introduce you to my friend, uh... Uh, Crystal, uh... Hoof! Crystal Hoof! [chuckles] My good friend, Crystal Hoof.
616361 Nice to meet you.
616003 Oh. Well, it's, uh, nice to meet you, too. How do you know Spike?
616361 Oh, uh, Spike and I go way back.
616005 To the Equestria Games! That's when we met. We've been pen pals ever since.
616003 Pen pals? Spike! You could have been using my pen pal quill set! Why didn't you tell me?
616005 Well, I... I pretty much only write to him when you and Starlight are... studying.
616361 I like to brag to all my friends about my letters from Spike the Brave and Glorious.
616005 Yeah. [laughs nervously]
616363 [laugh nervously]
616003 Well, I'm sure Starlight and I can manage, if you want to spend time with your friend.
616005 Great! Crystal Hoof promised to take me around the city.
616361 Oh, that was amazing!
616005 I told ya.
616000 [montage music]
61635f [hushed] Crystal Hoof is nearly as entertaining as Spike himself.
616361 [gasps] This place is everything I've ever dreamed of! [hushed] But I can't keep pretending to be a Crystal Pony forever, can I?
616005 Relax. You're winning them over. Pretty soon, nopony will care that you're a changeling.
616198 Spike! Twilight told me you were off with a friend.
616005 [nervous laugh]
616198 And any friend of Spike the Brave and Glorious is a friend of mine.
616319 [coos]
616361 Oh, she's so beautiful! There's so much l-love around her...! I... I...!
616000 [transformation noise]
616361 [hisses]
616198 [gasps]
616314 [gasps]
616361 I... [hisses] I'm so... [hisses] ...sorry...! I can't... Can't [hisses] ...stop!
616003 Spike! Get away from the changeling!
616005 Wait, no! You don't understand!
616315 This changeling replaced your friend to get close to the baby! What other explanation could there be?!
616005 I...
616361 [hisses]
616005 ...I don't know.
616361 [whimpers]
61635f After it! Don't let the changeling escape!
616198 I hope your friend is okay.
616005 Yeah... Me, too.
61635f Spike, you should go find Crystal Hoof while we hunt down the changeling.
616005 I'm pretty sure he doesn't wanna see me.
616193 Spread out! The changeling is probably still nearby!
616005 Actually, I'm pretty sure he ran as far away from here as possible.... But I bet I know where!
616005 Thorax! Hello? I just want to apologize! I should have stood up for you... Aw, come on, Thorax! I know you're in here!
616000 [transformation noise]
616361 Leave me alone! [hisses]
616005 [yelps] [panting] Little help?
616361 Why do you think I would help you? I'm an "evil changeling"!
616005 Because you're my friend. I just wish I had been one to you. [yelps]
616361 It's okay, I know it's hard. Everyone in the Crystal Empire loves you. I couldn't ask you to give that up for me.
616005 You don't have to ask.
616361 What are you gonna do?
616005 What I should've done in the first place.
616006 Let's move! Move! Move! This way! This way! Let's go! Check there? Okay. Over here! Over here! [etc.]
616000 [guards shouting]
61619b Look around that corner! Over there! Over there! [etc.]
61627c I know it's bad that there's a changeling around, but is all this really necessary?
616198 If there's one changeling, there may well be a whole army on the way.
616003 True. But Starlight has a point. This is getting a little out of hand.
616198 [sighs] I understand, but I don't know what else we can do.
616005 I do!
616000 [ponies gasp]
616193 Spike! What are you doing?! Get away from that thing!
616005 No. He's not a "thing"! His name is Thorax, and he's my friend!
616364 [gasp]
616365 [gasp]
61627c [gasp]
616005 [Spike]
616005 Would you say I'm a hero
616005 Glorious and brave
616005 If I told you something you wouldn't believe?
616005 That sometimes I'm scared
616005 And I can make mistakes
616005 And I'm not so heroic, it seems
616005 But if day can turn to night
616005 And the darkness turn to light
616005 Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
616005 No two ponies are exactly the same
616005 No two snowflakes ever match their design
616005 And I thought I was strong
616005 But I was nothing but wrong
616005 When I forgot to be friendly and kind
616005 But if day can turn to night
616005 And the darkness turn to light
616005 Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
616005 Would you say I'm a hero
616005 Glorious and brave
616005 If I told you something you wouldn't believe?
616005 This changeling, it seems
616005 Knows the real me
616005 And would stay by my side 'til the end
616005 So if day can turn to night
616005 And the darkness turn to light
616005 Then why can't we imagine
616005 Just why can't we imagine
616005 Then why can't we imagine a changeling can change?
616000 [long beat]
616003 Spike, I'm so proud of you.
616005 You are?
616003 Of course! You're a celebrity here in the Crystal Empire, and you just risked all of it for a friend! I can't imagine anything more brave than that. [to others] As the Princess of Friendship, I try to set an example for all of Equestria. But today, it was Spike who taught me that a new friend can come from anywhere. I guess everypony still has things to learn about friendship. Even me! And if Spike says Thorax is his friend, then he's my friend too.
616361 Thank you.
616198 On behalf of the Crystal Empire, I would like to extend my hoof in friendship, and I'm sure all of my subjects are eager to do the same.
616000 [guards cheering]
616319 [coos]
616193 Welcome to the Crystal Empire, Thorax. I'm sorry we didn't take the time to get to know you. Maybe we can change that now.
616361 That'd be so amazing! I want to know all about friendship, and maybe one day I can take that knowledge back to the Changeling Kingdom! If my kind learned how to create love for one another, maybe they wouldn't have to take it from others!
61635f To Spike the Brave and Glorious!
616000 [cheering]
61627c Looks like you were right after all.
616003 Right about what?
61627c Friendship lessons can happen anywhere.
616000 [credits]
6170db Tea?
61700e [gasps]
6170db Trendy coats? Bedrolls? Saddlebags? Oh! A surprise vacation just for the two of us? How thoughtful. I hear Puerto Caballo is lovely this time of year. Sand like powdered sugar. [blows]
617000 [sprinkling]
61700e Um, Princess Celestia's taking us on an overnight goodwill tour of Yakyakistan. I just found out.
6170db [gasps] So what you're saying is no tea? Ugh. Well. [clears throat] That's fine. I wasn't thirsty anyway.
61700e If you're looking for something to do, you could spend the evening with Spike and Big Mac.
6170db [laughs]
617000 [beat]
6170db You aren't kidding.
61700e They're very nice. They have a "top secret" thing they do whenever we leave Ponyville. Although everypony knows about it, so it's not a very good secret. I think you'd have fun with them.
6170db Fun? With sidekicks? Oh, you must think that we're in a dimension where everything is opposite. [snap] "Da-dee-la! I'm Opposite Discord, and I want to hang out with Spike and Big Mac! I'm sure I'd have fun!"
617366 Well, guess what, Sassafras?! I'm Opposite Fluttershy, and I'm sick of being nice and quiet all the time!
6170db [snap] Let me explain it to you as simply as I can. Me? Amazing! Them? Well, I've already forgotten who we're talking about. You see?
61700e All I'm saying is it's an opportunity to expand your circle of friends. [coddling] Unless you're afraid they won't like you?
6170db Oh, please. Don't stoop to tedious reverse psychology. You're better than that.
61700e It never hurts to make new friends.
6170db [scoffs] Consider it considered.
617000 [magic poof]
61700e [humming] [gasps]
6170db Couldn't I just come with you instead?
617000 [theme song]
6170db I suppose this is goodbye then. Have an absolutely fabulous voyage. [snap]
617000 [magic zap]
61700e Discord...
6170db [gasps] Well, it's not my fault the new train route leads into an active volcano. Guess you'll have to stay.
617000 [beat]
6170db Oh, you're no fun. [snap]
617000 [magic zap]
617008 I got my bedroll, parka, unattractive but functional hikin' boots... Uh, anything I forgot, Pinkie Pie? You're our resident Yakyakistan expert.
617007 Nope! I brought yeti food!
617000 [beat]
617007 Did I forget to mention there's a pony-eating yeti on Frost Field Glacier? We're gonna have so much fun!
61700c Heh. If he messes with us, I'll turn that yeti into confetti!
617000 [train whistle blows]
617000 [train chugging]
617008 Heh. Somepony's in an awful quick hurry to get us out of here. Don't y'all have too much fun without us.
617003 I bet you boys have big plans. Right, Spike?
617005 I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. Although if I did, I certainly wouldn't be allowed to discuss it with you girls.
617003 Buh-bye!
617000 [train whistle blows]
617008 Bye, y'all!
617000 [train chugging]
617000 [train whistle]
617000 [long beat]
617026 [unintelligible whispering]
617005 [whispering] Uh, I dunno what to say. I mean, I hope he comes but I kinda don't want him to think of it...
617026 [hushed] Yup.
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Fascinating article, yes? [nervous laugh] [hushed, to himself] Don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please don't let them come over, please, please, please— [normal] Oh, salutations, my friend! Wish I could stay and chat, but I don't want to.
617005 Wait! Um, we were wondering... What are you up to tonight?
6170db [to himself] Oh, here we go...
617005 Do you wanna, I don't know, hang out? Is that, like, something you do?
6170db Oh, Twilight's friend and Applejack's monosyllabic brother, if only I weren't super busy this evening.
617005 [to Big McIntosh] I guess guys' night will just be you and me.
6170db A guys' night? You mean a rowdy evening of reckless revelry? Zoot suits, fedoras, swing dancing?
617005 Eh, something like that. [nervous] You should totally come. Three of us would be way better than two...
6170db That does sound fun, actually...
617005 Too bad you're busy.
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Well, I suppose I could squeeze you in if I move a few very important ponies around.
617000 [click]
6170db [gravelly accent] June, honey, be a dear. Reschedule Luna and Cay-Cay. [normal, aside] That's what I call Princess Celestia, what a hoot! [gravelly accent] In fact, clear the whole evening. Tonight is guys' night. These fellas invited me to spice things up and bring a little class to the whole affair.
617000 [magic zap]
617000 [rumble]
6170db [normal voice] Tonight will be the best night of your lives, and not just because you get to bask in my greatness.
617005 I do like basking in things. See you tonight. [hushed] Twilight's castle. The fun starts promptly at sundown.
6170db Technically, the fun starts when I arrive, but I'll make sure it's around sunset. Adieu, fellas.
617000 [magic zap]
617005 And... we have sundown. Repeat, we have sundown. I declare tonight's guys' night ceremonies officially open!
617026 Eeyup!
617005 It's guys' night.
617026 Yup.
617005 Oh, yeah.
617026 Yup.
617005 Havin' fun now.
617026 Yup.
617005 Oh, yeah!
617026 Oh, yeah!
617000 [fanfare]
617005 What the hay?
617000 [cartoon skedaddling]
617367 [high-pitched] Announcing the much anticipated arrival of the spirit of chaos and disharmony, the purveyor of pandemonium, lord of lawlessness, earl of turmoil, bringer of bedlam... [imitating fanfare] Discord!
617000 [electronic music playing]
617000 [confetti exploding]
617000 [magic zap]
6170db So, shall we hop to it? I made a list of the rowdiest establishments in Ponyville. It's rather short.
617005 Actually, we're staying here. I hope you like awesome games!
6170db Games? I love games. I'm great at games.
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Famous pony charades? Oh, this is an easy one. Who am I? Huh? Huh?
617000 [beat]
6170db Oh, come on!
617005 Uh... I'm talkin' about a real game.
6170db Oh, you mean like trapping best friend ponies in hedge mazes and turning them against each other. Those were the days.
617000 [Celestia's mane yowls]
617000 [magic zap]
617005 Not exactly. Wait here.
617000 [beat]
6170db Whatever it is, it can only get better by adding me to the mix.
617005 [off-screen] Okay!
617000 [click]
617005 In a world where evil reigns supreme, a small band of warriors stands tall against the darkness. This is... Ogres & Oubliettes!
6170db [gasps]
6170db Oh, this looks like...
617005 The best game ever? You're right!
6170db Yes...
617005 Ogres & Oubliettes is a fantasy role-playing adventure game. Our goal, defeat the evil Squid Wizard, or... [stifling laughter] as we call him... the Squizard!
617026 [stifled laughter]
617000 [beat]
617005 [chuckling] [clears throat] The Squizard has laid siege to the last free city in Spiketopia. That's the name of the land. He's kidnapped a beautiful unicorn princess named Shmarity. [beat] Uh, which is like a normal name in Spiketopia, so, you know, don't think about it too much.
6170db Fear not. Your romantic delusions are safe with me.
617000 [zip!]
617005 First things first – you've gotta create a character! Name?
6170db How about... Discord?
617005 [sighs] The whole point of the game is you get to use your imagination to be someone you're not. I'm Garbunkle, a famous magician. Everyone treats me with the utmost respect.
6170db Just like in real life?
617000 [crack]
617005 And don't get jealous, but I'm a level 30 Enchanter with major skill points assigned to Intellect and Perception.
617000 [hairdryer running]
6170db [not listening] Go on, I'm listening.
617005 Big Mac's character is Sir McBiggun, a level 27 Black Knight Unicorn from Castle Chadwick!
6170db [still not listening] I'm listening.
617005 When his king aligned himself with the Squizard, Sir McBiggun would not besmirch his honor.
617026 Nnope!
6170db [clears throat] [mumbling] I'm listening.
617005 And so it came to pass, the magician and black knight vowed to rid Spiketopia of the evil Squizard.
617000 [balloon deflating]
617005 So, your character's name?
6170db I already have the best name in the universe. Why would I change it for something like "Captain Wuzz"?
617005 Captain Wuzz it is!
6170db [groans]
617005 What class are you, Captain Wuzz? There's Archers, Mages, Rogues...
6170db [snorts] Can I suggest we take a break and, I don't know, go out and have some fun? Ponyville's not going to paint itself red.
617005 You'll love it once we get started! [rolls die] How 'bout an Archer?
6170db Sounds just as miserable as the other options. So fine.
617000 [tok]
617005 Sir McBiggun, are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
617026 Eeyup.
617005 Discord, or should I say, Captain Wuzz, are you—
6170db Oh, get on with it.
617005 [rolls dice] We find ourselves trapped in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked tight.
617000 [beat]
617005 The bars exist in our imagination.
6170db Really? You describe things, and then we pretend it's real?
617005 It is real. In our imagination. It's your turn first. What do you wanna do?
6170db Curse myself for attending this infernal evening? Ohhh, no, you mean in the game.
617005 Well, you can do whatever you want. Then, I roll this twenty-sided die and see if you're successful.
617000 [clang]
6170db I stick my head through the bars and demand for the immediate release of the Lord of Chaos.
617005 That's a big risk. You have to roll a seventeen or higher to succeed. [rolls die] Ooh, bad idea. The guard gets mad.
6170db This spell here. I transform him into a parsnip.
617005 You need eleven Intelligent points to cast a Transform Into Root Vegetable spell.
6170db I'm not intelligent? I cast it anyway because this game is stupid.
617000 [thud]
617005 [rolls die] The spell backfires. So [stifling laughter] your claws grow leaves and transform into parsnips!
617026 [chuckling] Parsnips. [laughs]
6170db [growls]
617005 The guard laughs. He calls his friends over, and they laugh too.
617368 [laughing]
6170db Don't you laugh at me, Big Mac! Does it really say that? Let me see.
617026 [laughing]
617005 [rolls die] [laughs] As you get angrier, everypony laughs harder!
6170db I seal Sir McBiggun in a magic bubble until he stops laughing!
617005 I told you, you can't do magic!
617368 [laughing]
617000 [magic zap]
617026 Whoaa! Nope! Nope! Nope!
6170db "Not intelligent enough." Please.
617005 Cut it out, Discord!
6170db Oh, this game is insufferable! Let me show you a real guys' night!
617000 [snap]
617000 [upbeat jazz]
6170db [laughing] This is the life! Jazz, dancing, the best table magic can buy! This is what guys' night is all about. Am I right, fellas?
617026 Eeyup!
617005 I know you probably didn't do this on purpose, but this table's the perfect size and shape!
6170db I don't think so. Let's have a drink. Chocolate milkshakes?
617005 [sighs] No, we want to go back to Ogres &—
6170db Oh, how 'bout a different game? [magic zap] Those are very bad cards.
617005 Stop messing with us! We wanna—
617000 [magic zap]
6170db A dance contest?
617000 [upbeat jazz BGM]
6170db Surprise! We won!
617005 Discord!
6170db [sinister] Yes?
617005 Look, we don't wanna do these things. We wanna play our game. If you don't want to play with us, you can, I don't know, sit and watch.
6170db Sit and watch? Fine. We'll play your game. [reverberating] Are you ready to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
617000 [magic zap]
617005 Sir McBiggun?!
617026 Eeyup!
617005 And I'm... Garbunkle? That means... Sweetness! We're in the game! Check it out! Ka-zam!
617000 [magic zaps]
617000 [shings]
617005 It's guys' night!
617026 Eeyup!
617005 Oh, yeah!
617026 Yup!
617005 In the game now!
617026 Yup!
617005 Oh, yeah!
617026 Oh, yeah!
617005 Discord, where are you? This is great! You made the game real!
6170db [reverberating] [laughs] Aren't games fun?
617005 Should we be worried he's using his scary voice?
617000 [army marching]
617369 Behold! I am the Squizard!
617368 [gasps]
6170db [reverberating] [chuckles] You're welcome.
617369 Attack!
617000 [army shouting]
617005 Run!
617368 [panting]
617000 [arrows being fired]
6170db [reverberating] You find yourself on the battlefield. A barrage of arrows rains down on you. If you roll a fifteen or higher, the shield protects you. Fourteen or lower and, well... [laughs] You get the idea.
617000 [thud]
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Seventeen! Lucky you!
617026 [grunts]
6170db Boo.
617368 [panting]
6170db Boo.
617368 [screaming]
617005 Discord!
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Sir McBiggun, I'd cover the entrance if I were you.
617000 [shing!]
617005 This isn't funny!
6170db Isn't this what every gamer wants? To live the game? Like this?!
617000 [magic zaps]
617000 [thud]
617005 Ugh!
617000 [army shouting]
617000 [thud]
617005 [groans] This kinda hurts! Like, real pain!
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Oh, how kind of you to notice. It's the little details that really bring alternate dimensions to life, wouldn't you say?
617005 Discord, this is awful!
617000 [magic zap]
617369 Of course it is! Spiketopia will be mine! And Rarity shall be my bride!
617000 [beat]
617369 I mean, Shmarity.
617000 [magic zap]
617368 [gibbering]
617000 [thud]
617005 Why are you doing this? You're the worst!
6170db If I'm the worst, then why did you invite me?
617005 Because we felt bad for you!
6170db Because you... what?!
617000 [snap]
617000 [magic zap]
617005 [panting] We're okay, we're okay! No thanks to you, Discord!
6170db You felt sorry for me?
617005 Who wouldn't? Fluttershy told us you practically begged her to stay! And then at the train station, you were just standing there, all alone!
6170db This can't be. I'm supposed to feel sorry for you because I'm me and you're you.
617005 [sighs] We only invited you to be nice! I mean, you're kind of a... weirdo!
617026 Eeyup.
6170db I ruined your night, and you don't even think I'm cool? Ugh. [zap] [muffled] How embarrassing. I should go. [normal] I have a lot of other friends I need to see tonight.
617005 Good!
6170db Yes, so many other friends. [whimpers] Farewell, Garbunkle the magician and brave Sir McBiggun. May providence smile upon thee in thy quest to rid Spiketopia of the dreaded Squizard... [sighs] When I say it that way, the game doesn't sound half bad.
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Oh, well.
617000 [magic zap]
617005 [sighs] It... it's better this way, right?
617026 Eeyup.
617005 Because... now he can't bother us, 'cause he's off somewhere by himself... all alone... with no friends.
617026 Yup.
617005 [sighs] [clears throat] [unenthusiastic] We find ourselves in the dungeon of the evil Squizard. The bars are locked, and... Ah, who am I kidding? We should give him another chance. [clears throat] Captain Wuzz? Can you hear me?
617000 [magic zap]
6170db Oh! You realized how amazing I am and that I make you cooler just by being around me?
617000 [beat]
6170db Uh... [stammering] No, no, actually, that's not what I meant to say... I'm... sssssss...
617005 What?
6170db I'm ssssssss—
617005 Can't hear you.
617026 Nope.
6170db I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?! I'm sorry for ruining your game, and I'm sorry that I thought I was better than you! [pants] [quickly] Now let's play before this evening gets any sappier, shall we?
617000 [magic zap]
617026 [unintelligible whispering]
617005 Huh? Yeah, yeah! Okay! What if we forgot the board and the pieces for a minute? I mean, the whole game coming to life was completely terrifying, but also kind of the best thing ever! So, uh, Big Mac and I were wondering... What if you toned it down just a teensy bit?
617000 [Mane Six chattering]
617000 [doors open]
617012 Huh?
617000 [army shouting]
617005 I've got your back, Captain Wuzz!
617000 [magic zap]
617026 Wha-hah!
6170db [grunts]
61736a [panting]
617369 [evil laughter]
6170db [accented] Garbunkle! Follow my lead!
617000 [magic zap]
617369 [squeaks]
617000 [crunch]
617005 Bull's-eye!
6170db Nice one!
61736b It's guys' night!
617026 Eeyup!
61736b Oh, yeah!
617026 Eeyup!
61736b Having fun now!
617026 Eeyup!
61736b Oh, yeah!
617026 Oh, yeah!
617003 We should just close the door and let them finish... whatever this... is.
61700c No way! Did you see Big Mac's sword? I totally want in!
617007 Yeah! I don't know what it is, but it looks like super duper fun!
617030 Guys' night!
617000 [credits]
618000 [birds chirping]
618008 [hocks, spits]
618000 [wind whistling]
618000 [thunk]
618000 [slow motion sounds]
61800c Hey, Applejack! Whatcha doin'?
618008 Whoa! Oof! Ugh! Well, I was practicin' my distance buckin'.
61800c Uh, distance bucking? What for?
618008 Because Cousin Braeburn and the rest of the Apple family in Appleloosa seem to think that their team can beat Ponyville at buckball.
618000 [thunk, smack]
618000 [thud]
61800c What?! Ha! That's ridiculous! Nopony beats Ponyville! I mean, I could beat the whole town of Appleloosa at buckball with one wing tied behind my back!
618000 [thunk]
618008 [grunts]
61800c [grunts]
618008 [grunts]
618000 [crash]
618008 So I can count on ya to join the Ponyville buckball team?
61800c Oh, yeah! I am so there! I've just got one question.
618008 Hmm?
61800c Uh... what's buckball?
618008 [groans]
618000 [theme song]
61800c So, basically, buckball is the coolest game ever. Offense, defense, teamwork, nonstop action! It's got it all!
61800e Wow, Rainbow Dash. You sure seem to know a lot about this game. I've never even heard of... buckball.
61800c Yeah, I'm kind of an expert.
618008 Hmph. An expert who hadn't heard of the game either until I told you.
61800c Well, it's a new game. I probably know more than most ponies, so that makes me an expert.
618007 I don't know anything about it at all. But it sounds like there's a ball and bucking, so I'm betting it's super duper fun!
618008 The point is, my cousin Braeburn somehow convinced a Pegasus and a unicorn to come play with him on the Appleloosa team, and he can't stop braggin' about how his team is gonna beat ours!
61800e But, um, we don't have a team.
61800c Well, between Applejack and me, we've got two-thirds of a team. All we need is a unicorn. That's where you two come in.
618007 [whispering loudly to Fluttershy] Uh... they know we're not unicorns, right?
61800c Uh, obviously. You're gonna be on my team, and Fluttershy is gonna be on Applejack's team.
618008 We'll play against each other along with whatever unicorns want to try out until we find the best one.
618007 Ohhhh! Phew! That's a relief because I left my unicorn costume at home!
618008 I know a lot of you are here because I told you what an amazin' game buckball is. And even though it's already an Apple family favorite, most o' you probably don't know anything about it. So I thought we'd give you a quick demonstration. The two Earth ponies are on offense. They meet in the middle of the field for the buckoff. They both try to be the first one to kick it.
618000 [ball bounces]
618008 [grunts]
61800c And the Pegasus is on defense. She tries to keep the ball from going in the goal and passes it back to the Earth pony on her team. Just give it a little kick, Pinkie.
618007 Yaah!
61800e Aah!
618000 [thud]
618007 Ohhh. I get it.
618008 And all the unicorns have to do is float these here baskets around the outside of the field and catch as many balls as possible for their team. [to Pinkie and Fluttershy] You two get the idea?
618007 Absolutely!
61800e Oh, I don't know. That ball moves pretty fast.
61800c All right. Now let's see which of you has what it takes.
61836c Um, what do I do?
61800c When the ball comes towards you, catch it.
618009 [blows whistle]
618008 Okay, just try your best, Pinkie. I have been doin' this a lot longer than you.
618007 [grunts] Aah!
618008 [dazzled] Nice kick.
61800e Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Whee! [giggles]
618008 Great save, Fluttershy!
61836d [gasps]
61800c Coming your way, Pinkie!
618007 Somersault kick!
61836c [whimpers]
618000 [thud]
618007 Hey, this game is easy!
61800e Ooh! [giggles] It actually is kinda fun!
618008 Where did Pinkie Pie learn to buck like that?
61800c And Fluttershy's spinning tail catch is pretty amazing.
618008 Um... okay. Well, let's see what the rest of you can do.
618008 Now, don't expect to be able to beat me twice in a row.
618007 [grunts]
61800e Well, hello there, Mr Ball. Whee!
618008 [grunts]
61800c Hiya!
61800e Hurry along, butterflies, before that ball comes and hits you.
618104 Aah!
618000 [whoosh]
618008 Nope. Um... okay. Let's see what the rest of you can do.
618000 [bonk!]
61800c Nope.
618008 Definitely not.
618000 [whirl!]
618350 [gags]
61800c No.
618008 Not a chance.
61800c No.
618008 Nope.
61800c Aaaand... no.
61800c [groans] This didn't go how I thought it would.
618007 Whee! [giggles, grunts] Yeah! Ha! [giggles] Whee! Ha ha!
618008 It sure didn't.
61800e This game is a whole lot more fun than I thought it would be.
618007 It's exactly as much fun as I thought it would be! A whole bunch!
618035 [Snails]
618035 Carryin' my water
618035 My water, my water
618035 Carryin' my water
618035 On my shoulder pole
618007 Snails! Look out!
618035 Hmm?
618000 [water splashing]
618008 Amazing!
618035 You should be more careful with these. You could lose them.
61800c Hey, Snails, can you float one of those baskets over here?
618035 Hmm? Sure. What do you want me to do with it?
618008 Catch!
618035 Anything else?
61800e Wow, Snails. You're a natural at buckball.
618007 It's a good thing, too. We were running out of unicorns.
61800e Do you think you'll be ready to play with Applejack and Rainbow Dash against the Appleloosa team?
618035 I guess I'll find out. Plus, after I deliver this water, I don't really have anything else to do.
61800c Well, Snails, with you on the team, Ponyville is one step closer to crushing Appleloosa!
618008 Huh. And after today, it's pretty clear who the other two players should be.
61800e W-What do you mean? I thought you and Dash were gonna play.
618007 Yeah! If you're not crushing Appleloosa, who is?
61800c [laughs] Uh, you two, obviously!
61800e Um, you want us to play buckball against Appleloosa instead of you?
61800c Mm-hmm.
618007 That's "uncredible"!
618000 [beat]
618007 Unbelievable and incredible? [scoffs] Come on!
618008 I can't explain it, but you two are really good at this game. And if it means beatin' Appleloosa, I'll give either one of you my spot on the team quicker than Granny Smith can core an apple.
61800c Me, too. I'd normally be so pumped all of Ponyville was counting on me to win, I'd run right over the competition. But you still flew rings around me.
61800e Oh, I'm sorry. I was just having fun.
618008 Well, you can have all the fun you want as long as it's while you're beatin' the hide off of Braeburn's team.
618007 I do like fun!
61800e Honestly, the game was a little scary at first, but once I got the hang of it, I had a pretty good time.
618007 Let's get this party started!
618008 All right. But if we really wanna beat Appleloosa, we're gonna have to get serious.
61800e Serious?
618007 Serious how?
618008 With serious practice!
61800e [gulps] Wow. This looks pretty intense.
61800c Well, duh! You two are gonna be representing all of Ponyville. And, more importantly, us!
618008 That's why, before we leave for Appleloosa tomorrow, you two are gonna practice just as hard as we would.
61800c So let's hop to it! Snails already has a head start on you!
618000 [balls bouncing]
61800c Okay, if you wanna win, you totally gotta get this drill down!
618000 [knees shaking]
61800e I-I-I do?
618000 [epic rock training montage music]
61800e [gasps, gasps loudly, gasps, whimpers]
618000 [brakes screech, music stops]
61800c It's all about ball control.
61800e [gasps] Whoa!
61800c Ready? Go! Come on! Faster! You don't want Ponyville to lose because you can't get into high gear, do you?!
61800e [gasps] Whoa! Ugh!
618008 All right. Bein' able to buck a ball into a goal from any direction is the most important thing in the game.
618007 Eh, if you say so.
618000 [bucks, thud]
618007 Whee! Whee! Whee! Whoopee! Woo-hoo! [grunts]
618000 [thud]
618007 Whee! Woo-hoo!
618000 [balls thudding]
618008 Keep it up! Just one miss'll ruin the Apple family's buckball reputation forever!
618007 Whoa! What?! [grunts]
618000 [bonk]
618007 Whoops.
618000 [epic rock training montage music]
61800c Come on! Push! Push! Push!
618000 [clang]
618000 [circling birdies]
618008 Come on, now! Every shot is for Sweet Apple Acres! And me! And Dash! And all of Ponyville!
618007 Whoa! Uhh! Ow.
61800c Faster!
61800e Whoa!
618008 Come on now!
618007 Wh-Wh-Whoa!
61800c Come on!
61800e Aah! [gasps]
618008 Keep it up!
618007 Whoa!
61800c Come on!
618000 [bonking]
61800e [gasps]
618008 What in the apple happened to those two?
61800c I don't know. They mopped the field with us before.
61836e [grunting]
618008 All right! That's it for today, y'all!
61836e Phew!
618007 I thought practice was supposed to make us better.
61800e Maybe we just need a little rest.
61800c Or a whole lot of it.
618008 Just be sure to get your heads in the game before tomorrow. All of Ponyville is countin' on a win.
61800e I really don't want to let Applejack and Rainbow Dash down, or anypony else, but after that practice, I'm not feeling very confident.
618007 Maybe we weren't that bad!
61800e [groans]
618007 I guess I was hoping you saw something I didn't.
61800e I know our friends want us to win, but how can the whole town be counting on us if most ponies have never even heard of buckball?
618007 I know! How can we disappoint a pony who doesn't even know we have a team?
61800e Or that we're gonna play Appleloosa?
618007 Pfft. Yeah. I don't think we need to worry. I'd be surprised if anypony in this town cares about this game at all.
6180ec Go, Ponyville! Go, Ponyville! Win, win, win! [background cheering] Woo-hoo! Ponyville! Way to go!
618035 Whoa. The whole town really seems to care about this game a lot.
61836e [gasps]
618000 [train puffs]
618000 [crowd cheering]
61800c Heh. We kinda went around town and talked up the team a little.
618008 Yup! We wanted to make sure you two knew that all of Ponyville was behind you!
618007 [nervous] Greaaaaat...
618008 I hear the whole town's already plannin' a parade for when you get back after whuppin' Appleloosa! That should feel pretty good!
61800e [nervous] It should...?
61800c Totally! Just spend the whole ride to Appleloosa thinking about everypony cheering for the victorious Ponyville buckball team! [gasps] I bet Princess Celestia even comes to congratulate you! If that doesn't get you in "the zone", I don't know what will!
61800e I don't know what zone Rainbow Dash is talking about, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be in it. Do you?
61800c Hey! You two are supposed to be in the zone!
618007 [squeaks] You see... the thing is... thinking about everypony... thinking about us...! Aah! There's just no way to...!
61800e There's no way that we can get in the zone, because the zone sounds like a horrible place since we are terrible at buckball and we are going to lose and let everypony down and we don't want to play anymore!
618007 [bawling]
618035 I'm still okay with playing, in case you were worried.
618000 [general background chatter]
61800c I don't get it. They're naturals! Why wouldn't they want to play anymore?
618008 Maybe us telling them how much everypony was countin' on them messed them up somehow.
61800c What?! That's crazy talk! Having ponies depend on you is exactly what you need to focus! And—
618008 Get serious and play hard and—
61800c Get ready to totally smash the competition, and— and... none of that sounds like Pinkie or Fluttershy, does it?
618008 [sighs] Guess not. We got so wrapped up in what's important to us, we went and ruined what was fun about the game for them.
61800c [groans] What do we do now?
618000 [knocking]
618000 [door opens]
61800c Pinkie? Fluttershy?
618008 We know you're in here! We've looked in every other car on the train!
61800e [muffled] Maybe you need to look again!
618007 [muffled] Yeah! Because... we're totally not in here!
61800e [muffled] And we're definitely not in here if you're gonna try and make us play against Appleloosa!
618007 Or anypony else!
618008 [clears throat]
61800e Oh... we're sorry to let you down. But it's better to do it now than during the game against Appleloosa.
61800c You don't have to play against Appleloosa.
61800e We don't?
618008 Nope. We're gonna take your place. So you don't have to worry about that at all.
618007 [sighs] Why didn't you say so?
61800c But... we can't take on Braeburn and his team without any practice. So we need you to play just one more time.
618008 Against us.
618008 Now I know we mixed up the teams before, but since Dash and I really need the practice, we'll play against the two of you.
61800e Oh, I don't know how much practice you'll get against us. We've been playing just awful.
61800c Don't worry about it. Applejack and I just need a little workout.
618008 Yup. You two just do your best.
618007 I can do that!
618000 [whoosh]
618007 [nervous whimper]
618000 [whoosh]
61800e [nervous whimper]
618007 [gasps]
618008 Ahem.
61800e [grunts] Huh!
618007 Ooh! [grunts]
61800e Looks like you two really do need practice!
618000 [various whooshes]
618000 [various thunks]
618007 Hee-hee! Ha! Whee!
618035 [snoring]
61800e [giggling] If you need more practice, we can keep going.
618007 Yeah! I could do this all day!
61800c [panting] No, thanks. Playing against you two is just as humiliating now as it was when we weren't trying to show you how awesome you are.
618007 Wait... what?
618035 Finally!
618000 [thunk]
618008 You must've noticed how you aren't bad anymore.
618007 Oh, yeah! Weird!
61800e But, um, why were we so terrible before?
61800c I guess some ponies thrive on pressure and some ponies don't. And even though we weren't playing, we were treating you like us, which totally stressed you out.
618008 And that just sucked the fun right out of the game for you.
61800c And having fun is what makes you really, really, really good!
61800e But being good doesn't matter if we're too afraid of letting ponies down.
618007 Yeah! What about all those ponies back in Ponyville counting on us to win?
618008 I'm sure folks want you to win, but not if worrying about it makes you miserable. Winning's never worth that.
61800e But how do we keep from worrying about it?
618035 You could do what I do and not think about it. Seriously. I don't think about anything. Ever.
618007 Hm. Works for me!
618000 [crowd cheers]
618124 And with another bouncing goal from Pinkie Pie, the score is tied!
61800c You guys are amazing!
618007 [panting] Braeburn is really good!
61800e So is that Pegasus. Oh, I don't know if we can win.
618035 You know what I would do?
618007 Not think about it?
618035 Not think a— [beat] Oh, yeah. That.
618008 Ha. And as long as you're havin' fun, it doesn't matter if you win or not.
6180d5 [blows whistle]
618007 [giggles] I think it's more fun this way!
618000 [thwack]
618124 And Pinkie wins the buckoff! But her shot's rejected! Back to Braeburn, whose kick's stopped by another Fluttershy save! Next point wins. Lots of tense back and forth here. Fluttershy unleashes her patented spin move, but Braeburn's there to— No! It's Pinkie with a somersault kick! What a move! And that's the game! Ponyville wins!
6180ec [chanting] Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville! Ponyville!
618008 Huh. Looks like you three made quite an impression!
61809c Well, cousin, I have to admit. Your Ponyville team played a pretty good game.
61800c Hah! Good game? We bucked the hooves right off of you!
61809c Yup, you sure as shootin' did. I'm gonna have to get real serious about a strategy for our rematch.
61800e Oh, I wouldn't get too serious.
618007 Yeah! Everypony knows the secret to good buckball is just having fun!
61836f [laughing]
618000 [credits]
619000 [sand throwing and splatting]
619066 So Scootaloo's keeping Petunia busy like you asked. What did you two want to talk about?
619370 I'm sure you get these questions all the time. Oh, this is so awkward.
619371 Um, you're the experts, so we thought you'd have some insight into our daughter's new, uh, cutie mark.
61900a What's wrong?
619370 Obviously, we're both very proud of her and her cutie mark...
619371 Despite its, um... unsettling nature.
619066 Unsettling?
619000 [sand shuffling]
61900a I don't get what you mean.
619370 Her mark doesn't... bother you at all?
619065 Hey! Check out what we found!
619372 Look! A spiny-backed ponysaurus! In our own backyard! And I found him on my very own! How cool is that?!
619373 Oh! [chuckles] She's an archaeologist.
619065 Of course! What'd you think she was gonna be, a pirate?
619000 [beat]
619370 Pirate? Pfft! Why would we think that?
619373 [laughing nervously]
619000 [theme song]
619065 Woo-hoo! Another successful cutie intervention! You know, Crusaders, I don't wanna toot our own horn, but we've helped a lot of ponies figure out their purpose in life. Like Bluenote here. Nice saxophone, Bluenote!
619000 [saxophone playing]
61900a Yep, everywhere you look, there's a pony we've helped find a purpose.
619000 [tap dancing]
61900a You've gotta admit. We've had a pretty good effect on everypony since we've discovered our destiny.
619065 And started helping other ponies discover theirs! Could this get any better or what?
619066 Now, Scootaloo, you do know there will always be challenges? Someday, somepony might even come to us with a problem that even we can't handle. Like, say...
61900a A griffon?
619066 Ha! Exactly! Like a griffon. But that's just crazy talk.
619065 Or not!
619066 Is that really a griffon?
61900a You're darn tootin' it is! What do you think that griffon wants?
619066 I guess we've gotta ask her, but aren't griffons supposed to be kind of mean and cranky?
619065 Crusaders, looks like we've gotta step carefully.
619374 The Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it's really, really you! [laughs]
619065 [strained voice] Aah! Ooh! This... griffon's... not... cranky.
61900a How in the blooming apples did you know who we are?
619374 Know who you are? Know who you are?! Why, I've heard about you from everypony in Ponyville! I'm so excited to meet you, I could just explode! I'm Gabriella, but you can call me Gabby since we're friends now! Pleased to meet ya!
619080 [groaning shakily]
61900a Well, howdy... um... Gabby.
619374 [squeals] I'm just about the most excited anygriffon has ever been about anything!
619066 Excited? But whatever for?
619374 What for? What for?! Everypony in town tells me of your amazing assistance! How you help ponies find their place in the world!
619065 It's a calling, but—
619374 And that's why I'm here. I need help, too. I want you to give me a cutie mark!
61900a Um, can a griffon even get a cutie mark?
619065 I dunno, but I think we should probably find out.
619080 [chuckling nervously]
619065 So, Gabriella...
619374 Gabby, 'kay?
619065 Gabby, why do you even want a cutie mark?
619374 [slurping under]
619065 It doesn't seem like a very... griffon-y thing to want.
619374 Right? Right?! Right?!
619000 [thud]
619374 You're tellin' me! I don't know if you've heard, but griffons can be a little bit... unfriendly.
619374 [voiceover] Most griffons don't pay much attention to each other. And if they do, it's not, y'know, the good kind of attention. As for me, I'm just a little mail delivery griffon who likes to spread a little bit of griffon-y sunshine on my rounds, which always makes me feel different from the other griffons.
619000 [doors slamming]
619374 [voiceover] I'd do anything for any old griffon in need.
619375 Ahh! Uhh!
619374 [voiceover] But it just always seemed like the harder I tried, the less I fit in. It wasn't until your friends came to Griffonstone that I realized some creatures actually like helping each other, and I saw something so awesomely awesome – how helping spreads from pony to pony and griffon to griffon! I knew then that I had to find out why I was so different from the other griffons, and I knew the answer just had to have something to do with those wonderful, amazing marks on the ponies' flanks. And I admit, hehe, I became, um, maybe a little obsessed. So first chance I had to deliver a letter from Gilda, I took it, so I could find the perfect pony to help me understand what those marks are. Everypony here told me one thing – I just had to see the Cutie Mark Crusaders! They've helped everypony here get their cutie marks, and I knew, I just knew, that someday I'd have one, too! A cutie mark of my very own!
619374 That's why I flew all the way here! I want to find my own place in the world, and I know you can help me by giving me a cutie mark! So let's make with the cutie! [giggles] Whenever you're ready. Did it happen yet?
619066 Uh, not exactly.
619374 Howboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnowhowboutnow?
61900a Um, Gabby, I hate to break it to ya, but it sounds like you might've heard some tall tales about what Crusaders can do.
619065 I mean, we are kinda awesome and all, but nopony can just give you a cutie mark. It just sort of... happens.
619066 Though I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen to griffons. Or if it does, we've never ever heard of it.
619374 Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Sounds like a challenge! And who could be up to it but the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders? Cutie marks! It's in your name and everything, right? Right?! Right?! Now I have to deliver Gilda's letter to Rainbow Dash. I bet by the time I get back, you'll have it one hundred percent figured out! Toodles for now! Whee-hee-hee! Gonna get my cutie mark!
619066 What she wants... It's not possible, right?
619065 I don't know. But I know someone who just might.
619003 I've read every book on the subject, and I've never read a thing about any creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark.
619065 But, Twilight, Gabby flew all the way here so we could help her. There's gotta be something we can do.
619066 Say, is there some kind of spell you can whip up to make her mark appear?
619003 Um, I don't know if any of you remember, but using magic to get a cutie mark never really works out all that well.
619080 Ohhh. Right.
619003 Crusaders, I'm sorry. While I can't say for certain that it's utterly impossible, the chances of Gabby getting an actual mark are... pretty slim. Everything I've ever learned tells me. It's just not gonna happen.
61900a Oh, no! Poor Gabby! What the apples are we ever gonna tell her?
619066 Crusaders, this is terrible! Gabby really believed in us. And now, we're gonna let her down.
61900a But what else can we do?
619065 Hmm. You know what, Crusaders? So what? Maybe we can't help Gabby get a cutie mark, but we can still do what we're best at. We can help her find her purpose!
61900a And I reckon doing that is the same for griffons as it is for ponies or any other creature in Equestria.
619065 All we have to do is be extra-special clear with her. Like, Crystal Empire clear.
619080 Yeah!
619374 Incoming!
619000 [thud]
619080 [straining]
619374 Hiya, you wonderful, wonderful Crusaders! I just know you've figured out how to help me because you're all so incredible!
619065 Well, Gabby, we've talked it over, and we think we may just be able to help you out. But not exactly in the way you think. See, here's the thing about you getting a cutie mark—
619374 I'm getting a cutie mark!!! Woo-hoo-hoo! [yelling excitedly]
619065 Wait! You didn't let me finish!
619066 Um, I think maybe that could've been clearer.
619374 [rhythmically] Cutie mark! Cutie mark! Gonna get my cutie mark! [yelling excitedly]
619066 She's still going. Anypony know if griffons ever get tired?
619374 What do you think my mark will be? A lightning bolt? An erupting volcano? I don't care if it's a jar of marmalade! I know I'll love it, whatever it is!
61900a Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby. There's somethin' we need to clear up. We can definitely help you find your purpose, but that mark's probably not gonna happen.
619374 What?!?
619065 It's true. Twilight's never heard of a creature other than a pony getting a cutie mark.
619374 Oh! [laughs] Is that all? You had me worried for a second. I-I mean, there's a first time for everything, right? And she didn't say it was impossible, right?
61900a Well, not exactly.
619374 Well, then if anypony can make it happen, it's you three. I mean, you haven't failed yet.
619065 You know what, Gabby? I promise we're gonna do everything we can to help you get your mark.
619374 Oh! It's gonna happen! I can feel it! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! [laughs]
619066 Aaaaand... she's off again.
61900a Why in tarnation would you promise somethin' that just can't be done?
619065 I know what it's like to want something that's out of reach. And just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it can't. Maybe trying for the impossible isn't so bad.
619066 Guess we'll never know for sure unless we give it a try.
61900a All right, but where do we even start?
619065 Where we always do – with a good old-fashioned Crusaders chart.
61900a The first thing we gotta do is find your purpose.
619065 Nopony gets a mark without one.
619374 All right. Let's do this.
619065 What are you good at? Do you play any sports?
61900a Or like to dance?
619066 Or how about singing? I just love to sing! La-la-la-la!
619374 Wow! I kinda wanna just try everything! I mean, I don't even know what to pick!
619065 Don't worry. That's what we're here for.
619066 [Sweetie Belle]
619066 Like a racer at the starting line
619066 You're chomping at the bit
619065 [Scootaloo]
619065 You are here to find your purpose
619065 And a place you really fit
61900a [Apple Bloom]
61900a And until you find your place in life
61900a You're never gonna quit
619080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
619080 We can help you find the purpose in your life
619374 [Gabby]
619374 A griffon mixes lion's strength
619374 With winged eagle's might
619374 When I finally find my purpose
619374 Then my cutie mark's in sight
619374 Crusaders, I won't let you down
619374 I've just begun to fight
619374 You're gonna help me find the purpose in my life
619374 Got a job that's just no fun?
619374 Call on me, I'll get it done
619374 Cauldron's stuck and needs a mix?
619374 I'm the one who's got the fix
619374 Help you teach pre-calculus
619374 Scrub the floors, won't make a fuss
619374 Clearing kelp? Just give a yelp
619374 Raring to go, ready to help!
619080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
619080 That's the spirit
619080 You ought to see what you do best
619080 Try it all, pick your fave
619080 And leave behind the rest
619374 [Gabby]
619374 I'll try anything
619374 To get my cutie mark
619374 Keep up with me, Crusaders
619374 We're just getting our start
619374 Rock your little ones to sleep
619374 While hanging up the sheets
619374 I can help you with your heavy load
619374 Walk Granny 'cross the street
619374 I'll run you 'round the bases fast
619374 It's really no big feat
619080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
619080 Can we help her find the purpose in her life?
619374 [Gabby]
619374 Cheer you if you're feeling low
619374 Plant your garden, make it grow
619374 Write a piece for your quartet
619374 Filling in on clarinet
619374 Bake that cake as fast as lightning
619080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
619080 She's so good at things, it's frightening
619080 Cutie Mark Crusaders,
619080 I think we've got a problem!
619374 [Gabby]
619374 Build a boat
619374 And sail it out across the sea
619374 Need some help?
619374 You know that you can count on me
619374 CMCs, you're gonna help me find my purpose
619374 The purpose in my life!
619374 In my life!
61900a Now how we gonna do this?
619066 Gabby's special purpose can't be everything, right?
61900a It may as well be. I don't know how we find what she's supposed to do when she can do it all.
619065 [sighs] And if finding her purpose seems impossible, we can just forget about the whole griffon-getting-a-cutie-mark thing, which is actually impossible. I never should've gotten her hopes up!
619374 I did... it... all! So, lay it on me, Crusaders. What's my purpose? And how do we get a mark on these here haunches?
619065 Gabby, we... we don't.
619374 Wait. What are you saying?
61900a We're sayin' that since you can do everything so amazingly well...
619066 We just can't figure out what one thing you're supposed to do.
619065 Gabby, we can't help you.
619374 But, but... you're the world-famous Cutie Mark Crusaders! I can't believe it! I... I... I won't believe it!
61900a Gabby, wait!
619065 We're sorry! We're so, so sorry! This is just awful. For the first time ever, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are cutie mark failures.
619065 I'm sorry, Crusaders. I really thought we could help Gabby.
619066 I thought we could help anypony.
61900a Maybe that's just it – maybe we can only help ponies.
619065 Or maybe we just plain failed.
619000 [door opens]
619374 Failed? Then what do you call this?!
619080 A cutie mark?!
619066 What? You got your mark after all! Even though we couldn't find your purpose? But– What? Huh?! How?!
61900a And what does it mean? A cauldron?
619374 Uh... I don't know. Maybe it means my purpose is, uh, helping Zecora with potions. That was the first thing I tried. I guess it just took some time to appear. But here it is!
619065 This is awesome! We're not failures! Whatever we did worked! I had a feeling we could help you, and we did!
61900a Oh! We've gotta go see Twilight right away! She'll wanna know about this!
619066 Correction – she needs to know about this! I bet she'll want to write a whole book about the very first griffon to get a cutie mark of her own!
619374 Oh, uh, totally! Um, but, you know, Rainbow Dash asked me to pick up her answer to Gilda's letter. I better take care of that before I forget. Heh. Here's an idea. Uh, y-you head to the castle, and I'll meet you there, cutie mark and all! Um... toodles!
619000 [whoosh]
619065 Wow! Can you believe it? We were able to help her get her mark after all! Come on, Crusaders, let's tell Twilight!
619003 Gabby? You just missed her. She was in such a hurry, she didn't even come in. Just dropped this letter and zoomed away!
619065 [reading] "Dear Crusaders, I'll never forget you. You really are every bit as awesome as I'd heard. I'm heading home to tell all the griffons how you did the impossible by getting me my cutie mark. Toodles."
619000 [books thudding]
619003 Wait a second. Cutie mark?
619000 [teleportation zap]
619003 You actually got a griffon a cutie mark for the first time in recorded history?! You know what this calls for? A full-scale research project!
619066 This makes no sense. Gabby didn't come in and show you her mark?
619003 You have got to get Gabby back here right away! I have so many questions! Oh, I hope I have enough ink and parchment to document everything! Spike! Guess what just happened!
61900a Weird. Gabby didn't show Twilight her mark like she said she was gonna do? Somethin' in this here applesauce smells kinda fishy.
619065 We'd better find her and find out what's going on. Come on, Crusaders.
619065 Keep your eyes on the skies, ponies. Gabby can't have gone far.
61900a She's not in the air. She's right there! Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!
619374 Um... Sorry, no time to chat. I-I just stopped to help this pony get out of the muck, and then I really gotta fly. Okay? Heave-ho! [grunts]
619000 [splat]
619066 Gabby, we're your friends. Why in Equestria are you running away from us?
619374 Running away? Oh, I'm not running away. I'm just, uh, e-excited to show my lovely new cutie mark to everyone in Griffonstone!
61900a You mean the cutie mark that's runnin' right off your flank?
619374 [defeated] Yup... That's the one. I guess the one thing I'm really not good at is faking things.
619065 Wow, Gabby. Painting on a fake cutie mark to make yourself feel better? You must have been really upset.
619374 Sure, I was disappointed. But I didn't do it to make myself feel better. I wanted to make you feel better.
619080 [gasp]
619374 I couldn't bear you three thinking you failed after you tried so hard to help. That's why I had to leave before you or Twilight found out the truth. [sighs] I'm sorry I wasn't honest with you. I'll just wing my way back to Griffonstone. Thanks for trying.
61900a You don't need to apologize for carin' about how other ponies are feelin'.
619066 I'm just sorry we couldn't come through for you.
619065 Hmmm... Maybe we can. Gabby, clean up and meet us at the Crusaders' clubhouse!
619000 [door opens]
619374 I know you all tried your very best, but I guess griffons and cutie marks just don't mix. Maybe... I don't even have a special purpose.
619065 Hang on a second. We were racking our brains trying to figure out your destiny, until we remembered how every time you did something new, you tried to help everypony around you.
619066 Even us. How did it feel when you showed up with that fake mark, and the three of us thought we'd actually helped you?
619374 Well... I was really glad I helped you feel happier.
619065 So maybe helping is your thing! You might even say it's your purpose!
619374 But helping just feels good. I-It couldn't have anything to do with what I'm supposed to do with my life... right?
619065 Gabby, finding your special purpose doesn't have to be about being good at something. It's about feeling good about something inside.
61900a And it looks like your destiny is a whole lot like ours – helping others. And you don't need a symbol on your flank to know that.
619066 But since we are the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we made you one anyway. Behold!
619080 Your very own cutie mark! Ta-da!
619065 We carved it to mark the moment we all figured out what you should do with your life.
619374 But they look just like yours. You can't mean...! [gasps]
619065 You bet we do! You're one of us now! Gabby, today we dub thee...
619080 The very first griffon member of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! Woo-hoo!
619066 You may not be able to get a cutie mark...
61900a But you're selflessly dedicatin' your life to helpin' others anyhow. I can't think of anything more Crusader-y than that.
619374 Awesome! My very own cute-ceañera!
619000 [chatter in background]
61900a Oh, land sakes! You sure have earned it.
619066 And so have we! Scootaloo, you're pretty amazing. Even though things looked bleak, you still found a way to help Gabby in the end.
619065 'Course! Helping's what we do, right?
619374 [laughing] I am so grateful! I'm gonna go home and do my very, very best to bring Cutie Mark Crusader values to Griffonstone! I promise.
619065 Promise us one other thing, too?
619080 Come back soon!
619065 After all, you're a Crusader now. Crusaders forever?
619374 Crusaders forever!
619000 [credits]
620008 The map is sendin' us where?!
62000e Las Pegasus?!
620008 But Las Pegasus is a wild vacation spot! It's just one big party!
62000e All those lights and sounds, not to mention the crowds... Oh, just the thought of it is overwhelming!
620003 I know Las Pegasus doesn't seem like either of your cups of tea, but I have total faith you wouldn't have been called unless you were the perfect ponies for the job.
620008 Probably not as bad as we think. It can't just be a loud, obnoxious party all the time... right?
620000 [pop]
62000e Uh, Applejack? It isn't as bad as we thought.
620000 [crowds cheering]
620008 You're right. It's worse!
620000 [theme song]
620134 [gasp]
620000 [general chatter]
62000e Do you think the map could be on the fritz again? I mean, this place seems a lot more suited to Pinkie Pie or even Rainbow Dash.
620008 If Twilight trusts the map, then so do I. All we have to do is solve our friendship problem and get back home. 'Course, we have to find it first.
620376 And make sure to experience our signature show, Pone Fantastique! Trust me when I say you've never seen anything like it! Unparalleled acrobatics! Unique animal antics! Your only regret will be that you didn't see it sooner! And like everything at this amazing, incredible, I-can't-believe-it-even-exists hotel, Pone Fantastique is brought to you by the chairpony of kindness – Gladmane himself!
620000 [crowd gasping]
62000e Wow. This Gladmane sure seems impressive.
620377 Well, uh, it is a little embarrassing, but the crowds seem to like it. Uh-huh-huh.
620008 Mr Gladmane?
620377 Just Gladmane'll do. And it's a pleasure to meet actual cohorts of the Princess of Friendship! Thank you for coming. Thank you very much.
62000e You know who we are?
620377 I'm what you might call a friendship connoisseur, so naturally I'm familiar with the friends of the great Twilight Sparkle! Applejack, Fluttershy, it's an honor to have you here. Uh-huh-huh.
620008 I have to admit you're not the type of pony I expected to find in Las Pegasus.
620377 [laughs] Well, my guests may be looking for lights, music, and parties, but working hard and making friends is how I turned this hotel into what it is today, and how I plan to make it even bigger. Uh-huh-huh! Uh, excuse me for a second. [inhales] [through loudspeaker] Wise ponies may say the folks that come here are customers, but I can't help but thinkin' of each and every one of you as friends. That's why there's a three-for-one special on apple fritters in the cafe for the next hour! Enjoy! Uh-huh-huh!
620000 [crowd chattering]
620377 Would you two like to take a tour of the place? I'm just about to do my rounds and check on my friends who work here.
62000e [hushed] We do have a friendship problem to find.
620008 Lead the way, Mr Gladmane!
620377 Just Gladmane now, you hear?
620378 [gasps] Gladmane, you're just in time to see my newest move!
620377 New moves or not, I'm glad to have a star like you working for me, I'll tell you what.
620378 Oh, don't make me blush! Now watch this!
620377 Stellar! Uh-huh-huh!
620379 Oh! Oh! Monsieur Gladmane himself is here! Let's run through the whole routine!
620377 Now, don't make a fuss for ol' me. I'm just gonna keep on giving a tour to my new friends Applejack and Fluttershy.
620008 Howdy!
62000e Hi.
620379 If zis pony calls you friend, you're welcome backstage anytime! I owe him my entire career.
620377 Aw, shucks. Well, let's leave the artists to their work.
620008 [hushed] Doesn't look like there's any friendship problems here.
62000e [gasps] I've never seen a pink prairie dog before!
620000 [prairie dog squeaking]
620377 I like the folks that come here to have a unique experience. Uh-huh-huh.
62037a Und we love him for it!
62037b With Gladmane's help, we've been able to take care of all these little guys!
62000e Now this place is overwhelming in a good way!
620377 Aw, glad you like it.
620008 [clears throat] Fluttershy?
62000e Hmm? Oh, um, coming!
62000e There doesn't seem to be anything wrong around here at all.
620008 I figured lookin' for a friendship problem in Las Pegasus would be like tryin' to find a needle in a stack of needles. But everypony seems to be gettin' along just fine.
620146 Ladies and gentleponies, despite what my competition might say, I know you've come to this fair city to be entertained, and I assure you there is nothing more entertaining than the astounding acrobatics in Gladmane's Pone Fantastique!
620145 Now, I suppose that might be true if it weren't for the existence, and far superiorly entertaining presence, of the show-stopping exotic animal act that Pone Fantastique includes!
62000e Those voices sound familiar.
620008 They sure do. Flim and Flam.
620146 Why, I won't even dignify that assertion with a response! Except to say that if you were to consider buying your tickets from me, I might consider offering them to you at a substantial discount!
620145 But I've always thought you get what you pay for, and in my humble opinion, these tickets are a value at twice the price!
620146 Don't let this price-gouging charlatan take you for a ride!
620145 [gasps] Charlatan? How dare you!
620146 Hah! How dare I?!
620145 [simultaneous] Yes, how dare you! I was the one that...
620146 [simultaneous] I call 'em likes I see them, dear brother of mine!
620145 [simultaneous, background] I'm two minutes older than you – don't you forget that, brother of mine!
620146 [simultaneous, background] I'm sick and tired of this...
620147 [further unintelligible arguing]
62000e They certainly don't seem to be getting along. [gasps] You don't suppose we've been brought here to help them?
620008 Absolutely not!
620147 [arguing]
62000e I know you and the rest of the Apple family have had your issues with Flim and Flam in the past, but they're definitely having trouble, and solving a friendship problem is important, no matter who's having it.
620008 Well, of course that's true... for anypony but them!
620377 I'm sorry you had to see that. I don't know why, but those two have been fightin' ever since they got here. I thought giving them these jobs might help, but I... I guess it just made matters worse.
620008 Trust me. I know those ponies, and you're better off with them apart. The two of them together will cheat the hooves right out from under you!
620377 Yeah, I suppose you're right. Flim's such a showpony, and Flam has such a head for business. Why, if they ever did work together, they'd be running this place in two shakes! Ah, speaking of which, I'd better get back to work. Y'all enjoy your stay now, you hear?
62000e I'm pretty sure we should help Flim and Flam...
620008 And I'm pretty sure there's another friendship problem here, and I'm gonna search this resort top to bottom 'til I find it!
62000e [sighs]
620146 I hope you didn't travel all the way from Ponyville to try to get me to reconcile with my no-account brother.
620145 Brother? I don't believe I have one of those.
620146 No! I already know what he thinks of me! All show and no substance! Well, if he's so smart, he should have no trouble becoming a big success on his own!
620145 "Ooh, why, he's the greatest salespony that ever lived, of course!" Just ask him. He'll tell you all about it.
62000e I'm sure you could work out your differences if you just sat down and talked to each other.
620147 I'm never speaking to that pony again!
62000e [sighs]
620000 [general casino chatter and noises]
620379 [muffled] No! [normal] You are ruining my show!
620378 It isn't just your show, and I'm improving it.
620379 You don't pull a rabbit out of a hat on the trapeze!
620378 That's the point – to give the audience something they've never seen before! Acrobatic magic!
620000 [twirling]
62037c Ta-da!
620378 It's called "blending genres", and it's awesome!
620008 Shouldn't somepony do somethin'?
62037d Hah. They've been doing this since they started working here. Too bad, really. If they ever stopped shouting at each other, we could take the show on tour. They'd be way more successful than staying at Gladmane's.
620008 Heh-heh. Now that sounds like a real friendship problem!
62037a Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
62037b Stop! What are you doing?! It's supposed to be a pink prairie dog pyramid! It's alliterative!
62037a Wha— You said a tower! Why do you keep changing everything?
620000 [prairie dogs squeaking]
62037b I'm not changing anything! You said pyramid!
62037a [shrieks] You are driving me crazy!
620008 I thought you two got along.
62037b We used to, but we just can't seem to agree on anything anymore. We used to perform all over Equestria, but if we can't agree on a new act, we might as well stay at Gladmane's forever. [stomping]
620008 Two friendship problems in the same theater? Now we're talkin'!
62000e If you count Flim and Flam, that's three big friendship problems all in the same place!
620008 Well, I don't count Flim and Flam since those two not bein' friends isn't a problem.
62000e It certainly isn't for Gladmane. Sounds like he's better off with them fighting.
620008 Actually, the other ponies' problems seemed to be good for Gladmane too. Both the trapeze show and the animal act would be better off if they left, but everypony's so busy arguin' that they can't.
62000e Do you think he knows?
620008 I don't know, but I'm startin' to think we should find out.
620378 Of course Gladmane wants everypony to get along. He's the nicest, most genuine pony I've ever met. Did the director put you up to this?
62037c [unintelligible whispering]
620379 I tell you, if Gladmane is your friend, you are welcome backstage. But if you are speaking of him poorly, you leave!
62037a Gladmane is the kindest, most gentle...
62037b ...most compassionate pony I've ever known!
62037e My problem... is with him!
620000 [prairie dogs squeaking]
620008 I just can't figure it! The only pony who benefits from all this feudin' is Gladmane, but by all accounts, he's the best friend any of these ponies have!
62000e Well, Bernard – that adorable bunny from the acrobat's act – claims that every morning, Gladmane tells the director that the star wants control of the show, and every afternoon tells the star that the director wants to get rid of her! But neither is true!
620008 [snorts]
62000e And the Flying Prairinos – the pink prairie dog family – say Gladmane keeps changing their act to make each trainer think the other is doing it!
620008 So all his talk about friendship is just a load of applesauce! He's gettin' them all to fight with each other on purpose!
62000e But how can we get everypony to believe that's what he's doing?
620008 There must be a way to trick him into telling the truth!
62000e Gee, if only there was a pony who knew how to trick a trickster.
620147 [unintelligible arguing]
62000e Or maybe a pair of ponies?
620008 [sighs] Fine. Guess bringin' Flim and Flam back together might be why we're here. Maybe.
620146 Sorry if I don't take the word of somepony off the street, even if that street is in Ponyville.
62000e But Gladmane is behind so many other friendship problems. How can you be sure he isn't the cause of yours?
620145 Because the only problem I have is standing right there.
620146 Same here, buster!
620008 Do either of you even know what you're fightin' over?
620146 Gladmane let me know that ex-brother of mine thinks I'm just a mouthpiece without a single good idea!
620145 Gladmane assured me this former fraternal foal here thinks I couldn't sell heat lamps to yaks!
620008 Sounds to me like neither of you said those things. Why'd you believe Gladmane when he said you did?
620146 Why would he lie?
62000e Because he's afraid that the two of you together could move in and take over his resort.
620008 And if I'm tellin' you he said it, you know it's the absolute truth because—
620147 You never lie!
620145 Oh, brother of mine, I think it's time for a little payback!
620146 The Canterlot Two-Step?
620145 Mmm, we don't have the chickens. How about the Baltimare Flare?
620146 Ah, my flare isn't what it used to be.
620377 [over loudspeaker] Listen here, y'all! If you're a friend of mine, you're entitled to a free night's stay, and everypony is a friend of mine! Thank you. Thank you very much.
620146 Are you thinking what I am?
620145 The High Roller Hustle!
620008 The what now?
620145 Trust us. When we're done, there won't be a pony in town who doesn't know the Applejack-iest truth about Gladmane! That is, assuming you two are willing to help.
620146 What size gown do you wear?
620000 [crowd chattering and cameras clicking]
620377 Wh-What's all the fuss, now?
620146 It's the grand matriarch of the Rich family, Impossibly Rich! She's one of the wealthiest ponies in Equestria.
620377 Well, why didn't somepony tell me? You know how I like to give VIP guests my personal touch.
620146 Well, she's not exactly a guest. Word is she's planning a resort of her own. [hushed] I think she's here to scout the competition.
620377 [hushed] Oh, really?
620146 And with her bits, she could take over the whole strip, hire away anypony she wants!
620377 [growling]
620146 Uh, not me, of course! I love it here. My good-for-nothing brother, on the other hoof...
620377 [snorts] Impossibly Rich, what an honor it is to have you at my humble five-hoof resort. I'm sure Flam has done an excellent job showing you around, but nothing could beat a personalized tour from the mane himself. Uh-huh-huh.
62000e [unintelligible whispering]
620145 You'll have to excuse Ms. Rich. She saves the energy other ponies spend talking out loud and uses it to make more money.
62000e [unintelligible whispering]
620145 She'd love a personal tour! Say, in, uh, about an hour?
620377 Well, that sounds right pleasant. And if you can break away for a moment, Flam, I'd love to see you in my office so I can get ready.
620000 [curtain rustling]
62000e Are all of you sure this is a good idea?
620146 Abso-tively!
620145 Gladmane is one fish that's hooked but good!
620008 I sure hope you two know what you're doin'.
620145 Oho, don't you worry. When it comes to throwing ponies off their game...
620146 No two ponies do it better than us!
620008 Can't argue with that.
620000 [door opens]
620145 Hey there, boss, Impossibly Rich is just about ready for that tour. So what did you want to see me about?
620377 Actually, there's something I want you to see – the Grand Plan. Every hotel on this strip as amazing as this one, and every one of 'em mine.
620145 [whistles]
620377 And all it'll take is a little salesponyship, like this.
620000 [click]
620377 [over loudspeaker] Hey there, friends. Uh-huh-huh. If you think my resort is fantastic, wait 'til you see Pone Fantastique! Tickets are on sale now. Two for the price of one! Thank you. Thank you very much.
620000 [click]
620377 Now I know Impossibly Rich has probably made you a tempting offer to come work for her.
620145 Well uh, now that you mention it...
620377 And as your friend, I'd never tell you what to do. But nopony's gonna stand in the way of my plans, no matter how rich she is! And I sure wouldn't want you to end up on the losing side. Think you might consider staying here?
620145 Um...
620377 Well all right then.
620008 They're comin'!
620377 And last but not least, Ms. Rich, the jewel in my crown.
62000e [unintelligible whispering]
620145 Impossibly wants you to know she's very impressed but doesn't think you can keep a resort of this caliber going for long.
620377 Oh? And why's that?
62000e [unintelligible whispering]
620145 Because you've got the best talents in the industry. What stops them from just leaving to join any competitor?
620377 [laughs] Well, you see I have a trick for that, I must confess. Uh-huh-huh. And it all has to do [also over loudspeaker] with how I handle my employees.
620145 And how is that?
620377 [also over loudspeaker] Well, like friends, of course! And I treat every one of my employees with the kindness they deserve.
620145 [stammering] That's it? That's your secret, heh-heh? There's... [clears throat] ...nothing else?
620377 Nope, just friendship. But you know all about friendship, don't you... Fluttershy?!
620146 You knew the whole time?
620377 Never try to con a con-pony. Uh-huh-huh. [laughs] Yeah!
620000 [bits jingling]
620000 [door opens]
620377 I'd have thought you'd have hit the road by now.
62000e Whether we were able to fool you or not, you can't just go on keeping ponies from getting along! It's just... mean!
620377 Now, maybe it is. But it's a meanness that works. Unlike your pathetic little ploy. I practically invented the "High Roller Hustle". But I suppose I should be impressed. You're the only ponies to ever figure out the secret to my success. Takes a lot of work keepin' everypony fightin'. But as long as I keep 'em convinced that I'm their only friend, all of Las Pegasus will be mine. Oh, you can't trick a confession out of a pony like me! I'm always one step ahead.
620008 Well, you better check your hooves, because you've just stepped in a confession!
620377 Oh, no. No, no, w-w-wait, wait!
62000e [over loudspeaker] Did that sound okay?
620147 Never better!
620008 [over loudspeaker] Flim and Flam told us you'd see right through the fake rich pony bit, and that once you did, you wouldn't be able to resist gloatin' about it! This was all part of the plan!
620377 Oh, now, now, friends! Listen, I-I can explain everything!
620379 I think you've done enough of that! Darling?
620378 Hmph!
62037a Oh, I cannot believe we let him almost ruin our friendship!
62037b And our act. Good luck finding another one!
620377 Wait! No! Y'all come back! Come on, I-I'm gonna be ruined! This is Gladmane's, y'all! Come on, you can't do this to... [wailing trails off]
620008 Gladmane has left the buildin'!
620000 [crunching, crash]
62000e I guess the map wasn't on the fritz after all.
620000 [cutie marks ringing]
62000e If it weren't for your history with Flim and Flam, you never would've been so determined to find somepony else to help, and we never would have found out what Gladmane was doing.
620008 And if it weren't for you wantin' to show even those two con-ponies kindness, we never would have been able to trick the trickster. [to Flim and Flam] Must've felt pretty nice to finally put all your connivin' and cheatin' skills to good use.
620145 In fact, we might think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
620146 Emphasis on "once".
62000e [suspiciously] What do you mean?
620145 [over loudspeaker] While this establishment undergoes a slight change in management, my brother and I want to assure you that it remains the pinnacle of Las Pegasus entertainment! Which is why we invite each and every one of you to experience the wonder of the Pone Fantastique Theater – at half the normal cost of admission!
620146 [over loudspeaker] And while you're appreciating this historic venue totally devoid of any performers of any kind, we invite you to use the wonder of your own imaginations to fill the space at no additional charge!
620000 [crowd excited chattering]
620008 Flim and Flam!
620000 [credits]
621000 [doors open]
62127c [yawns]
621003 [yawns] I've prepared a full day of spells. You've been doing great, but now it's time for a real challenge!
62127c Oh-ho-ho! It is on! Where do we begin?
621003 Teleportation! Multiple locations! Try to keep up!
621000 [teleportation zaps]
621003 Transfiguration!
621000 [zap]
621000 [chick chirping]
621000 [zaps]
62127c [blows]
621003 Shields!
621000 [zaps]
621000 [explosion]
62127c Whoo! I am on fire! What's next?
621003 Maybe there is such a thing as too much studying.
621000 [crash]
621000 [theme song]
62127c As you know, speed spells like Accelero are not easy. But if done correctly, they can allow you to be much more efficient with your day.
621000 [whooshing]
621005 Way to go, Starlight!
62127c [laughing] I'm not finished. I've discovered a very old spell, Similo Duplexis, when combined with Accelero in just the right way... [doubled up] ...you can literally be in two places at once! [normal] [sighs] Now I'm finished.
621003 I have to admit, your skills with magic really are nothing short of amazing. I'm very impressed.
62127c [laughing] I've always been something of a natural.
621003 However, it doesn't look like you've tackled any friendship lessons since you met Trixie.
62127c Are you sure? I could've sworn there were a couple in there somewhere...
621003 I'm sure.
62127c I see... Well, I'm really quite busy this week. So many commitments. I'll try and find some time in my—
621000 [magic zap]
621003 No time like the present! Spike and I are headed to Canterlot. Princess Celestia wanted me to give her students a quick overview on the history of enchanted objects in Equestria. We'll be back after the presentation, which should be...
621005 Twenty moons from now?
621003 Tonight. It's a quick presentation.
621005 [to himself] Sure, keep telling yourself that...
621003 You can tackle a friendship lesson today, and we can review your progress when I get back later this evening.
62127c [nervously] Of course! No problem! Friendship lesson... On it...
621003 Great! Can't wait. Now, Spike, help me color-code these cards according to time, place, and object.
621005 [sighs]
621000 [knocking]
621000 [clicking]
621000 [door opens]
62127c Huh? Huh! [humming and muttering to self] Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
621005 Hey! Twilight and I are about to head to Canterlot. Just checking to see if you need anything before we left.
62127c Nope, not at all! I'm good here. Oh, not good – great! Not a problem in the world! Heh.
621005 [disbelieving] Uh-huh. So... what are you doing, exactly?
62127c I... was... just trying to decide which friendship lesson I was going to tackle while you two were in Canterlot. Bap-ba-du... Oh, yep, right here, where I just left them a second ago.
621005 [blows] [reading] "Bake a cake with Pinkie Pie," "scrapbook with Applejack," "sew with Rarity..."
62127c [groans]
621005 "Help an animal with Fluttershy," "chillax with Rainbow Dash?" What is chillaxing?
62127c No idea.
621005 You know, uh, if you're nervous about your friendship lessons, it's totally okay to say so.
62127c Nervous, me? [fake laughter] Oh, Spike, you really are hilarious, ha-ha. You think I'm nervous that I'm gonna fail something as simple as baking a cake?
621005 Well, if you were, it'd be—
62127c Silly! Twilight just said how impressed she was that I combined a speed spell and a duplication spell. That was a challenge. These? Pfft, hah! I could combine all five of these at the same time without breaking a sweat.
621005 I think maybe you're missing—
62127c An opportunity to really impress Twilight? [gasps] Great idea, Spike! I'm gonna get right on that! Good talk.
621005 And I thought Twilight was the master of the freak-out.
62127c So, with your help, I figure these should be done in no time.
621008 Are you sure this is what Twilight would want? Seems like you might want to take your time with each of these.
62127c But by working as a team, we can get them done faster. And isn't teamwork a key factor in friendship?
621008 I... guess.
62127c Super! Pinkie Pie, since we're baking, you will be in the kitchen.
621007 [inhales]
62127c Rarity, Applejack, you two can set up in the library.
62100d Oh, I don't know that a dusty old library has the proper lighting. Perhaps we can stay out here in the foyer.
62127c I thought that Fluttershy and I could work with the animals right here in the foyer.
62100e Oh, um, whatever you think is best.
62127c Great. Now, Rainbow Dash—
62100e It might depend on the animal. For instance, this poor little eagle with a sprained wing might be better off up in one of the towers.
62127c Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
62100e And these adorable little chipmunks might prefer a nook somewhere. Maybe if you spend some time getting to know—
62127c In a minute, Fluttershy.
62100c Uh, I don't know if we can chillax properly in the castle. We need very specific conditions for optimal chillaxing.
62127c Oh, I just assumed chillaxing could happen anywhere.
62100c Heh. Shows what you know about chillaxing. Let me do some location scouting.
621000 [whoosh]
62127c Okay... It seemed more efficient to start with the scrapbooking, so we can just get it out of the—
621007 Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we start with me? We're gonna need time for the cake to bake! After all...
621007 It's a piece of cake to bake a pretty cake—
62127c Uh, we're on a schedule, no time for a song. We can start with baking, then—
62100d But we can't design dresses after you've been baking with Pinkie. [hushed] She can be a bit messy.
621000 [squidge]
621007 Mmm!
62127c Fine. We can start with the dresses, and then—
621008 While y'all figure that out, I'm gonna start layin' out the pictures for scrapbookin'. We got a whole lot of time to cover.
62127c How much is a whole lot?
621008 We've got at least eighty moons worth of memories to go through.
62127c Eighty moons?!
62100c Ugh. There is nowhere to chillax in this castle! We're gonna have to set up somewhere else.
621018 [overlapped argument]
62127c Could you all excuse me for... one... second?
621000 [whoosh]
62100c Wow. That pony really needs to chillax.
621000 [door opens]
62127c [hyperventilating] Okay, Starlight. You've got this. A handful of friendship lessons is nothing compared to the spells you've mastered. [nervous laugh] Maybe if I cast a little spell to help things along... Something simple and safe. Fiducia Compelus... That's not bad. They would barely notice it, but... is it enough? Oh... Maybe Cogeria so they're more... open to suggestion. Oh, or maybe Cogeria combined with Fiducia Compelus! Yes, that could work nicely! Oh, with a hint of Persuadere to be sure it sticks.
621000 [magic zap]
62127c Everypony'll probably thank me for getting it all done so quickly. And Twilight will be thrilled I've completed so many lessons. Everypony wins!
621000 [magic zap]
62127c Congratulations, Starlight. You're a genius. [gasps] Maybe the congratulations were a little premature...
62127c Cogeria... Persuadere... Fiducia... Hmm. Ah! Of course! Fiducia Compelus needs a trigger. [amplified] Ponies! Hear my voice and listen!
621000 [magic zap]
62127c Pinkie, kitchen. Rarity, Applejack, library. Fluttershy, stay here. Rainbow Dash, find somewhere inside the castle and set up a place where we can chillax.
621048 [overlapped agreement]
621000 [door opens]
62127c Let's get to work, Pinkie!
621007 [mechanically] Okie-dokie! What would you like to do first?
62127c Uh, what are we supposed to do first?
621007 [mechanically] Whatever you want to do first, Starlight Glimmer.
62127c [reading] In a medium-size mixing bowl, beat together eggs, sugar, and two teaspoons of vanilla... [beat] mix in flour... [beat] [quickly] add baking soda, salt and cinnamon! Hmm. I think you can take it from here.
621007 [mechanically] Take what from where?
62127c The baking. Just keep following the instructions in the book until I get back.
621007 [mechanically] Abso-tively! Instruction following starting... now!
62127c Baking a cake – check! Now on to sewing!
621000 [door closes]
62127c What did you have in mind, Rarity?
62100d [mechanically] Whatever you want me to have in my mind, Starlight Glimmer.
62127c Can you make a dress exactly like that one?
62100d [mechanically] Just like this one?
62127c Just like it.
62100d [mechanically] Absolutely. It will look perfectly divine.
62127c That's a whole lot of photos. How do you usually organize them?
621008 [mechanically] However you want me to organize them, Starlight.
62127c Okay. Tell me about this one.
621008 [mechanically] Sweet Apple Acres, twenty moons ago. Granny Smith was lookin' for her favorite pie tin. She looked in the kitchen, but it wasn't there. She looked in the barn, but it wasn't there.
62127c Ugh. I don't need every little detail. Heh. Just sum up the story in one sentence.
621008 [mechanically] Huh. Turns out Granny Smith didn't know how to make a pig do the backstroke.
62127c Uh-huh... Why don't you keep putting these photos in chronological order, and when I come back, you can give me more... highlights?
621008 [mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer.
62127c Fluttershy, where are all the animals?
62100e [mechanically] They ran away.
62127c And why didn't you stop them?
62100e [mechanically] Because you didn't ask me to.
62127c Obviously I wanted you to... Never mind. Can you please round up all the animals in the castle and bring them back here to the foyer?
62100e [mechanically] All the animals. Got it.
62127c Did you find a place to chillax, Rainbow Dash?
62100c [mechanically] Sure thing, Starlight Glimmer!
62127c Great. Let me know when it's ready.
62100c [mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer.
621008 [mechanically] Granny Smith knew she was gonna need a bigger boat, so Goldie Delicious says, "If you can't say anythin' nice about anypony, come sit by me!" Big Mac knew if he just covered himself in mud, the creature wouldn't be able to see him!
62100d [mechanically] Starlight Glimmer. I have finished the dress. Isn't it gorgeous?
62127c What is that?
62100d [mechanically] You wanted me to make a dress exactly like the one in the book.
62127c [sighs] Go make a real dress out of fabric, exactly like the one in the book.
62100d [mechanically] Ah. I see. Yes, of course, Starlight Glimmer.
621000 [beat]
62127c Rarity! Make it bigger than the one in the book.
62100d [mechanically] Of course, darling. Bigger it is.
621000 [mouse squeaks]
621008 [mechanically] She was just a pony standin' in front of another pony askin' him to love her.
621000 [door opens]
621000 [crash]
62127c Pinkie, what are you doing?!
621007 [mechanically] Following all of the instructions in the cookbook in order, Starlight Glimmer!
62127c I meant just the one cake! I was only gone a few minutes! How in Equestria did you get all of this done so fast?
621007 [mechanically] First, I combined three eggs, then I— [muffled noises]
62127c Think the baking lesson is done.
6212f9 [growling]
62127c Oh, what now?
621000 [oven crackling]
621008 [mechanically] They can take our farm, but they can't take our freedom!
62127c What's going on?!
6212f9 [growls]
62100e [mechanically] I gathered all of the animals like you asked, Starlight Glimmer.
621000 [thud]
62100d [mechanically] Oh, yes, this will do nicely.
621000 [thud]
62100d [mechanically] A much bigger dress!
621008 [mechanically, muffled] It was the best of apples, it was the worst of apples...
62127c [exhales] I can handle this. It's just magic, and I know magic. What's that?!
621007 [muffled noises]
62127c What did you say?
621007 [mechanically] The cakes are burning. You left the ovens on.
62127c We need water!
62100c [mechanically] Yes, Starlight Glimmer.
62127c Storm clouds?!
621000 [thunder rolling]
6212f9 [confused noise]
621000 [splashing]
621008 [mechanically] Big Mac told me, "With a whole lot of power comes a heck of a lot of responsibility."
62127c [groans] This can't get any worse!
621003 What is going on?!
621000 [spider squeaks]
621000 [brushing]
621005 I had no idea we had spiders in the castle! I'm never sleeping again!
62127c Maybe if I had reversed the Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria... Or maybe I added too much Persuadere... What?
621005 You're really missing the point here.
621003 [sighs] I finally untangled that mess of a spell and got everypony home. It was really powerful stuff. They're gonna feel that in the morning. Now please try to explain to me how in the name of Celestia things got this out of control.
62127c Well, it was the first time I cast that particular spell, and I didn't fully think it through. I-I bet if I had reversed—
621003 I think you might be missing the point here.
621005 Told ya.
621003 What made you think that casting a spell on your friends to do your bidding was even remotely a good idea?
62127c Well, when you put it that way, it sounds really bad.
621003 That's because it is really bad!
62127c [stammering]
621003 Starlight, I'm not mad at you, but I am disappointed. You've been doing so well. I just don't understand how a friendship lesson turned into all of this.
62127c Ugh, fine! I've been avoiding the friendship lessons on purpose.
621003 Why?
62127c I can cast complex spells, but baking a cake with Pinkie Pie freaks me out! And yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds. That's why I didn't say anything. I thought if I just kept wowing you with my magical abilities, you might just... not... notice?
621003 Baking a cake freaks you out?
62127c Yes! Baking a cake, sewing – all of it! What if I was bad at it? I didn't want to be a disappointment to anypony, and I ended up being a disappointment to everypony.
621003 Starlight, do you think anypony cares if you can bake a cake?
62127c But the lesson—
621003 Was to get to know Pinkie Pie better by doing something she loves. It was a friendship lesson, not a baking lesson.
62127c Oh. You know, I think I might have missed the point here.
621005 Told ya.
62127c So now what?
621003 Now it's time for a pretty advanced friendship lesson. It's called apologizing.
621008 [groaning] I don't know what kind of whammy Starlight put on us, but I feel like I got shoved through the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000.
62100c Ugh, tell me about it.
62100d [hushed] If everypony could speak in a whisper for the next few days, that would be delightful. My head is thumping...!
62100e [tired] I was up all night calming the animals down.
62100d [hushed] Fluttershy, please! Not so loud...
621007 Starlight's spell made me burn perfectly good cake! I never burn cake!
62127c Yeah, about that... Things got a little out of hand last night.
621008 Well, ain't that the understatement of the day.
621007 Hmph! Tell it to the cake, sister!
62100d [hushed] Can we all please argue at a lower volume?
62127c I really messed up. I cast the spell because I was nervous about working with you on the friendship lessons.
62100c Well, here's a friendship lesson for ya — don't cast spells on your friends!
62127c Believe me, I know. What I did was wrong, a-and I can't take it back. You're right to be upset, and I hope one day I can make it up to you. But all I can say is... I'm sorry. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go clean the castle covered in wet cake batter and spiders.
62100c That was a pretty good apology.
62100e Seems like she feels pretty bad.
621008 Hey, Starlight! Most of the Apple family photos are still layin' around in the wreckage. I think I'll come along and hunt 'em down.
62100e Oh, and I feel awful for disturbing all of those cute little spiders and bats. I should check on them.
62100d Ah, yes, and I left some lovely fabric out. I should come and move it to that nice quiet library.
62100c Uh, I'll come and get those storm clouds out of the bathroom.
621007 Fine! Somepony has to bake a cake to honor all the poor cakes that sacrificed their batter in last night's tragedy!
621000 [montage music]
621003 It seems your apology went well.
62127c [sighs] I'm just lucky to have such understanding friends, but it's probably going to be a while before I try to tackle those friendship lessons again.
621003 What do you mean? You've been doing them all day.
62127c What are you talking about? I've been cleaning up the mess I made by totally failing at friendship.
621003 Really? But didn't I see you sewing with Rarity?
62127c Yes, but—
621003 And you and Applejack did a great job collecting those photos and putting them in the book. Helping animals with Fluttershy, baking with Pinkie Pie – those sound like your assignments to me. In fact, I think there's just one that you're missing.
62127c Sun – check. Chairs – check. And thanks to a simple Catadupa Levitata spell, we've got water. Is that everything we need to chillax?
62100c Nope.
62127c No? What did I miss?
62100c Quiet.
62127c Ah! Right.
621003 Great job, Starlight. Looks like you've completed another friendship lesson. [sighs]
62100c Hey! She completes the lesson when I say she completes it. So less learning and more chillaxing!
621000 [beat]
62127c So... How long do we sit quietly?
621012 [laughing]
621000 [credits]
622000 [birds chirping]
622005 [panting] Twilight, can you slow down a bit? [sighs]
622003 Sorry, Spike. It's just Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack are getting back from their Seaward Shoals boat trip, and I can't wait to hear all about it! It's such a shame Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy had to miss it for their Cloudsdale flight school reunion. Maybe the rest of us not going was for the best anyway. I know the three of them were really looking forward to getting out of their element.
622005 Getting out of their element?
622003 I think they all just wanted to try something new.
622005 Huh. I guess a boat trip qualifies as that.
622003 My only worry is that they'll be so excited, they'll talk over each other, and I'll miss some of the details! Just to be safe, I may need you to take notes.
622000 [train chuffing]
622005 Uh... right.
622000 [train brakes hiss]
622003 So how was the trip?
622041 [grunting]
622005 Well, at least you don't have to worry about them talking over each other.
622000 [theme song]
622003 I don't know what happened on that boat trip. But once Rarity, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie have some tea and talk it out, I'm sure everypony will feel better.
622000 [splash]
622005 [snap]
622000 [knocking]
622003 Come on in, everypony! Gummy, Opalescence, and Winona? This is a surprise!
622005 Aren't Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Applejack with you?
62206a [purring]
622003 [reading] "Sorry, darling, but I must decline the invitation to your soiree. While I'm sure it will be positively resplendent, there are certain ponies I'd rather not associate with at the moment. Rarity."
622005 Rarity's not coming? Awww. So I polished my scales for nothing.
622003 [reading] "Sorry I can't make it, but I'm still a mite upset about everything that happened on the boat. Applejack." "Sorry I can't make the tea party today, but there's a small problem with the guest list. Plus, I'm right in the middle of a very important cupcake. Pinkie." Come on, Spike! Since our friends won't come here and tell us what happened, we'll just have to go to them!
622005 Right behind you! [stuffing his mouth]
622000 [brushing]
62200d [gasps]
622000 [crab snapping]
62200d I'm sorry, but my mane wasn't made to support marine life! Ruined, completely ruined.
622003 I don't know, Rarity. Maybe you could—
62200d Throw it away? Yes, I agree. Just another innocent casualty of that disastrous boat trip.
622003 About that. Spike and I were wondering what happened out there.
62200d Please, darling. I don't know if I'll ever be able to discuss it. It's far too painful! [gasps dramatically]
622005 If it's too difficult to talk about, we completely understand.
62200d Well, since you dragged it out of me... It all started at the docks. I knew Applejack and Pinkie Pie wanted to get out of their element, so I thought I would surprise them with an elegant cruise.
62200d [narrating] I had brought a small bag with just a few key essentials. [in-world] All right, ponies! Prepare yourselves for luxury on the high seas!
622007 That sounds... fun?
622008 [sea dog accent] The sea air carries a portent for trouble this day. 'Tis a treacherous and perilous journey that lies ahead of us! We sail to adventure... or our very doom.
62200d I... have no idea what you just said, but your wardrobe is delightfully seaworthy.
62200d [narrating] Despite Applejack's colorful seafarer attitude, I was still determined to get my friends out of their element by providing them with all the refinements of a luxury cruise. I made sure to bring the most delectable nibbles for them to enjoy.
622007 Ooh, I brought food too!
622000 [crash]
622007 Let's see, I've got cotton candy, taffy, circus peanuts, and lots of other super-yummy stuff!
62200d Oh, Pinkie Pie, that all looks positively delectable. But you simply must try one of these cucumber sandwiches. Dig in!
622007 Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
622008 [sea dog accent] Arrr! Get those off me ship!
622000 [splash]
622000 [bubbling]
62200d Oh! I'm so sorry! I had no idea you had such distaste for cucumbers!
622008 [sea dog accent] Yar-har-har-har, hardy-har-har-har!
622003 Hmm... That doesn't sound like Applejack.
622005 Huh.
62200d Well, hold on, because it gets even worse. Pinkie tried to lighten the mood with some fun maritime games.
622007 It's piñata o'clock! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?
62200d Oh, darling, of course!
622000 [lightning cracks]
622008 [laughs in sea dog accent] I'll be chartin' a course to the very heart of that maelstrom!
62200d Ahem. Er, Applejack? Just a thought, but maybe we should steer the ship toward calmer waters.
622008 [sea dog accent] This be the only way to Plunder Cove!
622000 [lightning cracks]
622000 [water rushing]
62200d Perhaps if I took a quick look-see at that map of yours, I could find us a more cruise-friendly path—
622008 [sea dog accent] Yah! There'll be no mutiny aboard me ship!
622007 Look at me! I'm the captain too!
62200d [narrating] Clearly, Pinkie Pie had caught Applejack's sea madness.
622041 [arguing]
622000 [splash]
622008 [sea dog accent] Is that all you've got?! [laughs]
622000 [splash]
622005 Then what happened?!
62200d Oh, the boat sank. Obviously. [blows]
622003 So Applejack got some sort of sea madness and caused the boat to capsize?
62200d After all the effort I put in to provide her and Pinkie with the exact luxury cruise they needed to get out of their elements, that is how Applejack thanked me!
622005 So you were stuck out in the middle of the ocean? How in Equestria did you get back?
62200d [sighs] Spike, darling, you'll have to forgive me. I am far too emotionally drained to discuss the matter any further!
622003 Rarity, I don't suppose there's any chance you might be... uh, exaggerating things? Just a little?
62200d Well! I can assure you that that is exactly what happened! But if you don't believe me, you can ask Pinkie Pie. I'm quite certain her story will be the same.
622007 So that's what Rarity said happened on the boat, huh?
622000 [slam]
622003 We thought there was a chance she might have... [clears throat] embellished the story just a tad. So we wanted to hear about what happened from you! Did Applejack really capsize the boat?
622007 Of course not! Pfft, that's just silly! There's no way Applejack could've sank the boat!
622003 I knew it!
622005 That's a relief.
622007 Because Rarity did!
622049 What?!
622007 It all started on the docks. I knew Rarity and Applejack wanted to get out of their element, so I figured I'd throw them the funnest, silliest boat party ever! But I guess Rarity had other ideas.
622007 [narrating] I thought I overpacked until I saw Rarity and her team of porter-ponies!
62200d Prepare yourselves for a luxury cruise! A day of opulence, decadence, and extravagance!
622007 [deadpan] That sounds fun.
622008 Ahoy, mateys! Batten down the hatches, y'all, 'cause this here's gonna be a boat ride of adventure!
622007 Eh, I can live with that.
622000 [beat]
622007 Huh. They just keep coming.
622007 [narrating] Now, you can't throw a silly boat party without snacks. So I made sure to pack the funnest party food I could find! [in-world] Rarity, would you care for some cotton candy? It's freshly spun!
62200d Oh, Pinkie Pie, those all look simply... well, simple. But they're obviously unfit for a luxury cruise. Now, my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof... Try one, then you'll understand.
622007 [chewing]
622008 Ooh, are those chocolate chip?
622000 [splash]
622000 [bubbling]
62200d Sorry! Cucumber sandwiches are so ten seconds ago.
622003 Wait, wait, wait. That doesn't sound like Rarity.
622007 Just wait until you hear how much more unlike her she sounds!
622005 [chewing]
622007 I thought I'd lighten the mood with some super-fun party boat games. But Rarity was a real wet blanket.
622007 It's piñata time! Ooh! Wanna give it a whack, Rarity?
62200d [exaggerated posh laugh] ...Oh. You were serious. Well, that's adorable.
622008 I'll give it a go!
622007 That's the spirit! Let's get this boat party started!
622000 [spinning]
622008 Whoooooa! Heh-heh! Whoa, doggie!
622000 [lightning cracks]
622000 [splashing]
622043 [grunting]
622007 Tug of war? Now we're talking! Whoever wins gets to be captain!
622041 [grunting]
622007 Or... one of us should just be captain now?
622000 [wheel rattling]
622000 [thud]
62200d Oh, don't worry, dear. Luxury cruises never sink.
622007 What?!
622000 [splash]
622007 And that's why the boat sinking was all Rarity's fault.
622003 That seems... odd. I mean, we trust you, of course. But it's all so... extraordinary?
622007 Oh, it's "extraordinary", all right. But that's exactly what happened! In fact, the only thing I might've gotten wrong was that there were even more porter ponies! But just to be safe, you should talk to Applejack. She'll know exactly how many porter ponies there were!
622005 Okay, but if the boat sank, how did you all get rescued?
622007 Oh, that's easy. We just— [sniffs] My muffins!
622005 [fed up] That's it. We've gotta go talk to Applejack.
622003 Good idea. She'll straighten this out.
622005 I just really, really wanna know how they made it back! But yeah, that'd be great too.
622000 [thwack]
622000 [apples falling]
622008 Hold on a tick. Pinkie Pie says it's Rarity's fault, and Rarity says I sank the boat? Well, that's plumb crazy! If you two really wanna know what happened, I'll tell you. Y'all know how Pinkie Pie and Rarity wanted to get out of their "element"? Well, I bought a treasure map to give 'em a rip-roarin' seafarin' adventure! But they had other ideas.
62200d La-la-la! Prepare yourselves for the most luxurious boat outing that ever outed a boat!
622007 And more fun than you can shake a stick at! [squee] Because I brought a stick!
622008 Alright, mateys, but just y'all wait 'til you see the high seas adventure I've got planned!
622000 [paper rolling]
622008 [narrating] Unfortunately, they seemed less interested in a treasure huntin' adventure and more interested in snacks.
62200d Oh, darling, that food isn't fit for a pony of proper breeding, darling, and refinement, darling! Now my cucumber sandwiches, on the other hoof...
622007 Bet you I can fit them all in my mouth! Ahh...
62200d Pinkie, darling, please!
622007 [chomping]
622008 [yelps]
622000 [thud]
622000 [splash]
622000 [bubbling]
622008 U-uh, Rarity, I—
62200d Well, I never! Hum-ph!
622007 Me neither! Hum-ph!
622003 Do you want to say it, or should I?
622005 I'll go. That sure doesn't sound like Rarity or Pinkie Pie!
622008 Oh, it gets a sight worse than that!
622007 It's P.W.T. – Piñata Whacking Time!
62200d Oh, darling, whacking is a base pastime for common ponies. Doesn't interest me in the least.
622007 Meh. Hee-hee!
622008 Huh?
622000 [spinning]
622008 Whoooooa!
622000 [lightning cracks]
622008 Looks like we need to change course!
62200d Ooh! Why, this will make a perfect tablecloth for my cheeseboard!
622008 Maybe so, but it's also the only way to find Plunder Cove!
622007 [giggling]
622008 [narrating] And Pinkie Pie was just about as helpful as a weasel in a hen house.
622007 Captain Pinkie Pie reporting for map duty!
62200d [yelps]
622000 [splash]
622008 Hold on, everypony!
622000 [splash]
622003 Wait, so it was Rarity and Pinkie's fault?
622008 Yup! And maybe if they ever apologized, I'll consider talkin' to them again.
622005 If they all blame each other, I don't know how we're gonna get them to talk again.
622003 Neither do I, Spike. Neither do I.
622003 There's gotta be some way to fix this. If Applejack, Pinkie Pie, and Rarity keep not talking to each other, they could forget what good friends they really are!
622005 I just don't get it! All of their stories are so different! [sigh] We're never gonna figure out what really happened.
622003 Their stories were different, but they also had a lot in common.
622005 I guess... They were all on a ship that sank, and... that's about it.
622003 Not quite.
622000 [chalk drawing]
622003 A-ha! Not only do I think I know how the boat sank, I have a pretty good idea how to get Rarity, Applejack and Pinkie Pie back together!
622005 I hope this plan of yours works.
622008 [panting] Winona brought me your note about a friendship emergency! H-How can I help?
62200d [panting] Opalescence delivered your message, Twilight! What's the emergency?
622007 It's a good thing it was time for Gummy's bath, or I might not have seen your note about the emergency, Twilight!
622000 [beat]
622041 What's she doing here?!
622003 Sorry, but I just didn't know how else to get the three of you here together, and there really is a friendship emergency! Yours!
622008 Oh, there's no emergency! I'm just waitin' for an apology.
62200d An apology?!
622007 What?! Why would you want me to apologize when it was Rarity's fault?!
62200d What are you talking about? Applejack clearly caused the boat to sink! She stranded us in the middle of the ocean!
622005 [frustrated scream] Will somepony please tell me how you made it back?!
622000 [beat]
622000 [splashing]
622008 [gasps]
62200d [gasps]
62200d Well... Maybe it wasn't the middle of the ocean...
622005 Ugh.
622008 Even so, I don't appreciate bein' hornswoggled into comin' back here.
62200d On that, at least, we agree.
622007 Yeah!
622003 I know you each have a different perspective on how the boat capsized and blame each other, but if you come on the boat with me I'll show you what really happened.
62200d Well, not that I have any doubts, but it will feel good for everypony to see exactly whose fault it was.
622008 I think we all know which pony's about to be proven right.
622007 We sure do.
622005 Like I said, I sure hope this works.
622005 [nervous laugh] [hushed] Whatever you're looking for, I hope you find it soon!
622003 Don't worry, Spike. I've got it all under control. [to the others] While all of your stories seem very different, they all had something in common – cucumber sandwiches.
622000 [clunk]
622008 What in the hay does that have to do with anythin'?
622000 [splash]
62200d And why would you waste a perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?
622003 You also mentioned the bubbling water.
622000 [bubbling]
622003 And the swell. Cucumber just happens to be the favorite food of the tri-horned bunyip, and bubbles followed by a swell is what happens when they swim up to the shallows from deep water.
622008 So... we attracted a tri-horned whatchamacallit?
62200d With cucumber sandwiches?
622007 Sounds like a stretch.
622003 Hello, bunyip, sir!
622000 [bunyip noises]
62200d So that's a...
622003 A tri-horned bunyip! Who's very sorry he accidentally knocked over your boat. Right?
622000 [bunyip noises]
622007 Wait, the storm had nothing to do with the capsizing?
622003 Nope!
62200d All right. Even if our friend the bunyip is responsible for sinking the boat, it still doesn't excuse a certain pony's behavior!
622008 Me?! How about you and Pinkie Pie?
622007 Pfft– What? Who? Me? No–
622003 I think I can explain that too. Each of you spent so much time trying to come up with the perfect way to get the others out of their element, that you didn't notice your friends were doing the same thing!
622008 Wait a minute. You brought all those games and things for us?
622007 Of course! I figured the boat trip was the perfect time to do things that were silly and fun!
62200d And I was just trying to give the two of you the elegant cruise I thought you deserved.
622008 And I just wanted to give you two a high seas adventure, since that'd be somethin' new and different for y'all.
622041 Ohhhh.
62200d That is so sweet. You must have gone through so much trouble.
622008 Well, not half as much trouble as you did makin' all that fancy food, and bringin' all those games!
622003 I guess this just teaches us that even long time friends need to work at communication.
622007 Well, there's something I'd like to communicate to you all right now! You girls are the best friends a pony could ever have!
62200d Oh, let's never fight again!
622007 You got it!
622008 [simultaneously] Agreed!
622000 [bunyip noises]
622008 All right, you big softie! Bring it in!
622000 [bunyip noises]
622007 Come on, bunyip, sir! You got it!
622000 [splash]
622000 [coins clinking]
622003 One thing's for sure, Spike. There's nothing like a luxurious adventure boat party to get you out of your element.
622005 You said it!
622000 [credits]
623008 Well, that's the last of it, Filthy Rich.
623136 Just Rich, please. And on behalf of Rich's Barnyard Bargains, thanks for another season's shipment of zap apple jam.
623008 Our pleasure. See ya next time.
623000 [cart pulls away]
623008 Uh, Apple Bloom, did you pack up the cider into the same crates as the zap apple jam?
62300a Sure did! Now that I'm gettin' older, I wanna prove I can handle more responsibility on the farm.
623008 But the crates aren't marked. You kept track of what went into which crate, right?
62300a Oh. Um... y-yep. I totally kept track of everything.
623008 Good. Because we wouldn't want Filthy Rich to get a shipment of cider when he's supposed to get zap apple jam. You know how Granny feels about sellin' cider anywhere but on the farm. Are you sure he got the right crates?
62300a [huffs] Sure I'm sure! Now why don't you and Big Mac head on out to the house and let me finish up here?
623000 [glass jars rattle]
623008 If you gave Rich the zap apple jam, then what's this here?
62300a Um... extra?
623026 Nnnope.
623000 [theme song]
623136 Granny knows I-I wasn't tryin' to make off with a shipment of cider, right? Because I would never do that.
623008 Don't worry. We know exactly whose fault it was.
623000 [cart pulls away]
623000 [crate dragging]
623008 Now why in tarnation would you lie to me, Apple Bloom?
62300a I was kinda hopin' I could fix it before anypony found out.
623008 Tellin' lies won't fix anythin'. Trust me. I know.
62300a What could you possibly know about it? You've never told a lie in your whole life!
623026 [laughing]
623009 [laughing]
62300a What's so funny?
623009 Oh-ho, sugarcube. [laughing] Your big sister lied so much when she was a filly, the whole family ended up in the hospital.
62300a What?!
623026 [laughing] Eeyup!
623008 [groans] You might as well tell her the whole story. Might even do her some good.
623009 When Applejack and Big Mac were just a wee bit older than you are now, they both kept a-squabblin' over who would run the farm better.
6230af All I'm sayin' is that you may have plenty of brawn, but I'm the one with the ideas on how to run things better around here!
62337f [laughs] Applejack, Applejack, Applejack, ideas are all well and good, but you can't plow a field with 'em. I don't know how many times I've told you that.
6230af Too many!
623009 You two horned toads better stop jabberin' and get to workin'! Yeah, they'd better. I need you to go to town. The apple blight's been awful, and if we don't get more spray, cider season'll be shorter than a dwarf crabapple tree!
623380 [snarl]
62337f It's like I was just tellin' Cousin Braeburn last week. Now there's a pony who knows how to put his back into a problem...
6230af [growls] Oh, hey there, Filthy Rich!
623136 Just Rich, please. And I'd you to meet my fiancée, Spoiled Milk. Honey, this is Applejack and Big Mac, the two hardest workin' ponies at Sweet Apple Acres.
623381 You work on a farm? How... quaint.
623136 [chuckles] Oh, now, dear, be nice. Sweet Apple Acres makes zap apple jam. It's one of Dad's best-sellers.
623381 You mean one of your best-sellers. [to AJ and Big Mac] My amazing husband-to-be is running the Rich family business now. Did you know that? Well, now you do.
623136 [chuckles] Don't mind Spoiled Milk. She's just proud of me. Uh, but she's right. I'm in charge of the store now, and I'm just burstin' with ideas I wanna try!
6230af Like what?
623136 Well, how 'bout this? Cider season's around the corner. Why not let me sell it for ya?
6230af That is an interesting idea.
62337f Well, maybe it's interestin', an' maybe it ain't. But it's definitely not a new idea. Granny Smith told us your grandpa, Stinkin' Rich, used to ask her every year if he could sell our cider in your store, and Granny told him every year about the tradition of everypony in Ponyville linin' up out at Sweet Apple Acres.
623136 So start a new tradition. Some day, one o' y'all will take over the farm just like I've taken over the store. I'm guessin' it'll the one with the best ideas.
62337f Well, now, as I've said many a time before, ideas are all well an' good, but you can't plow a field—
6230af Ya know what? How 'bout we give you three barrels of cider early, and if it sells well, we'll make a deal for the rest?
623136 Oh, hey, now! Perfect! [to Spoiled Milk] Come on, honey. I've gotta get everything ready.
6230af Hoo-wee! I tell ya, if the future means me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres and you bein' quiet, I can't wait!
62337f I just can't believe you'd make a deal with Filthy Rich without even talkin' to Granny!
6230af Aw, Granny will love the idea. And then she'll decide that I'm the one who should take over the farm. You'll see.
623009 See what?
62337f Applejack here had another one of her "big ideas", and I think we all know my position on ideas. You can't—
623382 "Can't plow a field with 'em."
62337f Ee... right.
623009 Big idea, hmmm?
6230af Actually, more of an opportunity. Y'see, we ran into Filthy Rich in town. Did ya know he's runnin' the family store now?
623009 And what does this here "opportunity" mean for Sweet Apple Acres?
6230af Well, uh, since cider season is almost here, he—or, I-I mean, I—thought it'd be a good idea to give him a few barrels of cider to sell at the store before the season starts.
623009 Oh, is that all? Absolutely not!
6230af [groans]
6230af [scoffs] But, Granny, why can't we sell a few barrels o' cider early to Filthy Rich? And how is it any different than when you gave zap apple jam to Filthy's grandpappy to sell?
623009 Your cider and your jam ain't the same thing! Zap apple jam jars preserve the flavor for moons, but cider starts to spoil the second it comes out the press. That is why every cider season, all of Ponyville lines up at Sweet Apple Acres. And first come is first served! Hmph!
6230af I get what you're sayin', Granny. But couldn't you make an exception just this once? I sort of promised.
623009 Mm, meh-enh. Besides, cider-makin' is iffy business. And we're probably not gonna have a lot this year anyway, what with all the blight. I am sorry, Applejack, but you's just gonna have to un-promise.
6230af [sighs] Oh.
62337f I hate to say I told you so, Applejack, but—
6230af You an' I both know you don't hate to say anythin'.
62337f Well, I've always thought that the most important thing a pony can do is say exactly what's on his mind to anypony who'll listen, so everypony everywhere always knows everythin' they're thinkin', and—
6230af And you don't ever have to listen to anypony else.
62337f What?
6230af Exactly.
623136 Well, if it ain't my new business partner!
6230af Uh, about the cider, Rich...
623136 Take a look at what I did last night after we made our deal!
623000 [zip!]
623136 Whoo! Ha! Pretty great, huh?
6230af The thing is, I-I don't think I can get you any.
623136 What? Well, I did all this work on your say-so! We shook hooves and everything!
62337f Well, you see, at Sweet Apple Acres, we've always been about quality, and while your basic jam jar'll keep—
6230af Plus it's been a tough harvest this year, what with all the blight.
623136 Gah! Sounds to me like you're tryin' to make excuses! Whenever Granddad dealt with Granny Smith, she kept her word! If you can't do that, then maybe our families should stop doin' business together! Altogether!
62337f Now, now, the thing is, Rich, it ain't really up to us. Y'see, Granny's—
6230af Uh, sick!
623136 Wait, Granny's sick? I-I had no idea.
62337f Ee... yeah. Nopony did.
6230af Uh, what Big Mac means is, uh, we've been tryin' to keep it quiet. Don't want people to make rash decisions about doin' business with Sweet Apple Acres just because we're, uh, a little short-hooved at the moment.
623136 Oh, my! O-Of course, of course! I am so sorry. Please let me know if there's anything I can do.
6230af Much appreciated. But right now, we-we only ask for your understandin' during this difficult time.
623136 Mm-hmm.
62337f You were supposed to tell Rich the simple truth! But instead, you made things worse with a giant lie!
6230af W-W-What was I supposed to do? You heard Rich. If I told him the truth, he was gonna stop doin' business with us altogether.
62337f Yeah, but that's only because I... I forgot to ask if we had any oat crumbles for this delicious-lookin' salad, Granny.
623009 [grunts] Yeah, I'll go take a look. [mutters]
62337f [hushed] That was only because you made promises you couldn't keep! But there's gotta be a better way out of this mess than by makin' up some story about Granny bein' sick!
6230af [hushed] Well, it worked, didn't it?
623000 [knock on door]
623136 Sorry to drop by unannounced. We just wanted to come by to wish Granny a speedy recovery.
62337f [sarcastic] Look, sis. Our good friend, Mr Rich and his fiancée... are here. Oh, and they brought flowers! For Granny! On account o' she's sick! Like you said. Ain't that sweet?
623000 [door rattles]
6230af Uh, excuse me one second!
623000 [door closes]
623009 Aah!
623000 [crash!]
623009 Golly, what in tarnation?
6230af Oh, I'm sorry, Granny. I-I didn't see ya there.
623009 Ya came blastin' in so fast, t'weren't possible to see nothin'!
6230af Can you go out to the barn? I, uh, I think I might've left a blight sprayer in the orchard.
623009 Are you outta yer apple-pickin' mind?! It's suppertime, girl!
6230af I know, but, uh, if we forgot a sprayer, I'd wanna get it before dark. You go start countin', a—and I'll tell Big Mac we'll be right back, okay?
623000 [door slams]
62337f ...so from that moment on, I took to referrin' to myself as Big or Large or...
623136 Oh, Applejack! Your brother was just explainin' why he always wears his yoke.
623381 Even though we asked him how your grandmare is doing!
6230af Oh, well, you know how Big Mac can get to... to talkin', especially when he's upset. And right now, he's just as worried about Granny Smith as I am.
623136 Oh, dear. Is she doin' that bad?
6230af Well, one thing's for sure, she... she shouldn't be seein' anypony right now. In fact, I'm gettin' more upset just thinkin' about it. Excuse me.
623000 [thud]
623009 D'oh! What in the frilly fumidil has gotten into you?!
6230af Sorry, Granny. I just decided if I helped you, it would go faster.
623009 Well, you're too late. All the sprayers are here.
6230af Oh, good. Uh, say, Granny, when did you first fight the apple blight again?
623009 It was my second year here in Ponyville. Uh, they was before I had the rick on the one knee.
62337f ...and others say that's how the trees got to growin' so tall. But to me, it's just how I got my cutie mark!
623381 But we asked when we could come back to see Granny.
6230af Uh, Big Mac didn't wanna be rude, but you just can't see Granny right now, because she's... got apple blight!
623136 [gasps] I thought only trees got the blight!
6230af Yeah, that's usually the case. [beat] The doctors think it's from workin' in the orchards for so many years. [beat] Y'see, we had to take Granny to Ponyville General. We just got back right before you showed up.
623136 Oh, my. That is terrible!
623381 Ew! It's not contagious, is it?
6230af Um, I'm sure you'll be fine, but you should leave... [coughs] ...just in case.
623136 You're right. We're gonna have to hurry if we wanna get there before visitin' hours are over.
6230af That's right. Wait. Get where?
623136 Why, the hospital, of course. I'm sure we'll see you there.
62337f Tellin' Filthy Rich that Granny's in the hospital just made everythin' a hundred times worse! What are we supposed to do now?
6230af I got it!
623009 Dropped my second best teeth right in the pigpen, and that was the worst case of apple blight I have ever seen!
6230af I'd love to hear more, Granny, but we gotta get to the hospital right away!
623009 The hospital? Why? Who's sick?
62337f You are, apparently.
6230af What he means is you're needed at the hospital.
623009 Heh. Whatever for?
6230af It's the apple blight! It's startin' to infect ponies now! The doctors need an expert opinion, and nopony knows more about fightin' blight than Granny Smith!
623009 Well, what in tarnation are we waitin' for? Let's go!
62337f [inhales] [chokes]
6230af [gasps] You know, we're supposed to go in, uh, in the back! Uh, to avoid anypony in the waitin' room with the blight.
623000 [indistinct conversations]
6230af Oops! I almost forgot!
623000 [hooves squeaking on tiles]
62337f Hrk!
6230af This is perfect! Now you don't have to worry about catchin' the blight.
623009 [slightly muffled] If you say so, dearie.
6230af Now you wait right here while I, uh... check on your presentation!
623009 What in the rotten rhubarb is goin' on here?
6230af [nervous laugh] Fancy meetin' you two here!
623381 Well, we told you we were coming.
623136 Well, I'm glad we found you, because I can't seem to find Granny's room or any nurses who've even heard about a pony with apple blight.
6230af Granny's room. Sure! Just go down here, take a left, then a right, go down some stairs, up a bunch more stairs, uh, through the cafeteria, left three more times, and then you're there! Easy as Granny's apple pie! [nervous laugh]
623136 Uh, aren't you comin' with us?
6230af Uh, I'll catch up! I gotta find Big Mac!
6230af Okay, Granny, just wait here one second and we can go.
623009 Where are you two going?
6230af Big Mac can't come! He, uh, might be contagious!
623383 Contagious?!
6230af All right, climb up here and I'll cover you up. Then I'll bring Rich in, tell him you're Granny, but you're not allowed to take the sheets off. You moan a few times, he leaves, and this whole thing is over.
62337f This is spinnin' way out of control, Applejack! Now I know you thought sellin' cider in Filthy's store was a good idea, but it ain't worth lyin' to him about Granny bein' sick and needin' to go to the hospital, or fibbin' to Granny about them wantin' her come here to talk about the blight, or—
6230af Big McIntosh, please just listen to me for once! This ain't about my ideas. If Rich finds out about all the lies, he'll cut off ties with us and the farm'll go under! Now do you want that to happen, or do you wanna help?
62337f Why can't you be Granny? You're her size, and this is all your fault in the first place.
6230af I would, but if I let you do the talkin', you'd just ramble on and on until we all got caught!
62337f [groans]
6230af Just lay down, keep still, and promise me you won't say anythin' for once in your life!
62337f [unconvinced] Eeeeyup.
6230af Granny! [squeaks] [hushed] Granny!
623009 It's about time! What is goin' on around here?!
6230af Uh, Granny, they need you to wait here! I'll come get ya!
623000 [door opens]
623009 [yelps]
623000 [door closes]
623136 [panting] There you are! We've been going in circles looking for Granny's room!
6230af Well, you're in luck, 'cause it's-it's right over here, and this time I'll make sure you don't get lost.
623000 [gurney squeaking]
6230af What in the dadgum—?!
623381 What now?
6230af He– I mean, she was right here! Oh, no. We gotta go!
623000 [gurney squeaking]
623381 I-Is that Granny Smith?
623136 Where are they takin' her?
623000 [door opens]
623000 [gurney squeaking]
6230af You two, don't lose that gurney! [hushed] Granny, what are you doin'? You were supposed to stay there!
623009 It was a supply closet!
6230af Oh. Uh... Well, okay, come with me, but be quiet! You know, save your voice for the big presentation!
623000 [door opens]
6230af [gasps]
623384 I-I-I'm sorry, but you can't get any closer without a gown and mask.
6230af But-but-but-but that's my brother on there!
623384 Don't worry. This is our best doctor. She'll have your brother back on his hooves in no time.
6230af [groans]
623009 Now apple blight is a serious disease!
623385 [splutters] Did she say... apple blight?
623386 I think she said "gasket mites".
623009 And once your trunk turns red like this, the only thing to do is prune the branches.
623136 [gasps] Oh, no! Granny!
623386 Did you say..."prune them branches"?
623009 Well, sure! What else you gonna do once the blight gets this bad?
623000 [cloth moving]
623000 [scare chord]
623000 [doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]
6230af Everypony, just stop! This is all a big misunderstandin'! [pants] Actually... it's a big lie.
623000 [cloth moving]
623000 [doctors, nurses, and audience gasping]
623009 Big Mac?!
623136 [gasps] Granny Smith?! What is goin' on here, Applejack?!
623009 That is a darn good question.
6230af [sighs] I'm not sure if I was worried that nopony was listenin' to my ideas or just nervous that I wouldn't be the one to end up runnin' the farm, but... I promised somethin' to Filthy Rich that I couldn't deliver, and I was too embarrassed to admit it.
623136 So Granny was never sick?
623009 And there ain't no apple blighted ponies?
62337f Nnnope.
6230af Those were all lies. A-And I thought if you found out, you'd stop doin' business with the farm. So I just kept tellin' more.
623384 So she's not a doctor?
6230af Please don't make Granny and the farm suffer for what I did! This whole thing is my fault.
62337f That's... not entirely true. Maybe if I paid more attention to what you had to say instead of talkin' all the time, none o' this would've happened in the first place. I just need to... talk less and listen more. Especially to you.
6230af [sighs] Thanks, big brother. And whether it's me runnin' Sweet Apple Acres or you, I know it'll be in good hooves.
623009 Well, that's nice, but I don't know what in blazes you two are talkin' about! I ain't goin' anywhere anytime soon! [blows raspberry] Runnin' the farm. Not after this display! Not likely! [to Filthy Rich] And don't you go gettin' any ideas about cuttin' ties with Sweet Apple Acres, or I'm goin' right to your grandpappy. Get me?
623136 [stutters] Um, yes, ma'am.
623009 Now, who here still wants to hear about the apple blight? Now, when I was a filly...
62300a I can't believe you told all those lies!
623008 It's not a story I'm proud of, but it taught me a lifelong lesson about bein' honest. I hope you learned somethin', too.
62300a I sure did. I learned that nopony starts out perfect and sometimes you gotta make a few mistakes to figure out who you are.
623026 Eeyup.
62300a But I think the most important thing I learned is who really runs Sweet Apple Acres.
623135 Granny!
623009 You're darn tootin'! Now everypony quit your lollygaggery and get back to work! Right after we have a glass of cider.
62300b [laughing]
623000 [credits]
624000 [locker door opens]
62400c Spring training was awesome, but I can't wait to see my friends!
624000 [locker door closes]
62400c I'm gonna catch up on some Daring Do with Twilight, help Applejack make my favorite cider, and have a sleepover with Pinkie!
62407a We get it. You have a fun week planned.
62407c Meanwhile, I'm stuck here running trials week at the Academy.
62400c But you love yelling and blowing your whistle.
62407c Yeah. I do.
62400c See you gals later!
624000 [whoosh]
62400c [chuckles]
624000 [whoosh]
62400c [sighs]
624000 [cutie mark ringing]
62400c Huh? Oh, the map!
62400c Hey, Twilight! So where am I going? The Crystal Mountains? Vanhoover? Here? Please say here.
624003 Well, the good news is we both got called by the map!
62400c Awesome! [beat] Does that mean there's bad news?
624003 No. Well, not exactly.
62400c [groans] I was just there!
624000 [theme song]
624000 [whoosh]
624003 Ooh!
62400c Ahem.
62407c All right, newbies! Welcome to trials week for the Wonderbolt Academy! You'll be judged on your speed, strength, agility, and technique, culminating in a final evaluation. Will it be hard? Yes! Will you cry? Maybe. Will you fly so much your wings fall off? That has only happened once.
624387 She's just exaggerating to make a point, right? I mean, wings can't really fall off... can they?
62407c You think you've got what it takes to be an elite flyer?
624388 Yes, ma'am.
624389 Yes, ma'am!
62407c Well, lemme tell you. You don't!
62400c [sighs wistfully] I remember when she said that to me.
62438b [muttering in awe]
624387 You don't think Rainbow Dash is the pony whose wings fell off, do you?
62407c [blows whistle] Quit your whispering and give me five hundred laps! Go, go, go!
624000 [whooshes]
624387 Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my favorite ponies in all of Equestria.
62407c Well, isn't that sweet? Now get going on those laps!
624000 [whoosh]
62407c Welcome, Princess Twilight. [to Rainbow Dash] What are you doing back so soon?
62400c Official friendship business.
624003 Have you noticed anypony having a hard time with their friends?
62407c Not really, but it's not my job to worry about their relationships. I'm here to make them elite flyers.
62400c [sighs] Adorable. They're so full of hope and competition. Eh, their technique could use some work, though.
624003 You should tell them. I'm sure they'd appreciate any notes from you.
62400c Nah. I wouldn't want to mess with their confidence.
624003 But they'll never get better if they don't know what to work on.
62407c Sloppy wing placement, crooked lines... I'm gonna have to drill them on basic technique in the classroom portion.
624003 Classroom portion?
62407c Yeah, it's everypony's least favorite part of trial week, but it has to be done.
624003 Maybe we can help!
62400c We can?
624003 Absolutely! Between your flying skills and my teaching expertise, they could learn a lot! Plus, once they get to know us, they'll be more comfortable coming to us with their friendship problems!
62400c Count us in!
62407c Great! [blows whistle]
624000 [whooshes, thud]
62407c You have your work cut out for you.
624003 Thank goodness I had time to whip up a few charts on flight patterns and wing symmetry! It's fresh in my mind from when I learned to fly! This is so exciting!
62400c Maybe for you. I practically fell asleep when I went through this. Tell you what. I'll leave the teaching stuff to you, and I'll just make sure they stay awake! [blows airhorn]
624000 [Twilight's ears ringing]
624003 I'm pretty sure their thirst for knowledge will keep them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
62400c [chuckles] Good one, Twilight.
624000 [door opens]
62400c [blows airhorn]
62438b [gasping]
62400c Wake up, newbies! Class is in session!
624003 Hello, students! I'm Twilight Sparkle, and this is Rainbow Dash.
62400c But you can call us "T-Sparks" and "The Dashinator"!
624003 [clears throat]
62400c [laughs nervously] Just kidding.
624003 And we're here to go over basic flying technique.
624388 [groans]
62400c Who said that?!
624388 Me. I mean, we're here because we're amazingly awesome crazy-good flyers. We're way past basics.
62400c What's your name?
624388 Sky Stinger. You've, uh, never heard of me?
62438a He set the record for the fastest vertical acceleration rate! Five hundred feet in two seconds!
62400c [unimpressed] Huh. That's pretty impressive.
62438a It's amazing.
624003 [clears throat] It is, and we can talk personal records after class, Ms...?
624388 Vapor Trail. She's my wingpony. I never fly without her.
62400c But you'll have to in the solo trials.
62438a There are... [gulps] ...solo trials?
62400c Yup. It's a part of your final evaluation.
624388 [scoffs] We'll ace that test with our wings tied behind our flanks. My picture will go right up there, next to yours.
62400c That's a mighty big claim, considering everypony here is an amazingly awesome crazy-good flyer.
624388 I know.
624003 [clears throat] Okay! Let's get back on track. Now, who can tell me the best wing angle to achieve minimal air resistance?
62400c [snoring]
624003 [blows airhorn]
62400c [quickly] Wake up newbies! Class is in session!
624000 [door opens]
62438b [chattering]
624003 Well, there were a few hiccups, but overall, that went pretty well.
62400c [cricks neck, yawns] Yeah, nopony fell asleep. What? I'm not a student!
624388 Hey, Teach!
62400c Me or Twilight? Probably Twilight.
624388 Um, uh, both. About the solo test. I'm actually kinda worried about it.
624003 Aw, that's all right. We all have moments where we doubt ourselves.
624388 No, no. I've absolutely zero doubts about myself. I'm a strong flyer. Like, really, really, really strong. This isn't about me. I'm worried for Vapor.
624003 Oh, well, that is very... kind of you?
62400c Tell you what. It's almost time for your freestyle training. Why don't you grab her and show us what you got?
624388 Yes! Prepare to be impressed!
624000 [whoosh]
624388 By me.
624000 [whoosh]
624388 Like I said, Vapor still needs work.
624000 [whoosh]
624000 [whooshing]
624003 Well, he may be full of himself, but I have to admit, Sky is an excellent flyer. He must have shot up two hundred feet!
62400c But did you see Vapor Trail? Her wing was under his. I think she gave him a boost.
624003 I guess I didn't even notice Vapor. I was too busy watching Sky.
624000 [whooshing]
624003 [gasps] I think you're right! Vapor just created a gust of wind that caught Sky's wing at a forty-five degree angle, propelling him into a flipping loop! [beat] Somepony paid attention in class!
62400c Sky obviously has no idea he's not actually amazingly awesome.
624003 And Vapor's so busy making her friend look good, she's not focused on her own flying at all. [gasps] This must be our friendship problem! And there's only one thing to do!
62400c Rainbow Dash:
62400c Fix it without telling them.
624003 Twilight Sparkle:
624003 Tell them the truth.
624000 [distant whooshing]
624003 You don't want to tell them?
62400c Of course not! Flying is like thirty percent skill and seventy percent confidence! You can't mess with a flyer's confidence!
624003 But you can't improve if you don't think you have to! Besides, Vapor's keeping a pretty big secret from Sky, and that could lead to trouble!
62400c Yeah, but if we tell them that they've been holding each other back, that could be trouble too!
624388 Ah, I nailed that flipping loop. I'm actually surprised you're still here. Thought I blew you away.
62438a [out of breath] You were... great, Sky.
624000 [thud]
62407c Come on, Vapor Trail! You're gonna have to build up your endurance if you want a shot at the Academy! Wonderbolts don't get winded! Angel Wings, you call that cloud-busting?! That cloud barely knew you were there! I love my job.
624388 We'll keep working, and who knows? One day, you might come close to being almost as good as me.
62438a Oh, I don't think so. You were voted Stratusburg's most promising flyer! I was voted best sneeze. [sneezes]
624388 You do have a really great sneeze.
62438a Thanks, Sky, but I don't think I can sneeze my way into the Academy. [sighs] I'm pretty beat. I'm gonna hit the showers.
624388 You have to help her.
624003 Actually, she's not the one—
62400c Will do!
624000 [locker opens]
62400c Hey, you did great. You're a really strong flyer.
62438a Uh, me?
624003 Vapor Trail, we know what you've been doing.
62400c You've been doing great!
624003 [groans] You've been helping Sky!
62438a Uh, I don't know what you're talking about! Sky doesn't need anypony's help. He's amazing.
624000 [poink poink]
62400c [sighs] Not without you. And it's gonna be pretty obvious during the solo trials when he can't get enough air to do a flipping loop.
62438a Oh, no! I can't let that happen! I mean, ah, uh... Aw, sugarcubes!
624003 Why are you doing this for him?
62438a [sighs] It started when we were kids. You have to understand...
62438a [narrating] ...Sky grew up with a lot of siblings. It was tough. He was always trying to get his parents' attention. Meanwhile, I was an only child who hated all the attention I got from mine.
62438c Vapor Trail! Where are you? Do you need a snack? Do you wanna do homework?
62438d Or we can just spend some time together! All day is never enough!
62438e [sighs]
62438f Mom, Dad, I'm here! Look, look, look-look-look-look, hey! Mom, Dad, can you see?
624000 [wind blowing]
624000 [whooshing, baby crying]
62438f [sighs]
62438e Whoa, that was amazing!
624000 [whoosh]
62438a [narrating] Flying together gave us both what we wanted! But I never told Sky how much I was helping him. It started with a small boost here or a little gust of wind there, but I didn't think my help could actually hurt his chances.
624003 I understand. But now you're both in trouble!
62400c You need to work on your tricks, and Sky needs to be able to fly without you or he won't make it.
62438a Oh, but he has to! Flying with the Wonderbolts has been Sky's dream ever since he was a colt!
624003 What about you?
62438a I... I guess I haven't thought about it. I just want to be with my best friend.
62400c Then we have to find a way to help both of you.
624003 Starting with telling Sky the truth.
62438a No, you can't! Sky will be crushed! And without his confidence, he won't fly as well!
624003 [sighs] Then I guess we'll give Dash's method a shot.
62400c Yes! Hah-hah! I love being right! Okay, here's what we do. Sky needs to build his strength. Air drills, wing lifts, all that boring methodical stuff.
624003 Sounds like my cup of oats.
62438a But how will we get him to do that? He doesn't think he needs practice.
62400c We'll just tell Sky that he should practice with Twilight so you won't feel so self-conscious about getting special training from me.
62438a With you? Really?! You'd do that for me?
62400c Hah. You say that like it's not gonna be a blast.
624000 [montage music]
624000 [thud]
62438a Whooa... Ah!
624000 [clang, clang, clang, clang]
624000 [whooshing]
624000 [wind blowing]
624000 [tires screeching]
62400c Oh, you were awesome!
62438a Really? Thanks! I can't believe I was able to keep up!
62400c That's the first nice thing I've heard you say about yourself.
624388 Hey, can we switch now? I want to do tricks with Rainbow Dash!
62438a You can't! I mean, uh, you're already so good at the fancy stuff!
624388 Heh. And the basic stuff. [beat] You're right, I don't need to practice at all.
62438a Um, maybe, Sky, you should...
624388 I'm already the best and everypony's gonna know it when I'm asked to join the Academy tomorrow.
62438a But not if you don't practice...!
624388 Heh. I wouldn't be surprised if they asked me to become a Wonderbolt straight out of the trials. Boom, dream achieved.
62438a [squealing] Sky, you're not as good as you think you are! [gasps]
624000 [beat]
624388 What did you say?
62438a [sighs] Sky, I want you to get in as much as anypony, and you're amazing, but...
624388 But what?
62438a I've been... helping you.
624388 [scoffs] Puh-lease! I don't need your help! Watch! [straining]
62400c Gyuh...
624000 [thud]
624388 [panting] How can you do this to me? Did you all know? Oh, great. So everypony but me knows I'm a joke. Was this your plan the whole time? To embarrass me?
62438a What? No! Don't you know me at all?
624388 I guess not, since it took me this long to find out you're a terrible wingpony!
62438a [gasps] I can't believe you!
624388 I can't believe I was ever your friend!
624000 [whoosh]
62438a Thanks a lot.
624000 [Dizzitron whirring]
62400c Do you think they're still mad?
624000 [beat]
62400c Yeah, they're still mad.
624003 This is all my fault. If we'd just done things your way, maybe we could have avoided this whole mess.
62400c No, it's my fault. It hit me when I was watching Sky train with you. He wasn't even trying!
624000 [Dizzitron whirring]
624000 [thud]
62400c Oh, no. He's lost his confidence.
62407c Do you want to tell me why one of my most promising students is flying like a balloon with a hole in it?!
62400c Uh, it's a long story, but we'll fix it.
62407c Yes, you will. [blows whistle]
624000 [thud]
62400c [groans] We really messed up, huh?
624003 I have a plan.
624388 [straining]
624003 Hey, Sky. I thought I might find you here.
624388 Well, apparently, I need a lot of practice. Guess I'm not the natural I thought I was.
624003 No, you're not.
624388 [sarcastic] Thanks. Good pep talk.
624003 I wasn't a natural at friendship. But with some practice and help from my friends, I got better, and now I'm the Princess of Friendship!
624388 So you're saying I can be the... Princess of Flying?
624000 [whoosh]
62400c You know, you're really good. You're lead pony material.
62438a Hm. That's sweet of you, but no. I couldn't handle all the attention.
62400c But you'll never become a Wonderbolt if you're too afraid to shine. That is what you want, right?
62438a Well, not at first. I just wanted to be with Sky. But learning to do all those fun tricks with you? It made me realize this is something I want for myself!
62400c I was hoping you'd say that. Come with me.
624388 What's she doing here?
62400c Sky, Vapor was never trying to steal your spotlight. She thought she was helping you.
624003 And Vapor, you shouldn't have been so content to take a back seat.
62400c Now, you can either stay mad, or help each other and become two of the greatest flyers the Wonderbolt Academy has ever seen! [beat] Please pick the second option. I don't want Spitfire to be mad at me.
624000 [whoosh]
624000 [wind blowing]
62438a You got this, Sky!
624388 Focus on a cloud when you spin! It'll help you fly straight when you come out of it!
62438a Uh-huh!
624000 [whoosh]
624000 [scribbling]
624000 [whoosh]
624000 [stopwatch ticking]
62438a [whooping]
624000 [tires screeching]
624000 [whoosh]
624388 Whoo, yeah! [laughs]
624000 [tires screeching]
624000 [whooshing]
62401b [cheering]
624000 [tires screeching]
62438b [cheering]
62407c Congratulations! You've both made it into the Wonderbolt Academy!
624000 [flump]
62407c Whatever you did, it worked. They still have a lot of potential. Who knows? They might even be better than you, Crash.
62400c [laughing] Okay, let's not get carried away.
624387 Um, I just wanted you to know, you two are my new favorite ponies in all of Equestria.
62400c Hey, I heard that!
62438a I can't believe we did it!
624388 You were great! Even though you can out-fly me, you can be my wingpony anytime.
62438a Aw. [chuckles] And you can be mine.
624000 [cutie marks ringing]
624000 [doors open]
62400c [spine clicking]
624000 [doors close]
624003 Phew. It's good to be home.
62400c [sighs] You're telling me. Now we can finally catch up with some Daring Do, I can make cider with Applejack—
624000 [knocking]
624000 [door opens]
62407a Dash! I've been looking all over for you! Wonderbolt emergency! We got to get back to HQ.
62400c You've gotta be kidding me! I was just there! [sighs]
624000 [thud]
624003 [laughing]
624000 [credits]
625005 [grunting, yelps] Well, we don't all have magical horns.
625003 I've been meaning to move these older books to my reference section for a while. Got to keep the new books front and center! Thank you both for your help.
62527c Are you kidding? After all you've done for me, this is the least I can do.
625003 Oh, please. I haven't done that much.
62527c Nah. You just taught me the value of friendship. Not much at all.
625003 I may have offered some guidance, but you are responsible for the pony you've become. I'm proud to call you my student and my friend. Now we just need to get rid of these boxes. Spike, can you—? Spike?
625005 What's that?
625003 Is it a bird?
62527c Is it a parasprite?
625005 It's... it's... incoming!
625000 [crash]
625003 Oh. I usually get letters by dragon.
625005 It is the fastest way to get mail!
62527c For me? Who'd be sending me a letter? It's... the ponies from my old village.
625003 Are they in danger?
625005 Are they upset with you?
62527c No... It's worse! They've invited me to the annual Sunset Festival!
625000 [theme song]
62527c [exhales] Uh, hey there, everypony.
62527a Uh... Hey, Starlight. What are you doing here?
62527c I-I... I was invited. To the Sunset Festival?
62527b Uh, yeah, but we didn't think you'd actually show up.
62527a You didn't think we really wanted you here, did you?
625000 [paper tearing]
62527c But... I... apologized. I thought everything was fine.
625390 [laughing derisively]
625391 [increasingly deranged laughter]
62527c Please...! Stop...! Stop!
625000 [beat]
62527c What happened? Is anypony there? Princess Luna? W-What are you doing here?
62501a Dreams are my domain, Starlight Glimmer. I am here because you need me to be.
62527c Oh. It's only a dream.
62501a It may only be a dream, but the feelings in it are real.
62527c [sighs] Great. So I guess I'm more afraid of going back to the village than I thought. What do I do now?
62501a I have been helped time and time again by six very special ponies. They helped me overcome my past. You're fortunate to have them as friends. I suggest you share your concerns with them. I see much of myself in you, Starlight Glimmer, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better.
625000 [magic zap]
62527c [gasps]
62527c ...and Princess Luna said I should tell you all how I was feeling. So... there it is. I'm afraid to go back to the village for the celebration.
62500d But why, darling? You went back to apologize. They accepted. Everypony has moved on.
62527c But have they? They don't really know how much I've changed. Or even worse, maybe I haven't changed as much as I think I have!
62500c Trust me. You are a totally different pony now. I mean, you were pretty awful.
625008 Rainbow Dash!
62500c What? She was! It's a compliment!
62500e I don't think they would've sent the invitation if they didn't want you to come. I'm sure they'd be happy to see you.
625007 And getting an invitation to a party and not going?! That's like... I-It's like...! Well, I don't know what it's like, but it is definitely bad.
625008 Just be honest with them. I'm sure they'll understand where you're comin' from.
625003 I understand how hard this is for you. Maybe if you took a friend along, it might make things easier. Somepony you trust who would look out for you?
62527c Thanks so much for doing this, Trixie. When Twilight said I should bring a friend, you were the first pony I thought of.
625037 Great idea, Princess Twilight. Asking me – Starlight's best friend – to help her on this difficult journey really shows how wise a princess you have become.
625003 [through gritted teeth] Thanks, Trixie. [hushed, to Spike] I was talking about me.
62527c The festival lasts a whole week, but I'm sure we won't stay that long.
625037 Oh. I don't know, Starlight. Time really flies when you're spending it with your best friend! [giggles]
625003 [strained noise]
625012 [overlapping farewells]
625000 [eagle cries]
625037 There it is! The town where you—
62527c Magically stole everypony's cutie marks, replaced them with equal signs, and forced them all to hide their natural talents? Yes.
625037 I was going to say where you came from, but yours is a more... emotionally traumatic answer.
62527c [sighs] I just want to... blend in. Be just another pony in the crowd enjoying the Sunset Festival with my friend.
625037 Sounds good to me! And if things get weird for you, just let me know. I've got your flank.
62527c Is that a promise?
625037 Not just a promise. A great and powerful promise!
625000 [bamf]
625037 [coughing]
62527c Well, I couldn't ask for more than that. If we're gonna do this, let's do it.
62527b Oh! Starlight, you came!
62527c [nervous giggle]
62527a We were worried you wouldn't be able to make it! Are you staying the whole week? We have different events planned each day!
62527f How is it living in a castle?
62527b It is so good to see you!
625037 [mock-whisper] Oh, yeah. These ponies are terrifying. [giggles]
62527c [small groan] It's good to see all of you, too.
62527a You got here just in time. We were having some debate about these banners. Which do you think feels more "sunsetty"?
62527c O-Oh, you don't need me to decide that. Heh. Whatever you think is probably best.
62527b Uh, well, how about helping us with the routes for the relay races tomorrow? Can you take a look?
62527c Oh, I-I shouldn't. You all go ahead. I-I just want to enjoy the festival.
62527f But you will be a judge for the baking competition, right?
62527b We had a few questions about the order of the acts for the talent show.
625279 And the unicorns have a fireworks show planned! We could really use your help!
625000 [villagers chattering loudly]
625000 [magic zap]
62527c No! [trembling]
625000 [villagers gasping]
625037 The Great and Powerful Trixie would like to thank you all for being such an amazing audience. Sadly, it is time for us to depart. Good night, fillies and gentlefoals!
625000 [bamf]
625000 [villagers coughing]
625000 [villagers shocked muttering]
62527c Ugh! I was horrible when I led that town! I was ready for them to not trust me, but... I wasn't ready for them to put me in charge again! With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!
625037 So you messed up. Big deal. [hushed] Don't you ever tell another pony I said this, but even Trixie's made mistakes. [giggles] I know! The trick is to just move on and pretend they never happened.
62527c I feel like that's almost good advice.
62527c Hey, uh, Pinkie Pie!
625007 Hey... [beat] you!
62527c So... you're probably wondering why I'm back so soon.
625007 Where were you?
62527c I... went to my old village? For the festival?
625007 Ooh, sounds fun! How was it?
62527c It was kind of a disaster. I came back early because I freaked out!
625007 Ooh, sounds awful! Bye!
62527c That was... strange.
625037 Isn't she always strange?
62527c Yeah, but not like that. Hey! I'm back early.
62500d Ah. Welcome back?
62527c Have you two noticed Pinkie acting a little strange?
625008 Pinkie Pie always acts strange.
625037 Told you.
62527c Anyway, I wanted to talk to all of you. Things didn't go the way I thought they were going to go at the Sunset Festival.
62500d What happened?
62527c I kind of freaked out and ran out of the village.
625043 [laughing]
625008 You freaked out and ran away from a festival? Ha! That's the funniest danged thing I've heard all day.
62500d [laughing] Oh my. Let me guess. The decorations were terrifying!
625043 [inconsiderate laughter]
62500e [whispering] ...Applejack for friendship business.
62500c Hello, ponies. We need Rarity and Applejack. Very important friendship business.
625037 I have to say, I'm really not as impressed with your friends as the rest of Equestria is.
62527c I need to talk to Twilight!
625000 [door creaking]
625000 [knocking]
62527c Twilight? Hello?
625005 What do you want? Twilight's very busy!
62527c Spike, I really need to speak with her.
625005 Make an appointment! She's a princess, after all!
625000 [hatch slams]
625000 [knocking]
62527c What's wrong with you? Why are you being so—
625003 Rude? I think a certain dragon didn't get his nap today.
625005 Yeah, right. Whatever.
625003 Sorry. He's been acting a little off all day. I think he missed a meal or something.
62527c He's not the only one. Everypony's acting a little strange today.
625003 Yes, it's definitely been one of those days! How are you?
62527c Not great, actually. You're probably wondering why I'm back from the village so early.
625003 I didn't want to bring it up, but yeah, it did seem strange. Did it not go well?
62527c The townsponies kept asking me things, like they expected me to be in charge again. But being a leader is the last thing I should ever be. So we left. Very suddenly. In a literal puff of smoke.
625003 Wow, you should definitely never go back to that village.
62527c What?
625003 If you were worried about what they thought of you before, it's probably way worse now. I'd cut my losses.
62527c That's... surprising advice, coming from you.
625003 Trust me. I'm the Princess of Friendship. You don't need those ponies. You can always make more friends.
625000 [door opens]
625003 Ah! Speaking of friends, if you'll excuse me, important business to attend to!
625000 [door closes]
62527c Cut my losses? That can't be right.
625000 [tumbleweeds rolling]
625000 [doors open]
62527c Hey, I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier. Party Favor, can you hear me?
625003 I told you you can never speak to them again!
62527c What are you all doing here?
625003 Making sure you do what I said! I'm your teacher, aren't I? Didn't I say to never come back here?!
62527c Yes, but that just doesn't seem right. You aren't acting like yourself.
625392 Something is wrong!
625000 [wind blows]
62527c A dream? This is another dream!
62501a [whispering] Starlight Glimmer...!
62527c Princess Luna?
62501a Starlight Glimmer!
62527c Princess Luna, where are you?
62501a Starlight Glimmer, there is no time! You must get help!
62527c What? What are you talking about? This is just a dream!
62501a Not here! In the waking world! They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time! Your dream called to me, and I was able to break through! You must find help!
62527c What are you saying?! Who's taken you?!
62501a Be careful who you trust! You need all the help you can find! The changelings have returned and— [gasps]
62527c Princess Luna!
62527c [panting] They're back!
625000 [bushes rustling]
625000 [knocking]
62527c Trixie? Trixie, it's Starlight! Are you awake?
625037 [muffled, bleary] Of course, Princess Celestia... I'd love to perform for peanut butter crackers...
625000 [knocking]
62527c Trixie, wake up!
625000 [fireworks exploding]
625037 [coughing] [tired] Starlight? What time is it?
62527c It's late. I think I figured out what's wrong with my friends!
625037 [yawning] I have a whole list of things that are wrong with your friends. We can go over it in the morning.
62527c No, Trixie, we're in danger!
625000 [door opens]
625037 [sighs] Okay, fine! Aside from lack of sleep, how are we in danger?
62527c I think the—! [beat] What did you tell me never to tell another pony?
625037 Starlight, if you woke me up to play guessing games—
62527c After we left my village, what did you tell me to never tell another pony you said?
625037 [sighs] [through very gritted teeth] That even Trixie's made mistakes.
62527c Trixie, there's no time for this! What did you say?
625037 That even Trixie's made mistakes! Okay? Are you happy?!
62527c [sighs] Yes. Sorry. I just had to make sure you weren't... [hushed] one of them!
625037 [hushed] One of who?
62527c A changeling! I think they've taken Princess Celestia and Princess Luna!
625037 What?! Are you sure?! I mean, what do we—? We have to tell Twilight!
62527c If I'm right, then it's too late for that.
625012 [unintelligible mutterings]
625000 [thwack]
625005 [yelps]
625000 [thwack]
625005 [groans]
62500d [inconsiderate laughter]
625003 Is it ready?
625008 Just one more.
625000 [magic energy crackling]
62527c Queen Chrysalis!
62519c Ugh. I can't take any of you seriously when you look like that.
625003 Oh, right.
625000 [changeling transforming zaps]
62519c Much better. Now report!
6251a3 Everything here is going according to plan! We've replaced the six ponies and their dragon, and have taken control of the castle!
62519c Excellent. And I've just received word that the princesses from Canterlot have successfully been replaced as well.
62519f [laughing]
62519c We thought too small last time. One ponynapped princess wasn't enough. With all the most beloved ponies of Equestria taken care of, nopony can stop us! [evil laughter]
62519f [laughing]
625000 [door creaks]
62519f [hissing]
625000 [changeling transforming zaps]
625000 [door slams opens]
625393 [as Twilight] [sniffing]
625037 [gasps for breath]
625000 [magic zap]
625000 [magic zap]
625037 [panting] I can't deal with this! I'm just a performer! This is... This is princess-level stuff! But the changelings have all the princesses... We're doomed!
62527c Maybe not. Uh, Queen Chrysalis only said they took Luna and Celestia and obviously Twilight and the others... but maybe Cadance is still safe. Our best bet is to get to the Crystal Empire before the changelings do. That way we can—
625361 There's no help coming from the Crystal Empire.
625037 [shrieks]
62527c Thorax?
625361 Yes.
62527c Your wings look... different.
625361 I guess they do.
62527c How do I know you aren't some other changeling pretending to be Thorax?
625361 You were there when Spike defended me to the ponies of the Crystal Empire. Princess Twilight said—
625000 [changeling transforming zap]
625361 As the Princess of Friendship, I should set an example for all of Equestria. But today it was Spike who taught me—
62527c Okay, okay. I believe you. We don't need the whole speech.
625000 [changeling transforming zap]
62527c Trixie, this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling. He's on our side. Understand?
625000 [pop]
625361 Hi. It's a pleasure to...
625037 If Starlight says you're on our side, I believe her. But maybe just stay over there for now, okay?
62527c What did you mean there's no help? Did the changelings get Cadance too?
625361 They took Cadance, Shining Armor, and Flurry Heart! Sunburst sent me here to get Princess Twilight's help, but... but it sounds like it's too late for that, too! So... what should we do?
625037 Yeah, Starlight. What are we gonna do?
62527c I... I don't know! There has to be somepony else who can handle this?
625037 There is nopony else! Everypony with powerful magic is already gone!
6250db You know whenever ponies talk about powerful magic, they always leave me out. If I weren't so evolved, I might decide to take it personally. Well, isn't this quite the combination of secondary characters? Where are Twilight and the girls?
62527c First, how do we know that you're really you?
6250db [snaps fingers]
625000 [magic zaps]
625000 [splash]
6250db Shall I continue?
62527c Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria! Celestia, Luna, Cadance, Shining Armor, Flurry Heart, Twilight and her friends. We need to—
625000 [magic zap]
6250db [hushed] They took Fluttershy?
62527c Yes!
6250db [menacingly] Where?
62527c The Changeling Kingdom. With you on our side, I can—
6250db [snaps fingers]
625000 [magic zap]
625000 [magic zap]
6250db Odd. I was trying to take us right to Fluttershy, but there is no Fluttershy.
625000 [crunch]
625037 [whimpers] I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be...
625361 I'd hoped never to see that place again. Now what?
625000 [to be continued]
625000 [credits]
626000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
62627c It's... the ponies from my old village.
626391 [increasingly deranged laughter]
62627c Oh. It's only a dream.
62627c With my past, I should never be in charge of anything!
62601a They've taken my sister and I! It's worse than the last time!
62627c Chrysalis and the changelings are back. They've ponynapped all of the most powerful ponies in Equestria!
62627c ...this is Thorax. He's a reformed changeling.
6260db [hushed] They took Fluttershy?
626037 [whimpers] I think I have a pretty good idea where she might be...
626000 [theme song]
6260db Oh, this is so strange. We're here and that's there, and I clearly meant for us to be there and not here.
626361 Oh, I-I can probably explain—
6260db Oh, well. If at first you don't succeed...
62627c Maybe we should come up with a plan first?
6260db [blows] A what?
626037 You know, figuring out the best way to do something before you actually do it.
6260db [laughs] Oh, that's adorable. But you see, unlike you, I can do anything.
626361 Uh, actually—
6260db That's all very nice, but really a waste of time. We have me. And what else could we possibly need?
626037 A draconequus with magic and half a brain might help.
6260db Why are you here again? I mean, it's not like you're going to stop the changelings by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. At least my magic can do something.
626361 The thing about magic here is—
6260db Like this! [snaps] For Fluttershy! Yaaah! [snaps]
626394 [oinks]
626361 I've been trying to tell you! Nothing other than changeling magic works here. Chrysalis' throne is carved from an ancient dark stone that soaks up outside magic the same way changelings soak up love. It's how she keeps the hive safe.
626000 [magic fizzles]
626037 [to Starlight] So, uh, what kind of plan were you thinking?
62627c Without magic, I have no idea. But nopony else is coming. So somepony better come up with something.
626000 [beat]
62627c Anypony? Anything? Hmm. This throne – if we get into the hive and destroy it, can we get our magic back?
626361 Uh-huh!
6260db Well, that's a terrible plan. How are we even supposed to get to the hive?
626037 We walk.
6260db I haven't walked that far in a millennia!
62632e [groan]
6260db Oh, I don't know how any of you manage not being able to disappear and reappear whenever you want!
626037 Well, I, for one, definitely miss you being able to disappear!
62627c Give Discord a break. None of us knew we weren't going to be able to use magic.
626361 I did.
62627c If we get separated, it might make sense to have a way to make sure we are who we say we are.
6260db Oh! Like a secret code! How about if I say "we are" and you say "doomed"? Or you say "rescue" and I say... [flails]
626037 How about if we say "klutzy" and you say "draconequus"?
62627c "Klutzy draconequus". Works for me.
626361 I'll definitely remember it.
626037 Okay. I am definitely glad you came. I don't think we'd be able to find our way without you.
626361 You definitely wouldn't.
626000 [rock creaking]
626037 Um, where's the way out?
626361 It's a changeling hive. It shifts and changes like we do, and we're the only ones who can navigate it. It's total chaos to non-changelings.
6260db Well, it's decent chaos. I don't know if I'd call it "total".
6260db Are we sure that I'll get my magic back when we destroy this throne thingy?
62627c If Thorax is right, then yes.
6260db [sarcastic] Well, that's reassuring.
626037 And how are we supposed to destroy the throne when we find it?
62627c I... don't know.
626037 [sarcastic] That's reassuring.
626000 [rustling]
6260db I don't suppose you brought any throne-destroying tools along with these useless sideshow props.
626037 Asks the Lord of Chaos who can't go for a walk without whining nonstop!
6260db Yes, but when the throne is destroyed, I'll be able to rip the very fabric of reality to save our friends, while you'll still be a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist!
626037 Self-absorbed?! Why, you...!
62627c Cut. It. Out! I'm just barely keeping it together, and it would be wonderful if you two could actually try to help instead of bickering like foals!
6260db [defeated] Okay.
626037 How can we help?
62627c Don't ask me! I couldn't even handle giving advice at the Sunset Festival, and I had magic then! And the three of us are as good as useless! At least Thorax knows where we're going.
626361 Um, guys? I think we're lost.
626037 Oh, great. We might as well just sit here and wait for the changelings to soak up all of our love or whatever gross thing it is that they do. How often do you all get hungry?
626361 Actually, I haven't been since I met Spike. And changelings are always hungry. We can never get enough love.
626037 Well, that's just super—
62627c But you aren't hungry at all now?
626361 Huh. Once I made a few friends, I guess I just sort of forgot about the whole feeding thing.
62627c Is that about the same time your wings changed?
626361 I guess so.
6260db [yawns] While I would love to sit around chitchatting about feeding and not feeding, [echoing] I have a Fluttershy to save! [echoes]
626000 [changelings hissing]
626037 [hushed] Can you please lower your voice?! You're gonna get us all captured!
6260db Oh, you keep saying that, but I haven't seen an actual changeling since we got into this hive.
626000 [distant humming]
626037 W-What's that?
626361 A changeling patrol!
626000 [changeling screeches]
626361 [hyperventilating]
6260db This seems like one of those moments where we need a plan.
626037 What kind of plan?! We have no magic, and it's not like my illusions are gonna save us!
62627c Do you have any of your smoke bombs?
626037 Are you kidding?
626000 [changelings' wings buzzing]
626361 Looking for somepony?
626000 [changelings screech]
626361 Is that the best you've got?! [laughing]
626000 [various poofs]
6260db Not exactly great and powerful, but effective.
626037 Hm. I'll take it.
62627c "Klutzy"...
626395 ..."draconequus"!
626000 [transformation zap]
6260db Ugh. I really think we need a new code word!
626361 That was a pretty good plan.
626037 But we still don't know where we're going.
62627c Actually, we might. Two of the changelings didn't go with the rest.
626361 Oh! With an intruder in the hive, they went to protect the queen! Good thinking, Starlight!
62627c [embarrassed laugh]
626000 [changelings' wings buzzing]
626037 Now what?
62627c We... go in.
626361 Even if I wanted to, there's no way past the guards. We'll be spotted for sure.
62627c We need some kind of... distraction.
626037 I'm fresh out of smoke bombs.
6260db Normally, I'm the most distracting thing I can think of, but without magic...
62627c You shouldn't underestimate yourself.
626000 [doors closing]
6260db [taps microphone] Hello, changelings and changelettes! Believe me, I was just as surprised as you are that I'm here! When I heard that I'd be playing for a bunch of changelings, I was beside myself! Then I realized, it was just one of you.
626000 [rimshot]
626000 [changelings snarl]
6260db [nervous laugh] But, seriously, this isn't the toughest crowd I've ever been in front of. But it's definitely the easiest to bug!
626000 [rimshot]
6260db "To bug"? Is this thing on? [taps microphone]
626000 [changelings snarl]
6260db Well, if you think that you can do any better, be my guest!
626000 [microphone feedback]
626000 [changelings' wings buzzing]
626037 It is absolutely ridiculous that that worked.
626000 [changelings' wings buzzing]
6260db It is certainly a pleasure to have such dedicated fans. I'll have to come back with some new material after I rescue Fluttershy.
62600e [whimpers] Please, help! [whimpers]
6260db Fluttershy!
62600e Discord! I'm stuck!
6260db You certainly are. And I should probably help you get free. But... oh-ho-ho-ho-ho...
62600e But what?
6260db But you are obviously not Fluttershy!
62600e Oh.
6260db I mean, I'm separated from the group and just happen to come across the one pony I care most about? I can smell this setup a mile away.
62600e [sniffs, crying] No. You're right. There's no way you should trust me. Just go find the others. [wailing] I understand!
6260db Oh, come on!
626396 [crying]
626397 We're probably all changelings. You shouldn't rescue any of us. Unless, you think, maybe one of us might be the real Fluttershy. Oh, that certainly would be a nasty changeling trick, wouldn't it?
626396 [crying]
626398 I'm the real one.
626399 I'm the real one.
62639a I'm the real Fluttershy.
626361 We can't wait for Discord. Between seeing him and Trixie, the castle will be crawling with guards soon.
62627c But if we do manage to destroy Chrysalis' throne, we'll need him. He could take on the entire changeling army by sneezing if he wanted to.
626037 He's probably already been captured!
6261a3 Hello? Fellow rescuers?
626361 We can't stay here. We gotta find the throne.
6261a3 Ooh! I heard some of the changelings who were chasing me say that they know where it is!
626037 "Klutzy"...?
6261a3 Hmm? Oh. Yeah. [chuckling] I-I can be klutzy. Now, follow me.
62627c [whispering] You know that's not Discord, right?
626037 Obviously.
6261a3 This way! We're almost there!
626361 I know this trick. If he says to go left, we should definitely go right. He's leading us to a swarm waiting to attack!
626037 [sighs] Okay, I'll handle it. You two just get ready to run into the other tunnel.
62627c Wait, what?! Trixie, you can't! I won't know what to do! We've already lost Discord; I can't lose you too! Without magic, I—
626037 Starlight. You got us this far with just my illusions and Discord's annoying personality. You don't need magic to figure out what to do next. I know you're afraid to be in charge, but you are really good at it! Listen to your best friend. Hey, Discord! Want to see the new trick I've been working on? I call it the "Changeling Catcher"! Run!
626000 [transformation zap]
626000 [changeling hisses]
626000 [changelings hissing]
626037 [nervously] Ta-da...
626000 [changelings screech]
62639b [panting]
626000 [changelings' wings buzzing]
626000 [splat]
62619c [laughing evilly] One little pony all by herself. [joints cracking] Oh, how will I ever prevent this daring rescue?
626000 [changelings screech]
626000 [changelings hiss]
62619c Well, well, well. The Princess of Friendship's sole pupil. Honestly, I didn't think you were worth replacing with one of my drones.
626361 [strains] You won't get away with this!
62619c I already have. Nopony is coming to save you. Your little squad was it. And now, there's just you.
626361 Thorax is still out there.
62619c Don't mention that traitor's name in my kingdom! He was a fool to leave and even more a fool to return! When I find him, he'll learn just what happens to those who betray the hive!
626361 [whimpers]
62619c And it seems I don't have far to look, do I...
626361 [whimpers]
626000 [transformation zap]
62619c Thorax?
626000 [changelings hiss]
626000 [pounding]
62627c [whimpers]
626000 [zap]
62619c Very clever. And clearly Thorax revealed to you the secret of my throne. I can't have powerful ponies using their abilities against me. Even with your rather embarrassing little rescue attempt, everything has gone according to my plan.
62627c What plan? Why did you do all this?!
62619c So I could feed, of course! By replacing the most beloved figures in Equestria, my drones will be able to store all the love meant for them and return it here to me. Everypony will do as I command, and my subjects and I will feed on their love for generations! [maniacal laughter]
626000 [changelings hissing]
62627c What if you didn't have to?
62619c Ridiculous! The hunger of changelings can never be satisfied!
62627c Exactly! Thorax left the hive and made a friend. He shared love, and now he doesn't need to feed. You don't have to live your lives starving all the time!
62619c You know nothing of the changelings or what it takes to be their queen! I decide what is best for my subjects, not some mewling grub!
62627c I know what it's like to lead by fear and intimidation! And I know what it's like to want everypony to do what you say! But I was wrong. A real leader doesn't force her subjects to deny who they are! She celebrates what makes them unique and listens when one of them finds a better way!
62619c The only thing Thorax has found is what happens to those who turn their back on the hive!
626000 [dark magic]
62627c No! Stop!
62619c Just as soon as I drain every last ounce of love from him and show my subjects what a real leader is!
626361 [straining] I can feel the love inside me slipping away...! I can't hold onto it much longer...!
62627c Then don't! Sharing love is what made you different to begin with! You should share yours with Chrysalis! Give her all of it!
626000 [magic blasts]
62627c This is what happens when you give love freely instead of taking it!
626000 [transformation sounds]
626000 [kaboom!]
626000 [music]
6260db Fluttershy?
62600e It's, um, good to see you, too.
626003 Starlight? What happened?
62627c We defeated the changelings with no magic at all, they found a new leader, and... they're all kinda... good now.
62601a Well done, Starlight Glimmer. It seems as though you've learned a great deal since we last spoke.
626000 [rubble moving]
62619c [hissing]
626000 [triumphant music]
62627c When Twilight and her friends defeated me, I chose to run away and seek revenge! You don't have to! You can be the leader your subjects deserve.
626000 [wind rustling]
626000 [smack!]
62619c There is no revenge you could ever conceive of that will come close to what I will exact upon you one day, Starlight Glimmer!
626019 Thorax, as the new leader of the changelings, I look forward to discussing how we can improve our relationship in the future. However, for the moment, perhaps it is best that we leave the Changeling Kingdom to the changelings.
6260db Splendid idea! Now who's ready for some celebratory tea at Fluttershy's?!
62600e Oh! Uh, everypony?
62627c Actually, now that you can snap your claws and send us absolutely anywhere again, I think I have a better option.
62627a Uh, hey, Starlight. What are you doing here?
62627b You left in such a hurry before, we kinda thought you didn't wanna come.
62627c Yeah... I guess after the way I used my magic on all of you, I wasn't sure I was somepony who should even be in charge of a baking contest. I was afraid I might go back to being the pony I used to be. But I realize that sometimes you don't have a choice. You have to step up. And I have changed! I can handle it. Whether that means saving Equestria or helping friends out with the Sunset Festival. Speaking of which, I know the Festival's almost over, but I kinda invited a few of my friends to join. Hope that's okay.
62627b [laughing] Are you kidding? Of course!
62627c Great! Now where's that baking contest? This pony needs a cupcake!
6260db So I'm able to rip the very fabric of reality again.
626037 Yeah, yeah. And I'm still a self-absorbed, below-average illusionist, right?
6260db Actually, I was going to say a couple of those illusions were slightly above average. If you ever need a little chaos in your act, let me know.
626037 Ha! When pigs fly!
6260db Your wish is my command! [snaps]
626394 [squealing]
626037 Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
62600c Somepony is really gonna have to catch us up on what we missed.
626000 [credits]
701000 [knock, knock, knock]
701000 [door opens]
70127c Hey, Spike. What's up?
701005 Just, uh, wanted to make sure you're ready for your big ceremony today.
70127c Yep!
701000 [teleportation zap]
70127c Wow, I still can't believe my friends and I are getting medals...
701003 Shhh!
70127c ...of honor.
701005 Are you kidding? You totally deserve it! After all, you... saved Equestria from... Queen Chrysalis! With the help of Trixie and Thorax and Discord and...
70127c Uh, yeah. I know what happened. I was kinda there.
701005 Uh, right. Uh, so... what are you wearin'?
70127c Not sure. Why? Am I supposed to dress up?
701005 No! I-I mean, you could. It's like Rarity always says... [imitating Rarity] "There's no such thing as overdressed, darling. You're just the best-looking pony in the room." [chuckles]
70127c What are you looking at?
701005 No, don't look!
701000 [teleportation zap]
701005 'Cause there was a spider there, but it's, uh, gone now, so, uh... thanks, Starlight! Byeeee!
701000 [zip]
70127c Huh?
701000 [door closes]
701005 Ha-ha! She had no idea. We're a good team, Sparkle!
701003 "Sparkle"? [laughs] Yeah, we are. So do you think she'll like it? I want this present to say, "I'm so proud of you both as a mentor and a friend. Equestria is safer thanks to you."
701005 Oh. I thought you were getting her a mirror like yours.
701003 I am.
701005 Uh, maybe you should get her a card 'cause I don't think the mirror will say all that. But I think she'll like it.
701003 It's just what her room needs. The first thing she'll see when she wakes up is herself surrounded by all her friends. I plan on giving it to her after the ceremony.
701005 Yeah, about that. Don't you need to get the castle ready for the celebration?
701003 Nah. Pinkie Pie's got that covered.
701007 Hmmm.
701000 [party cannon squeak]
701007 Phew!
701000 [theme song]
701003 Starlight, Trixie, Thorax, and Discord were brave in the face of danger, resourceful when things got challenging, and proved that the bonds of friendship, no matter how unlikely, are stronger than any adversity. By stopping Queen Chrysalis, not only did they save Equestria; they set the changelings free from her reign.
701000 [zap]
7010db Go, Discord! Yahoo! [laughs]
70127c [giggles]
701019 And that's why we're proud and honored to give them the Equestrian Pink Hearts of Courage!
701000 [cheers and applause]
701000 [pop]
701007 Yeah! Oh. Uh, no. Not quite. Uh... all right. There it is!
701000 [pop]
701007 Yay!
701003 We are so proud of you all!
701000 [cheers and applause]
701000 [house music playing]
701037 It was the Great and Powerful Trrrrixie's pleasure to save you from your imminent doom.
7010db Yes, because you did it all by yourself.
70127c [giggles]
701315 I can't believe you managed to do it without magic.
7011a3 It was amazing!
7011a3 No one's ever stood up to Chrysalis like that!
70127c Oh, I just did what anypony would have done.
701019 It's a wonderful feeling, isn't it? Watching your student shine the way you always knew they could.
701003 [laughs] My cheeks are sore! I don't think I've ever smiled this much in my life!
701019 I can only imagine what that feels like.
7010db Yes, Starlight is student of the year, isn't she? She has so much potential. So, what are we going to do with her? And by "we", I definitely mean "you". Being her mentor and all that, her destiny falls squarely on your haunches.
701000 [teleportation zap]
701003 Oh, don't you worry. I've planned enough friendship lessons to cover the next three years.
7010db [laughs]
701003 What's so funny?
7010db No, no. Clearly, Starlight is beyond basic friendship lessons. She just won a medal, for Equestria's sake. I thought you were joking. You are joking, right?
701003 [nervous laugh] Of course I was.
7010db Obviously, you should have a grand master plan for her, the same way Celestia set you on the path that eventually made you a princess.
701003 Yep.
7010db Oh, good. I'm sure she can't wait to hear all about it.
701000 [zap]
701003 [nervous noise]
70127c So how's the whole ruling-a-kingdom thing going?
701361 It's a bit overwhelming. But we're adjusting.
70139c So, uh, you can't have friendship without makeovers?
701008 Eh, not-not exactly.
7010db Oh, Starlight. Princess Twilight has something very important to tell us. Well, just you, really, but I'm nosy and I want to hear.
70127c Okay. Would you excuse m—?
701000 [zap]
70127c Never mind. What's going on?
7010db Well, Twilight was just about to reveal her grand master plan for you.
70127c Really? I was kind of wondering what we were gonna do next.
7010db Yes. I'd say we were both fairly interested.
701003 [nervous] Of course you are. And I do have a plan, obviously. But now is clearly not the time to do it. You should enjoy your party. [sips punch]
701037 Starlight, come on! The Ponyville Chronicle wants to take our picture! Ugh. You, too, Discord.
701003 [sipping punch, sighs]
701000 [zap]
7010db Psst! I see what you're doing.
701003 You do?
7010db You already planned the perfect moment during the party to make the grand announcement to everypony about your plan. Brava, Twilight! I can't wait to tell your plan to Fluttershy and the others!
701000 [zap]
701003 Discord, no!
701000 [door creaks]
701005 Twilight, are you reading during a party... again?
701000 [papers rustling]
701003 No, no, no! She's already good at that! She mastered this! She taught me about this one!
701005 Wild guess – something's wrong.
701003 Spike, I'm a terrible mentor! Why didn't I come up with a path for Starlight? Princess Celestia had it all figured out for me! [gasps] That's it! [excited squeal]
701005 Whoa!
701003 I had years worth of friendship lessons ready to go, but when we were captured by Chrysalis, Starlight took charge and really stepped up. I don't think friendship lessons are enough for her anymore.
701019 So you have an overachieving student. Sounds familiar.
701005 [chuckles]
701003 That's why I had to talk to you. You, of all ponies, would know what to do. I mean, you were me and I was Starlight. But, for now, I need you to pretend you're you and I'm me.
701005 Huh?
701019 Heh. Go on.
701003 When I was your student, and you were in this place, you— Oh, no! You sent me to Ponyville! Which means it's time for me to send Starlight Glimmer away!
701003 I can't believe it! It's really time for Starlight to go, isn't it?
701019 Only you can make that decision. It's a difficult one, but your heart knows what's right, even as it hurts.
701005 Where're you gonna send her? Uh, too soon?
701003 No. This is something I have to do. Oh, boy.
70100e Oh, boy!
7010db Whatever Twilight's planning for Starlight is going to be so exciting!
701008 Hmm. Wonder why she didn't tell any of us about it.
7010db Probably because you're not as close as you think you are. [laughs] Just kidding. She wanted it to be a big surprise. Just between us, she's getting ready to make a big announcement!
701007 [squeals] That's so exciting! And surprising. Usually, you tell your party planner about all your plans for your party.
70100c Well, she definitely has one. I mean when has Twilight not had a plan?
701003 [low muttering] Gosh, I don't know... I just don't want to send her to the wrong place... [sighs] I just, I just don't know... [gasps] I got it! Since defeating Chrysalis, Starlight's given the changelings an opportunity to revolutionize their society. Maybe I can send her there.
701000 [magic sounds]
701005 Cool spell.
701003 If Starlight goes to the changeling hive, she can help them adjust to their new way of life.
70127c Okay, Friendship 101. Thorax and I are going to show you how to compromise.
701361 [stiltedly] I want to have honeysuckle nectar for lunch.
70127c [stiltedly] I would like a sandwich. Oh, no. What should we do?
70139d Attack! The winner gets to choose!
701000 [changelings clamoring in agreement]
70127c Or... Thorax and I can talk about it and come up with a solution that works for everypony.
701361 [stiltedly] Starlight, how do you feel about honeysuckle and peanut butter sandwiches?
70127c [stiltedly] Why, that sounds dee-licious!
70139b Compromise.
701000 [changelings clamoring in agreement]
701005 Uh, this doesn't seem like something Starlight and Thorax would do.
701019 Uh, this is Twilight's fantasy, Spike. There is no wrong way to fantasize.
701003 Thank you.
70139d Starlight Glimmer is a most apt and perspicacious pony!
701005 Yep. Definitely a Twilight fantasy.
701019 This seems like a lovely path for Starlight. The changelings have so much to learn about how to enjoy love through friendships. Starlight would be busy for a very long time, but her work there would be very rewarding.
701003 Or dangerous. It would only take one changeling to deviate from the pack.
701000 [transformation noise]
70139e [evil laugh] Hi, I'm Starlight Glimmer! What's your name?
70139f Uh, Cornicle?
70139e [laughs] What kind of name is that? Ah, your wings are so, um... see-through. I'm so glad I'm a pony. Are you, like, bugs, or what?
701000 [zap]
701000 [swat, swat, swat]
70139f [gasps] There she is! Get her!
701000 [changelings clamoring angrily]
701005 Uh, that probably won't happen.
701003 But it could! I can't just send her off to Celestia-knows-where without thinking it through!
701019 Hmm. I was not aware that I was an expression. An appropriate one, of course, for even I don't know the answer. This is a momentous decision. You must consider all the possibilities.
701003 Rethink, rethink, rethink! What about the dragons? I can send Starlight to the Dragon Lands! She and Ember would totally hit it off!
701000 [magic sounds]
701000 [teleportation zap]
70127c Ember!
701328 Starlight!
7013a0 [grunt]
701328 You ready to do some death-defying dragon stuff?
70127c Ah, totally!
701005 Okay, that doesn't sound anything like Ember or Starlight.
701003 Who knows what their dynamic would be, Spike?
701000 [zaps and torches]
701005 [gasps]
701000 [tap, tap]
701005 Freaky.
701003 Starlight will love it in the Dragon Lands. In her letters, Ember said dragons do a lot of fun things. The Feast of Fire, the Dragon Bowl, Claw-chella.
70127c Whoo! [laughs]
701003 Starlight could be there for a really long time. But then again, not all dragons like ponies as much as Ember does.
701170 Hey, Twinkle Star!
70127c It's, uh, Starlight Glimmer.
701170 Star-kle Light-star?
70127c Starlight. Glimmer.
701170 Yeah, whatever. You wanna hang with us?
701000 [whoosh]
70127c What are we diving into?
701170 Lava!
70127c What?!
701005 Twilight, this is crazy!
701000 [magic sounds]
701005 Starlight's really good with magic. She could just stop herself from falling into a pit of lava.
701003 What if she didn't realize it was happening?! You just never know, Spike! I just need to think of someplace safe to send her! Someplace safe, someplace safe, someplace safe... I could send her to the Crystal Empire to continue her magical studies with Sunburst!
701000 [magic sounds]
701003 It'll be perfect! Sunburst's knowledge of magic is only matched by Starlight's abilities.
701315 I've got it! Try placing your horn directly on the potion and picture the clock you wish to make.
701000 [magic noises]
701000 [dong, cuckoo, dong, cuckoo]
701003 They could challenge each other into becoming the most talented unicorns Equestria's ever seen!
70127c We did it! Quick, what's next?
701003 Of course, the study of magic is a lifelong pursuit, and Starlight could be there for a while, especially once they start attempting the really complicated stuff!
701005 Three, two, one...
701003 What if they become too ambitious?!
70127c I never would've thought to combine Star Swirl's apparition spell with Spacium Flexibus! But what would happen if we added Somnambula's Tempus Objectus?
701315 If we do it just right, it should allow us to materialize an object that was lost in the past.
701000 [chalk drawing]
701003 No! Don't do it!
701000 [whoosh!]
70127c [screams]
701315 [screams]
70127c [screams]
7013a1 Starlight, noooooo!
701005 Twilight, snap out of it!
701000 [magic sounds]
701005 Easy, Twilight. It didn't happen.
701003 But it could! I just don't think I can send her anywhere. What am I gonna do?
701019 [laughs heartily]
701003 Are you laughing at me?
701019 [continues laughing]
701003 I can't believe you're laughing at me.
701019 Oh, Twilight, I'm not. I'm laughing because I had the exact same fears you're having.
701003 What?!
701019 Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a very bright young filly.
701019 [voiceover] She was truly one of my best students.
701005 [voiceover] Are you talking about Twilight? I can't see what you're thinking about.
701019 [voiceover] Yes, Spike. I was constantly surprised and impressed with her discoveries. But I noticed that her pursuit of academia was preventing her from reaching her full potential.
701005 [voiceover] You mean it was keeping her isolated and alone?
701019 [voiceover] Uh, yes, Spike. I had a decision to make. Oh, but it wasn't easy.
701019 Maybe I could close the library or throw a party in the castle. Oh, she'd have to talk to the other fillies then! Oh. I must send her away.
701019 [voiceover] I knew there was a special group of fillies in Ponyville, but I kept inventing all kinds of reasons why I shouldn't send you.
701019 What if she runs into a manticore? Or what if she gets pulled into Tartarus? Or, worst of all, what if she doesn't get along with anypony?!
7010a9 Are we supposed to say something?
7010aa I don't think so.
701019 [voiceover] I kept you in Canterlot longer than I should have.
701019 Eventually, I realized all the anxiety I felt was because I didn't want you to go.
701003 Really?
701019 I loved having you as a student. You challenged me and taught me just as much as I taught you. I am embarrassed to admit it, but I was afraid if you made friends, you wouldn't need me anymore.
701003 Princess Celestia, that is so not true. I will always need you.
701019 I think Starlight Glimmer might feel the same way about you. If that is what you're afraid of.
701003 Maybe it is. Just a little.
701005 [chuckles] Oh, it definitely is. Like, a lot.
701019 Here we are after all these years, Twilight. We are living proof that letting someone spread their wings doesn't mean you no longer have a place in their lives.
701003 Thank you.
701019 And if you're still worried, you can always make her write you letters.
701005 [chuckles]
701000 [ponies conversing]
701000 [spotlight turns on]
701000 [boom mic bump]
7010db I may have let it slip that you'd be unveiling your big plan for Starlight tonight. Silly me. But we're all very excited to hear what you've cooked up.
701000 [beat]
7010db You weren't coming up with a plan just now, were you? Oh, dear. This could be pretty embarrassing for you.
701003 [sarcastically] Gee, thanks, Discord.
7010db Anytime. I really do love being helpful.
701000 [zap]
701000 [clink, clink, clink]
701003 If I could have everypony's attention! As you all know, Starlight Glimmer's been my pupil for a while now, and I'd hoped she'd be my pupil for a long time yet to come. But it turns out that's just not meant to be.
701000 [ponies gasp]
701003 Starlight, you have proved yourself to be a kind, loyal, strong, honest, and truly magical friend. Just looking around this room at all the new friendships you've made, I know there's nothing more I need to teach you. So we have a second reason to celebrate today. Three cheers for Starlight Glimmer on her graduation day!
701000 [ponies cheering]
701007 [squeals, giggles] What a great surprise!
701003 [to Starlight] The future's in your own hooves now.
70127c Wow. I was not expecting this!
701395 Mmm... [giggles]
7010db Darn it. I was hoping you would send her to my realm. We could've been roomies. Way to not pick up what I was putting down.
701037 How do you want to celebrate? Girls' trip to Las Pegasus?
701361 We could throw you a changeling Gorbfest! Uh, it's more fun than it sounds.
701000 [tap, tap]
7010db Or we could go cause a little mischief. I know a trick that'll turn Celestia's castle into cheese. Do you think it's a "gouda" idea? [laughs] That's just the first of many cheese jokes if we go down this path.
70127c Well, that all sounds wonderful. But, um, give me a minute, would ya?
701049 [giggling]
701003 Congratulations.
70127c Thanks.
701003 So how do you feel?
70127c Happy, surprised, overwhelmed. I mean, not that I'm not grateful, but are you sure?
701003 Believe me. I've thought long and hard about this.
70127c Of course you did.
701003 Starlight, trust me. You're ready.
70127c Yeah!
701000 [beat]
70127c No, I'm not.
701003 What are you talking about?
70127c I'm not ready to leave!
701003 Oh, good! 'Cause I'm not ready for that either! Here! I got you this present. It was going to be a "congrats on getting a medal of honor" present, but then I was afraid it would have to be a going-away present, but now it's an "I couldn't be happier you're staying" present! It fits perfectly over your dresser! I know. I measured.
70127c Thank you.
701003 I may not know what comes next for you, but whatever it is, I promise I'll always be there for you.
70127c Oh.
701003 Oh.
701000 [indistinct conversations]
701000 [whoosh]
701000 [wheeling in]
701000 [vacuum whirring]
701007 Phee-yew!
701000 [end credits]
702037 Come on, come on! Turn into a teacup!
702000 [magic zap]
702037 No! Teacup!
702000 [magic zap]
702037 No! Teacup!
702000 [magic zap]
702037 [screeching] No! [normally] Oh, Starlight! I can't put a trick that's not working into my act! How come it's not working?
70227c It could be because you're just yelling "teacup!" and not picturing it in your mind.
702037 Oh. Yeah, that could be it.
70227c What does your teacup look like? What shape is it? What color?
702037 [inhales]
702000 [magic zaps]
702037 Whoo! Starlight, I did it!
702000 [splurt]
702037 Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I did it, I did it, I did it! Woo-hoo-hoo!
70227c Hey!
702037 Teacup! [giggles] Teacup! Teacup, teacup, teacup! Tea-cup! Teacup, teacup, tea-cup! You know what you need? A teacup!
702000 [splat]
702000 [teacup poodle yapping]
70227c [groans]
702037 Whoops! I guess I pictured a teacup poodle? Heh.
70227c Trixie! You ruined my teacakes!
702037 I just got excited! This is the first time I did a transfiguration spell! Real magic! Come on! Be impressed by me! [as Starlight Glimmer] "Yay, Trixie! You're so great at magic and having good hair!"
70227c [chuckles] Good job, Trix. But I was baking these to give to Twilight and the girls for their friendship retreat. Pinkie Pie gave me a recipe and everything.
702037 Oh! You need some snacks to give to Twilight? I've got you covered. [humming to herself]
702000 [splat]
702037 Problem solved.
702000 [magic rumbling]
70227c [exhales] Not exactly.
702000 [theme song]
702000 [train whistle blows]
702003 I am so excited for this friendship retreat! I can't remember the last time we all got to hang out without having to save Equestria.
70200c Well, we are awesome. But technically, we weren't the last ponies to save Equestria.
702003 I was speaking in a broader sense. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?
702005 Yeah, I have three new comics to get through.
70227c And I promised Trixie we'd practice more magic. It might be better if the castle was empty, if you know what I mean.
702037 [groans] Relax. If anything breaks, Starlight will just go back in time and fix it!
70227c [nervous laughter]
702037 Kidding.
70227c We'll take good care of the castle while you're gone.
702037 Have fun on your friendship retreat! [hushed, to Starlight] What in Equestria is a friendship retreat, anyway?
70227c [hushed] They're gonna bond, share laughs, and if I know them, they're gonna sing a song.
702037 [giggles] We are gonna have so much more fun than them!
70227c [giggles] Shhh!
702037 Twilight, wait! Starlight has something for you!
702003 Huh?
70227c [nervously] Here, I, um, brought you snacks...
702003 Oh, how... thoughtful, thanks. We will... not get hungry on the train.
70227c It was supposed to be teacakes, but... [sighs] it's a long story. Have a great time!
702003 You, too!
702000 [door shuts]
702000 [train rattling]
70227c Okay, Trixie, what kinds of spells did you want to work on next?
702037 Well, every self-respecting magician has a disappearing act, so maybe we could start with that?
70227c Hmmm. Nothing just disappears, so that's technically a teleportation spell, and those are pretty hard. Maybe we should start with something smaller.
702037 No-no-no-no. The Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie goes big or not at all! Just tell me how you do it.
70227c Well, I've always found magic is tied to my emotions. Whatever I'm feeling fuels whatever I'm doing, and the stronger I'm feeling, the stronger the magic.
702037 Right. Like when you were so upset that cutie marks took away your friend, your magic was strong enough to enslave an entire village.
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c Yep. Thanks for bringing that up.
702037 See? I'm already learning. If anypony is gonna teach me how to do a disappearing spell—
70227c Teleportation spell.
702037 Whatever. I'm complimenting you. And me. We can do this, 'cause we're amazing, and magic is friendship and stuff.
70227c [laughs] I guess we can give it a whirl. Now, we just need to find you something to teleport.
702037 Spike! How about it?
702005 [nervous laugh]
70227c Uh, let's pick something, I don't know, not living?
702037 I mean it won't be as impressive, but okay. Teach away, mini-Twilight.
70227c [groans]
7023a2 [bored] Welcome to Manehattan Escapes.
70200d Ooh, I'm going to start with a facial, and then get my hooves done, and—
702003 Oh, it's not that kind of retreat.
70200d Isn't it called "Manehattan Escapes" because it's a deluxe spa where you can escape all of your troubles?
702003 Nope! It's because we get locked in a room and we have to solve puzzles and riddles in order to escape!
7023a2 [bored] The clues will lead you to a key to get out.
702003 Team-building!
70228c [sighs]
702008 Come on, girls. This could be fun.
702003 Could be? Some of the brightest minds in Equestria put together these puzzles!
70200e I'm just happy to be with all of you.
702007 Me, too! I'm not great at solving riddles, but I'm super great at cheering other ponies on while they do it! Go, us! Ooo, ooo! Woo-hoo!
70200d Yes, yes, woo-hoo. [clears throat] But just so we know, exactly how long will we be locked in here?
7023a2 [bored] A group of griffons set the record for the fastest escape. It only took them an hour.
70200c Hah! Griffons barely like each other! We're basically the poster ponies for amazing friendships! So get your quill ready, bub! You're gonna have to write down a new record!
70227c If you master this spell before the girls get back, you'd be setting some kind of record!
702037 Challenge accepted!
70227c Okay. What you want to do is concentrate on the object that you want to teleport...
702005 Yeah, I'm gonna go... all the way over here.
702037 Concentrate on teleporting. Got it. Doin' the spell!
70227c No, Trix, wait, not just—
702000 [magic zap]
70227c [groans]
702000 [thud]
702037 [weakly] Ta-da.
70227c [hyperventilating] No-no-no-no-no-no-no! You made Twilight's friendship map disappear!
702037 [clears throat] Teleport.
70227c Really?!
702037 Well, it was behind the apple. It was bound to happen. On the plus side, my magic is getting better! I made a whole table go poof! That was pretty impressive!
70227c Trixie, we have to get that map back.
702037 We'll find it. No big deal.
70227c Twilight's never gonna trust me to be alone in this castle again! What were you thinking?!
702037 Teleport, like you told me to.
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c No! You're supposed to concentrate on the object, not just teleporting!
702037 [scoffs] Well, gee, you probably should have told me all the steps before you let me do the spell.
70227c I tried. [gasps] I... need a minute.
702000 [dishes clattering]
702000 [door opens]
702000 [crockery shattering]
702005 Hey, are you okay?
70227c I will be once I cast a spell to contain my anger in this bottle.
702005 Wait, what?
70227c Do you see this storm cloud? This has never happened before! All this magical energy has to go somewhere, and if I'm not using it to fight a magical duel or bend my friends' wills to obey my every command...
702005 Hah. I remember that.
70227c The point is, I don't know what my magic's going to do. So I'm hoping if I bottle up my anger, I won't do who-knows-what to Trixie.
702005 Are you sure that's a good idea?
70227c What choice do I have? I've got to get that map back, and I don't wanna lose Trixie. If she knew what I was thinking right now, she'd probably never talk to me again.
702005 Okay... You do what you need to do. I'll see if I can find the map somewhere in the castle.
70227c Trixie!
702037 Oh, there you are! For a minute, I didn't think you were coming back, and that you might be upset with me for some weird reason. But then I remembered – you never get mad at me.
70227c [groans]
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c [exhales] Nope! [laughs nervously] Not mad at all! So, the map is probably in the last place you were thinking of. Where was that?
702037 Ooh, great question. I wish you'd asked it, like, right after I did the spell. I don't remember anymore.
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c [groans] No worries. We'll just take a walk around town. Maybe that'll jog your memory.
702037 Okay, that sounds fun. Ooh!
70227c Did you remember?
702037 Nope! But I did think we could stop for cinnamon nuts while we're out!
70227c Cinnamon... nuts?
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c That's a good idea!
702037 Yes! I've been craving something sweet since I couldn't have any teacakes this morning.
70227c [exhales] You got this, Starlight...
702007 Woo-hoo! Go, Twilight! you can do it!
702000 [click, rattling]
702007 Woo-hoo!
702008 Hoo-wee! You solved that triangley thing mighty fast! Uh, does anypony need a purple jewel?
70200d Ooh! Plum or boysenberry?
702008 Don't both those fruits mean purple?
70200d Yes, but one's a lovely purple and one's... well, icky.
70200c [groans] Just put the gem in! We're trying to set a record here!
702000 [clunking]
702007 [cheer-singing] Yay! We solved another clue, 'cause our friendship is so true! Yaaaay, us! Woo-hoo!
702037 [chewing]
7023a3 Ah, hello, fillies. Uh, how can I help you? Oh, are those cinnamon nuts?
702037 Mmm, yes. I got them from the cart outside. They're delicious. Do you want some?
70227c Have you seen a big table? Magical map on it, sometimes glowing cutie marks shoot out?
7023a3 [stuttering] A big ta— Uh, no! Uh, why in Equestria would something like that be in here? Ha.
702037 Well, I cast a pretty amazing spell that transported it to the last place I was thinking of, but I might have been thinking about how I'd treat myself to a nice brooch instead.
7023a3 Ah, well, no huge table here. Uh, are you still interested in that brooch?
702037 Sure!
70227c No! We don't have time for this! Twilight and the girls are gonna be back soon!
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c But I'm not upset. What's our next stop?
702009 Nope, I ain't seen it.
70227c Are you sure? It's really, really important that we find it. And it might be here because somepony...
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c ...was craving apples.
702037 I'm still craving them. They'd go so well with cinnamon nuts!
702009 [sniffs] Oh, them nuts sure do smell good! Heh-heh.
70227c Granny Smith, please. The table?
702009 [confused muttering] Well, my eyes ain't what they used to be, but I'd know for sure if a big ol' table done appeared out of thin air.
70227c [sighs]
702000 [teapot poodle yapping]
702037 Darn. I could've sworn it'd be at the ice cream parlor, because it was warm in the castle and I thought I wanted ice cream, and— Ooh! Maybe we should check out the Crystal Empire, 'cause Twilight's castle is made out of crystals, so I totally had crystals on my mind.
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c [tired] Okay, we better start moving if we want to make it to the Crystal Empire.
702037 Are you okay, Starlight? Because you seem a little, uh, what's the word... "lch-bh-ba".
70227c [groans]
702000 [magic warbling]
70227c [tired] Nope. I am great.
702037 Did your saddlebag just glow?
70227c [weakly] No.
702037 Gimme!
70227c [weakly] No!
702037 Give it here!
70227c [weakly] Don't!
702037 What's in this?
70217b Cinnamon nuts!
702009 Ooh, I have had a hankerin' for these all day!
7023a3 Uh, me, too! Ever since that Trixie came by with 'em.
70232e [straining]
702000 [thud]
702000 [slow motion noise]
702000 [shattering]
702000 [dizzy stars]
702037 Um, why are they looking at me like that...?
70217b [growling]
702037 Whoa!
702009 You ruined my teacakes!
702037 What?! [anxious noises]
7023a3 You just had to give Twilight those smelly pretzels!
702037 Were they your pretzels? I don't understand.
70217b You don't pay attention when I'm trying to teach you!
702037 Starlight, can you help me, please?!
702008 Uh, Twilight, can you help me, please?
702000 [bricks moving]
70200c I've seen those symbols! Over here!
702007 You can do it!
702000 [clanking]
70200d Almost there.
70200e I've got the key!
702003 This is it! I'm so impressed.
70200c I'm not. I knew we were the best!
702009 You're the worst!
702037 That seems harsh.
702009 Hiyaaa!
702037 Whoa! Starlight! [panting] I don't know what's happening! Starlight, help!
702000 [magic fizzling]
70227c I'm glad Twilight isn't here to see this.
702003 I wish that Starlight was here to see how strong friendships can be when we trust each other and work together! You've all taught me so much.
702003 [Twilight Sparkle]
702003 Friendship used to make me so queasy, queasy
702003 But you made it all so easy, easy
702003 Now I don't have to say what I'm thinking
702003 You already know without even blinking
702008 [Applejack]
702008 You girls are the apple of my eye
70200c [Rainbow Dash]
70200c The race that doesn't end in a tie
702007 [Pinkie Pie]
702007 You are the funnel cake at my fair
70200e [Fluttershy]
70200e The warm hug of a fuzzy bear
702012 [Mane Six]
702012 Best friends until the end of time
702012 We'll have each other's backs
702012 And let our true selves shine
702012 And that's because everything we need is all right here
702012 When we're with our team
702037 Starlight! A spark of magic could be very helpful right about now!
70227c [grunting] I can't...!
702003 [Twilight Sparkle]
702003 I simply can't imagine there'd be a day
702003 Where I wouldn't want to be walking your way
702003 Whatever new problems there may be, may be
702003 Our friendship is always the door with a key
70200d [Rarity]
70200d You are the jewels in my friendship crown
702003 [Twilight Sparkle]
702003 The sparks that make my world go 'round
702012 [Mane Six]
702012 We bring the best out, that's our goal
702012 There's no telling how far we'll go
702012 Best friends until the end of time
702012 We'll have each other's backs
702012 And let our true selves shine
702012 And that's because everything we need is all right here
702012 When we're with our team!
7023a2 That was lovely. But, um, you know the game isn't over until you turn that key?
702000 [ding]
70200c Gah!
702000 [thud]
70200c [panting] Did we do it?
702000 [buzz]
7023a2 So close. You missed the griffon record by two seconds. Probably shouldn't have sung that song.
70200c Aw, nuts!
70217b [screaming]
702037 Nuts!
702000 [crash]
70217b You just do whatever you want to do!
702037 Starlight!
702009 And you don't always... [pants] ...have to bring up my dark past!
702037 I didn't know you had one, Granny Smith!
702009 [grunts]
7023a3 Oh! I just can't believe you sometimes! You make me so mad!
702037 I barely even know you! I don't understand why you're all so mad at me!
70227c [weakly] They're not. I am.
702000 [magic warbling and rumbling]
702037 You are?
70227c [sighs] I'm really... mad at you. You lost Twilight's map table. You make jokes like it's no big deal. It's like you don't even care you could get me in a lot of trouble. If we can't find that table, Twilight's never going to trust me again, and the worst part is you didn't even say you were sorry!
702037 I... I-I'm sorry. I had no idea you felt that way.
70227c Yeah! I do! [sighs] But to be fair, I don't know how you could have known. I did a spell and bottled up my anger, but when the bottle broke, it infected these three. I'm really sorry. I used magic so I wouldn't use magic. I should have guessed that would backfire.
7023a3 Aw, that's all right. It was a slow day.
702009 Yeah, I was gonna get my dentures cleaned before y'all showed up.
70217b Ah! Oh, no! My nut cart!
702000 [magic humming]
70217b Yay! My nut cart!
7023a3 Uh, hang on. Don't you work at the spa?
70217b [gasps] I'm late for my other job! What? I wear many hats.
702000 [cart squeaking]
702037 Not gonna lie. Hearing you and those random ponies say all those terrible things about me wasn't easy. But I needed to hear it. Why didn't you just tell me how you felt?
70227c I didn't want to lose you as a friend.
702037 Pfft! Come on! It'd take a lot more than that to lose me. Our friendship is stronger than a few angry words.
70227c And a magical temper tantrum?
702037 Listen, I'd take that over the boring pony you were becoming any day. The Starlight I love is passionate, lively, and yeah, sometimes angry. Those are my favorite parts of you. That and the fact that you forgive me every time.
70227c [giggles] I'll forgive you if you forgive me.
702037 Deal. [gasps] I remembered what I was thinking about!
702000 [bell rings]
70227c You're kidding me.
702037 There's more to it than that. I was thinking about how glad I am to have met you, and I remembered our first meeting – here at the Ponyville spa. And now I just have to teleport it back!
70227c No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
702000 [thud]
702005 A little to the left. Oh, now rotate it just a hair...
702000 [door opens]
702003 Hey, girls! How'd it go?
702000 [loud thud]
70232e [simultaneously] Nothing!
702003 ...What?
70227c Let's just say I learned a friendship lesson while you were gone.
702003 You've barely graduated, and you're already taking initiative! [tearing up] Oh... So proud...
70200e We learned about team building and problem solving...
702007 And when not to sing songs!
70200d We certainly had a good time, but I really was looking forward to a spa day, and the Ponyville spa's still open. Anyone?
702003 Sounds good to me!
70200c [simultaneously] I have a coupon!
70211a [simultaneous agreement]
702037 We'll meet you there! [to Starlight] Quick! Do you have a spell that will make the spa ponies forget that the map table was there?
70227c Haven't you learned anything about using magic to solve your problems?
702037 No. If we learned that lesson, how will we ever have fun?
70232e [giggling]
702000 [end credits]
70302c Oh, Princess Twilight! Everypony in the hospital is so excited for your visit today!
703003 I'm never too busy to visit sick foals. I can't believe a whole class just came down with the horsey hives!
70302c On school picture day, too.
703000 [camera clicks]
70302c Oh, the poor dears really do need cheering up.
703003 We'll do our best. We'll bring snacks, I'll read to them, and get them gifts!
703005 Food and presents always cheer me up.
703000 [door opens]
703003 We'll see you soon!
703000 [door closes]
703005 Okay, if we want to be at the hospital by lunch, then we have three hours to buy get-well presents, borrow a book from the schoolhouse, [sighing] and pick up treats.
703003 It's a lot, but if we stick to the schedule, I know we can get it all done.
703005 Yeah, knock on wood.
703000 [knocking]
703000 [door opens]
703193 Surprise!
703319 [giggles]
703003 [gasps] Oh, my gosh! How's my favorite niece?
703193 [as Flurry Heart] "I'm good! I was hoping my favowite aunt could watch me for a few houwrs."
703198 Hope you're not too busy.
703005 Actually, we kind of are— [suddenly muffled]
703003 Busy? [scoffs] Would the best aunt ever be too busy to spend time with this adorable little one?
703000 [pause]
703003 No!
703000 [theme song]
703003 [multiple kisses]
703319 [giggling]
703003 [blows raspberry] Flurry! I've got a surprise for you!
703000 [thump]
703003 Just a couple of toys that reminded me of Flurry.
703000 [door opens]
703000 [rattling]
703003 [gasps]
703319 [giggles]
703003 I'm excited to show you I've done some shopping for Flurry Heart.
703198 Oh-ho-ho, you're so sweet. You didn't have to do all that.
703003 I know, but I can't help myself! Best aunt ever! Open this one, Flurry.
703319 [baby noise] [giggles] [growls like a bear] [giggles]
703003 Exactly! They're bears! You're one smart cookie. [making sound effects to elegant music]
703319 [giggles]
703000 [somewhat less elegant music]
703000 [alternating elegant and less elegant music stings]
703193 We'll just put Flurry's things over here, Twily!
703003 Uh-huh. Totally.
703193 Mashed peas, her favorite.
703198 And diapers. Uh, extra diapers. Oh, and backup extra diapers. Heh.
703193 Mashed peas, her favorite. Wait, did I say that already?
703000 [thump]
703005 Uh-huh.
703193 Oops.
703198 Oh, and this is the most important thing of all – her Whammy.
703005 I take it Flurry named it?
703198 Yup. If she gets fussy, just give her the Whammy and she'll calm right down.
703193 You getting all this, Twily?
703003 Whammy. Got it. Where are you guys headed, anyway?
703193 You remember my friend from the royal guard, Spearhead?
703000 [beat]
703005 Honestly, all of your friends' names are very similar.
703193 Well, he has a pop-up art show at the Ponyville Cafe, and we decided to go at the last minute.
703198 We're not exactly art enthusiasts, but we could really use a night out.
703005 You mean "day"?
703198 That's what I said! Isn't that what I said?
703005 Mmm... Mm-mm.
703198 Either way, are you sure you can watch her?
703005 Uh-uh-uh!
703003 Mmmmh...
703319 [squeaks]
703003 Have no fear! The best aunt ever has everything under control!
7031a5 [kissing]
703193 Thanks again, Twily.
703005 Okay, let's grab that Whummy thing and go.
703000 [magic zap]
703319 Uh-uh! [growls like a bear]
703003 Oh, you want to pretend we're the bears. I suppose we have time for a quick game.
703005 Do we, though?
703319 [giggling]
703003 Hey! All right! [growls like a bear] I'm gonna get ya!
703000 [toy squeaking]
703005 Ugh! [sighs] You should catch her soon, 'cause we've got lots to do! Horsey-hives-covered foals counting on us, remember?
703003 Got it! [growls like a bear] I'm catching up!
703319 [happy squeals]
703003 [growls like a bear]
703319 Huh?
703003 [roars like a bear]
703319 [squeaks]
703003 Uh-oh. Sorry, bug. Did that scare you? It's okay. It's just Auntie Twily!
703319 [blows raspberry] Bleh!
703003 You know, that was a very advanced spell for somepony your age. Looks like you're already taking after your Auntie Twily.
703005 All right, that was pretty adorable. But now...
703003 I know, Spike, we're leaving.
703319 [stomach grumbles]
703003 I just have to feed her real quick.
703319 [blows raspberry]
703000 [splat]
703193 Is this art or... a mistake?
703198 I have no idea. But who cares? We're not changing diapers.
7032d5 Shining Armor! Cadance! How are the new 'rents? Gimme some hoof. Oh, it is so [grunt] good [grunt] to see you dudes! Hey, thanks for coming.
703193 Of course! We're having a great time! Loving all the... art!
7032d5 Uh, that's a trash can.
703193 So it is! I knew that!
7032d5 But hey, who's to say it's not art? Art can be anything that speaks to you. It changed my world. This is my latest piece – "A Thousand Nights in a Hallway".
703198 Wow, I guess nighttime in a hallway can be pretty dark.
7032d5 [seriously] There is none more dark.
703193 [baffled] Yeah. Totally.
703198 We're just so happy to be here. Usually we're covered in mashed peas by now.
703005 When they said mashed peas were her favorite...
703000 [splat]
703319 [giggles]
703005 ...did they mean her favorite thing to decorate a room with?!
703319 [giggles]
703000 [splat]
703003 Aw, come on, Spike. That wasn't too bad.
703005 Yeah, and we're only twenty minutes behind schedule.
703003 Twenty minutes?! [exhales] It's fine. We can totally do this.
703000 [splat]
703003 [embarrassed giggle]
703000 [doors open]
703003 Okay, we just need to grab some toys and we are outta here.
703000 [shopping cart squeaking]
703319 [roars like a bear]
703003 You want to play, don't you? Well, I know a game that's even more fun! [aside to Spike] And more efficient. [to Flurry Heart] Playing race carts! Ha-ha!
703319 [giggling]
703003 Woo-hoo!
703000 [tires squealing]
703005 [panting] [out of breath] Hey, nice thinking, Twilight!
703003 Best aunt ever! Hang on, Flurry. The race cart's taking a pit stop.
703319 [giggles]
703000 [cart rattling]
703319 [giggling]
703000 [thud]
703005 I'm not a detective, but I think we got a suspect.
703003 Huh?! [sighs] Well, we'd better get to cleaning. We've got no time to waste!
703353 Thanks, but they were organized by color.
703003 [snorts, sighs]
703003 [panting]
703000 [tires squealing]
703003 [panting] Yes! We gained back a whole five minutes from running here!
703005 Yeah, but if you add that to the forty minutes we were already behind... we're still... fifty five minutes behind!
703000 [beat]
703005 I mean... [nervous chuckle] Yay, team?
703003 Mm-hmm!
703003 Thanks for helping us out, Cheerilee. Sorry we were late.
70305b Oh, no problem. But I gotta say, I'm surprised you came to me for a book. Don't you have a huge collection?
703003 Yes, but—
703319 [giggling]
703000 [stroller springs squeaking]
703003 Sorry, one second.
703319 [annoyed grunt] [giggling]
703003 I didn't think the foals would be interested in The Unabridged History of Amulets in pony Latin.
70305b Yeah, it was good you came to me. How about the complete collection of Ponyville Fables and Stables?
703003 Mmm, too long.
70305b Alien Alicorns vs. Space Pirates?
703003 Well, the science there is preposterous—
703005 How about Burnferno, Warrior from Within? It's about a handsome dragon warrior who slays evildoers with his breath and his snappy comebacks!
703003 [giggles] Let's borrow that for you and keep looking.
703005 Eh.
703003 What else?
703000 [Whammy squeaks]
703319 [giggles]
703000 [magic zap]
70305b Uh, how about Gusty the Great?
703003 Ooh, that was one of my favorites when I was a filly! We'll take it!
70305b [teeth chattering]
703003 Mm, should I go with something more current...? [gasps]
703319 Ta-da!
703003 Cheerilee, I am so, so sorry! I didn't even hear her leave!
703000 [erasing noises]
703319 [worried noise]
703003 There, all clean.
70305b Great. Now I'll just write it up again...! [slightly muffled] With my mouth.
703003 Ehh...
7032d5 Feast your eyes. This one's called "A Kitchen Guard's Journey"!
703198 [unsure] Oh...
703193 This reminds me of the time Flurry got into the chocolate pudding, and we found little chocolate hoofprints all over the carpet.
703198 That took forever to clean up! But remember how cute her little face looked when we caught her?
703193 Yeah. She was like, [imitating Flurry Heart] "Uh-oh!"
7031a5 [laughing]
7032d5 Whoa, art is so evocative! I wasn't even going for that memory! Score!
703000 [stroller squeaking]
703005 Honestly, Twilight, I don't even want to tell you how late we are. Should I just cancel our visit to the hospital?
703003 What?! Cancel?! We can't cancel, Spike! The sick foals are counting on us! And the B.A.E. would never throw in the towel like that!
703005 B.A.E.?
703003 "Best Aunt Ever"? Besides, this errand is gonna be different.
703005 How do you figure that?
703003 Because Flurry can play with the Cake twins and stay out of trouble! Best aunt ever!
70313a [giggling] [suddenly shuts up]
7033a4 [baby noises]
703003 Wonderful! They're friends already!
703000 [toy squeaks]
703005 Huh. I shouldn't have doubted you.
703003 Thanks! Wait, you doubted me?
703005 [nervous squeak]
703003 Spike, you watch Flurry. I'll take care of everything else. [quickly, to Pinkie Pie] Hi, Pinkie! How's it going? I need to pick up the cupcakes for the foals at the hospital! And can you do apology treats?
703007 I'm good. Here they are. Of course I can!
703003 Do you still have a giant file on everypony's favorite treat?
703007 In my secret party planning cave!
703000 [ding!]
703007 BRB!
703000 [papers rustling]
703003 Hee-hee! Remind me to tell you later how amazing you are. Cheerilee?
703007 Eh. I am pretty awesome.
703000 [paper rustling]
703007 Cherry oatmeal cookies with yellow sprinkles.
703003 Great! Can you write "sorry" on them?
703007 I've got a stamp for that!
703000 [stamp]
7033a5 [arguing baby noises]
703005 Hey, you guys! No need to fight! Uh... Hang on! I'm sure there's another one! Ugh, no, not this one... Oh, that's cute...
703000 [toys thudding and squeaking]
7033a5 [screaming]
703000 [thud]
703003 Hold on, sweetie. We'll play in a second.
703000 [snap]
703000 [magic noises]
703003 The salespony at the toy store...
703007 Apple strudel cupcake with caramel drizzle!
7033a5 [grunts]
703319 [yelps]
703000 [splat]
7033a5 [grunts]
703000 [splat]
703007 [noise of alarm]
703000 [paper ripping]
703003 Oh, no. You're making the same face Cheerilee made. Pinkie, remind me what your favorite treat is.
703007 Mmm... The sampler platter.
703003 We'll take three of those.
703005 Aha! Told you I'd find another one. [gasps]
703000 [balloon pops]
703005 [chuckles nervously]
703000 [splat]
703005 Uh... Twilight?
703003 Out of the question! We are not cancelling! It's going to be okay! It has to be okay! It's been so terrible so far it can't possibly end up— Oh...
703000 [squirt]
703005 Uh, sorry.
703003 [sighs] No, I needed it.
703005 I was just gonna say, we're here.
703000 [tires screeching]
703005 And we're only four-and-a-half minutes late!
703003 Four and a half?!
703003 [reading] "...and while nopony had ever tried to reach Cloudsdale on hoof, Gusty the Great was not deterred! She and her unicorn warriors marched up the hill. But suddenly, they encountered..."
703005 [gasps] What?! What was it?!
703003 "It was the treacherous Grogar..."
703319 [baby noises underneath]
703003 "...and Gusty could tell he was ready for battle. Gusty called out to the unicorn warriors—" Ow! Not right now, Flurry. These foals really want to hear this.
703000 [kettle whistling]
703319 [throws tantrum]
703000 [Whammy squeaking]
703003 [reading] "'We can fight Grogar together!' And the unicorn warriors shot magical beams into the clouds that wove into one! The beam, stronger than a thousand armies, shined down!"
703000 [magic zaps under]
703003 [reading] "It wrapped around Grogar and pulled him to the ground! 'Don't let him escape!', yelled Gusty!"
703319 [worried squeaks]
703000 [magic zaps]
70302c Say 'ah'.
7030be Ahhh—

703005 You know, her Whacky Whompy thing? The snail? Where is it? Cadance said it calms her down.
703003 I don't see it!

7030f3 [noises of assent]
703000 [thud]
703003 Flurry, that was very, very bad! You could have hurt somepony!
703319 [starts crying]
703003 Oh, Flurry, I didn't mean to—
703319 [continues crying]
703003 Sweetie, you don't have to be scared. It's just me, see?
703319 [confused crying noise]
703003 You're scared of me. Because I yelled at you like a big scary bear. Flurry, I'm so sorry. I've been a terrible aunt today. All you wanted to do was play, and I've barely been able to pay attention to you. None of this is your fault. It's mine. So much for being the best aunt ever. But I hope you know how much I love you.
703319 [giggles]
703003 Oh, I take it you forgive me?
703319 [honk]
703003 Thanks, Flurry. How about we head home? After we find your Whammy, of course.
70302c [clears throat, taps hoof]
703003 And clean up. [embarrassed giggle]
703198 [tearing up] This one kind of reminds me of Flurry's hair.
703193 [tearing up] Uh-huh. And this one reminds me of Flurry too.
7032d5 How so?
703193 It's small... like her! I-I can't do this anymore! Spearhead, this has been great, but—
7032d5 Say no more. My art has always spoken to me about what I love. But knowing that it spoke to you about what you love speaks to me.
703193 What...?
7032d5 Go to her.
7033a7 [giggling]
703000 [magic zap]
703319 [muffled giggling] [unmuffled giggling]
7033a7 [giggling]
703000 [door opens]
703193 Flurry?! Where's our little foal?! Ah! Oh, we missed you so much!
7031a5 [loving chuckles]
703319 [encouraging noises]
7031a5 [sighs]
703198 But it looks like you had a great time without us.
703003 Actually, not so much. Flurry got into some mischief, but it wasn't her fault. I shouldn't have agreed to watch her with such a jam-packed schedule. It was too much to juggle. But Flurry taught me an important lesson today. It turns out being the best aunt ever isn't about spending the most time with your niece, but spending quality time with her. And she taught me a really cool bear game, so I guess I learned two things.
7031a5 [laughing]
703193 Well, we definitely should've given you more of a heads up.
703198 Yes! From now on, we'll give you plenty of notice.
703003 Ohh, that would be great.
703198 Hey, what are you doing next Tuesday?
703003 [surprised snort]
703198 For dinner, not to babysit.
703003 [chuckle] I'll have to check with Spike, but I think we're free.
703198 Where is Spike, anyway?
703005 [reading] "The dashing dragon warrior breathed a scorching flame from his snout, then chuckled to himself as he flew into the sunset. 'If you can't stand the heat, don't fight a dragon!'"

7043a9 So in closing, earning a rocktorate in rock studies from the Equestrian Institute of Rockology is no easy feat. I'm proud of each and every one of you. Uh... each of... No, just you, actually.
704007 Go, Maud! Woo-hoo! Number one! Number one!
7043a9 Fillies and gentlecolts... and is that magnesium-rich basalt? It is my honor to present our vale-rock-torian, Maud Pie. Excuse me. Doctor Pie.
704007 Whoo! Doctor Pie! Doctor Pie! ..."Rock-tor" Pie?
704242 [clears throat]
704000 [microphone feedback]
704242 [deadpan] I'm Maud.
704007 Yeah, you are! Brilliant speech! Encore! Encore!
704242 [deadpan] There's more, Pinkie. I'm Maud. [flips index card] Pie. Thank you.
704000 [camera clicks]
704007 You are so welcome! Brilliant speech! Encore! Encore! Encore!
704000 [clank]
704000 [theme song]
704007 [long high-pitched squeal, rapidly] You're moving to Ponyville! We'll live together and get bunk beds and I'll make us fuzzy slippers that say "Best Sister Friends Forever", although I probably can't fit all those words on a slipper, so maybe just "BSFF", but we don't have to decide right now because we'll be together all the time since when it comes to Ponyville, the doctor is in!
704242 [deadpan] Slow down, Pinkie Pie.
704007 Yooooouuuuu'rrrrrrrreeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmooooooooovvvvvvvviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnggggggg tttttttooooooo Pooooooooooonnnnnnnnyyyyyyyyvvvvvvviiiiiiilllllllleeeeeeeee....
704242 [deadpan] I'm not definitely moving to Ponyville.
704007 Of course you are, silly. You said... [imitating Maud] "There's nothing left to study back home on the rock farm, so I might move to Ponyville." [inflates, pop]
704242 [deadpan] I'm also considering Ghastly Gorge.
704007 [laughs] Classic Maud sense of humor! You should do stand-up!
704242 [deadpan] I do. But that wasn't a joke.
704007 [gasps] Ghastly Gorge? That terrible, awful, no-fun, all-alone canyon in the middle of nowhere?
704242 [deadpan] There or Ponyville.
704007 But Ponyville is so "eee-hee-hee-hee-hee!" and Ghastly Gorge is so "Blegh!"
704242 [deadpan] It's a rock-based decision.
704007 But what about BSFFs?
704242 [deadpan] That's why I'm giving Ponyville a chance.
704007 Phew! So all I have to do is prove Ponyville has better rocks than Ghastly Gorge? Challenge accepted. We'll drop your stuff off at my place, and then hold onto your world, 'cause it's about... to... get... rocked!
704000 [beat]
704242 [deadpan] Okay.
704007 Ghastly Gorge may have rocks, but our gem cave rocks!
704000 [harp glissando]
704007 Huh? Huh? Oh, and look! You'll never know who you'll see!
70400d [gasps] Maud, darling! It's lovely to see you again! Oh! Congratulations on your rocktorate. What are you doing now?
704242 [deadpan] Talking to you.
70400d Oh, y— Right. [laughs, clears throat] Well, if your trained eye happens to see a chartreuse gem, I'm desperate to find one.
704242 [deadpan] I found one.
70400d Oh, you're an absolute darling! This will surely make my gown stand out at Countess Coloratura's album release party. Do you know how rare this is?
704007 Just another day in Ponyville!
704000 [ding]
704242 [deadpan] That's actually a really common gem.
70401e Huh?
704000 [rocks crumbling, gems falling out]
704242 [deadpan] These are all really common gems.
704007 They are? Uh, I mean, heh, come on! Of course they are! That's why I didn't bring you here to impress you! I wanted to make sure you had a chance to, heh, say "hello" to your old pal... Spike!
704242 [deadpan] Hello, Spike.
704007 Way to go, Maud! Cross that off the to-do list! Y'know what I'm sayin'? Check! Now, let's get moving, 'cause I'm about to show you something that'll make you yell "All right!"
704242 [deadpan] All right.
704007 See? Ha-ha!
704007 Ta-da! It's a castle... made of rocks! Whaaaat?! Did I just blow your mind? I think I just blew your mind.
704242 [deadpan] A lot of structures are made from rocks, Pinkie. They're a very stable building material.
704007 But this place grew out of nowhere after a magical key-build gem followed a rainbow and buried itself in the ground! I mean, have you ever seen rocks like this?
704242 [deadpan] Yes.
704007 No, you haven't!
704242 [deadpan] We literally just saw hundreds of them in the gem cave.
704007 But... but... Oh, look at those rocks!
704242 [deadpan] Those are sting-bush seed pods.
704007 So they are! But, uh... look at that rock! It's even got four smaller rocks around it like legs!
704242 [deadpan] That's a tortoise.
704007 Whose side are you on, Tank?! [panicked panting] Oh, wait a minute! What's that?! It's a rock shaped like Lyra Heartstrings! Total rock! [growling]
704000 [deflating]
704007 [sighs] I guess you won't be moving to Ponyville after all. Those rocks at Ghastly Gorge don't know how lucky they are to have you.
704242 [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the only reason I'm considering Ponyville.
704007 You said it's a rock-based decision.
704242 [deadpan] I'm obviously passionate about exotic rocks, but I've always studied them... alone. I could handle some less exciting rocks if it meant I'd have somepony to talk to besides Boulder.
704007 [gasps] Are you saying you want... a friend?!
704242 [deadpan] I wouldn't mind one.
704007 [gasps] Maudileena Daisy Pie, this'll be easy! What're you looking for in a friend? Gimme six qualities assigning each one a numerical importance rating between one and seven, seven being essential and one being "eh". [burps]
704242 [deadpan] It isn't hard to meet somepony I like. It's finding somepony who gets me.
704007 I get you.
704242 [deadpan] You're my sister. It's different.
704007 Maud, you are the best! You never know when the lightning of friendship will strike. Somepony could come barreling through that door at this very moment and become your best friend!
704000 [suspenseful music]
704007 Y'know, I really thought somepony was gonna come barreling through that—
704000 [door opens]
704000 [bump!]
70427c [grunts]
704242 [deadpan] Uh.
70427c Oh, my fault! Totally my fault! Are you okay? I should've been watching where I was going, and— You look really familiar. Have we met before?
704242 [deadpan] Yes.
70427c I knew it!
704007 Whaaaaat?!
70427c No, no, don't tell me. Um...
704007 [squeals]
70427c Yeah. See, I was really hoping you'd tell me while I pretended to remember.
704007 How is this possible? [screams]
704242 [deadpan] I traveled Equestria for my rocktorate dissertation.
704000 [rock breaking]
70427c Psst! Do you know a lot about rocks?
704242 [deadpan] Yes.
70427c Have you ever come across some kind of super-powerful stone that can store the cutie mark magic of... I don't know... an entire village?
704242 [deadpan] Yep. In the big cave.
704007 [laughs] Hey, I got an idea. Let's not tell anypony that part where you maybe, for sure, accidentally helped Starlight enslave a town! [laughs, seriously] Tell nopony!
704242 [deadpan] It's not like she's enslaved anypony lately.
70427c [chuckling weakly, sighs] Well, great seeing you again. I gotta run a few errands. [sighs]
704007 [through the side of her mouth] Offer to help.
704242 [deadpan] What?
704007 Offer to help!
70427c You wanna help?
704242 [deadpan] Do I?
704007 Of course you do! Go!
704242 [deadpan] Okay.
704007 [squeals] They're totally gonna be best friends and then Maud will choose Ponyville, and we'll get to wear BSFF slippers!
704000 [thud]
704000 [Starlight's theme playing]
704242 [deadpan] Rocks take on different properties when interacting with magic. With the right stone, you could rule all of Equestria if you wanted to.
70427c You're messing with me.
704242 [deadpan] Am I?
704000 [grim music]
70427c [laughs, sighs] So other than rocks, what else are you into?
704242 [deadpan] Minerals. Plate tectonics. Oh, and stand-up comedy, of course.
70427c I like... kites.
704000 [beat]
704242 [deadpan] Kites are cool.
70427c [sighs]
70427c The trick with an S.L.K. is not to make the spars too heavy. But if they're too light, you've got no ballast and then good luck tacking against the A.O.I.! [beat] I really like kites.
704242 [deadpan] They're starting to grow on me.
704007 Pizza delivery! Oh! Maud and Starlight? You're here too? Whoa-ho-ho! What a coincidence! 'Cause I was just, y'know, delivering this pizza to, um... you!
704000 [thwack]
704007 So how's it going?
70427c Uh, just hanging out—
704007 Hey! You could use this time to bond and talk about feelings! For example, do you feel like you're becoming friends?
70427c Um... I feel... like I don't want to talk about feelings?
704007 Great! I'll go next. I feel like I love that you two are becoming best friends! I mean, your friendship could be the friendship that makes Maud move to Ponyville! No pressure, Starlight. Um, hello? Where'd you two go?
704242 [deadpan] Sorry about my sister. There's no half-excited with her.
70427c Oh, I know. But she always calms down. Eventually.
70427c Why do you find rocks so fascinating?
704242 [deadpan] Each one has a different story to tell. Like Boulder here. This tells me he's over two thousand years old. [to Boulder] You don't look a day over six hundred.
70427c Wow. You can tell that from a line?
704242 [deadpan] I didn't get a rocktorate because I can shred on guitar like nopony else.
70427c [laughs]
704242 [deadpan] Another reason I like rocks – they don't exclude you if you're... different than other ponies.
70427c They're beautiful and strong, but they don't judge you or make you feel less than in any way. I think I'm starting to like rocks, too.
704000 [tapping]
70427c It's hollow?
704242 [deadpan] It's granite. Hollow granite is highly unusual.
704000 [crashing and crumbling]
704000 [whimsical music]
70427c Wow! Have you ever seen anything like this?
704242 [deadpan] No. And that's unusual. For me.
704007 There you are! I thought you went your separate ways but you can't imagine how happy I am to find you both together and to witness one of your firsts as friends!
704000 [camera flashes]
704007 First time discovering an underground cavern! [squeals] I can't wait 'til you're old and eating pistachios together and telling your grand-foals about this! Oh, no! They're not bonding!
704000 [ding]
704007 I got an idea!
704000 [ripping]
704007 [exaggerated] Whooaa! I'm tripping on a rock at this very moment! And now I'm falling down!
704000 [click, boom]
704007 [exaggerated] Oh, no! My accidental clumsiness has trapped us here! Where you'll be forced to bond until we're rescued.
70427c Oh, we won't have to wait for that. There's gotta be a spell that—
704242 [deadpan, to Boulder] Get us out of here, boy.
704000 [crashing and crumbling]
70427c Boulder, that was awesome!
704242 [deadpan] No. That was sandstone.
70427c More sand than stone, apparently.
704007 I'm thinking you wear these around your neck at all times so I don't lose you again, you sillies! That way, I can track your progress as friends!
704000 [cowbells donging]
704007 Ooh! And tomorrow, we can have a friendship brunch! What's your favorite kind of omelette cupcake?! [hushed] Mine's jalapeño red velvet!
704242 [deadpan groan]
70427c Yeah, um, I-I don't know if I can make it.
704007 You'll change your minds when you smell the yummy food! Come on!
704000 [cowbells donging]
704000 [snap]
70427c Oops.
704007 Tomorrow's brunch is going to be the scrumptiest, brunchiest, munchiest brunch ever!
704242 [deadpan] Yeah. About that...
704007 The problem is, while you two were alone, I couldn't get data points on your friendship probabilities! Were you making Starlight smile? How was Starlight's smile-to-frown ratio? Anything over five-to-one is great! Oh, and how many times did you smile like this? [squees]
704242 [deadpan] Zero times.
704007 Oh, Maud, don't be so hard on yourself! You've got the best friendship-maker in Ponyville on the case! I'll be by your side the whole time! Speaking of which, your bell fell off, silly!
704000 [cowbell donging]
704242 [deadpan] Pinkie Pie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but—
704007 Buuuuuut?
704242 [deadpan] [sighs] Never mind.
704007 Don't worry, Maud. When you see this brunch, you'll realize everything's gonna be okay! And then, I have amazing bonding activities planned for the next seventeen days! You and Starlight will be besties in no time! Goodnight! [kisses] [clap, clap] [snoring] ...Cupcake omelette...
704000 [birds tweeting]
704007 Friendship brunch!
704000 [paper rustling]
704242 [deadpan] [voiceover] Pinkie Pie. Thank you for trying so hard to help me make friends. But my decision has to be rock based. And Ghastly Gorge has such great rocks, I won't even have time for friends. It's better this way. Sorry it didn't work out. Maud.
704007 Maud! Wait!
704000 [train chuffing]
704007 Maud! [tearing up] Maud...
70427c [snoring softly]
704007 Starlight, wake up!
70427c [yelps] Kites!
704000 [thud]
70427c Huh? Oh. If this is about brunch, I-I, uh... You know what? Jalapeño red velvet omelettes sound gross. I-I just can't.
704007 Maud left in the middle of the night!
70427c Oh. I guess Ghastly Gorge really does have the best rocks.
704007 [sniffs] Why couldn't you two just be friends?
70427c Pinkie Pie, I like Maud.
704007 You do?
70427c Yeah. She's weird!
704007 Hey!
70427c No, in a good way! She sees the world in a totally different way than anypony I've ever met. She accepts me for who I am. She taught me that a rock is never just a rock, and she could make anything funny. We never had to say it, but we got each other.
704007 You really were becoming friends?
70427c I think so, but you kinda sorta... got in the way.
704007 [deep gasp]
70427c [gasps] You're right, too harsh. Let's go with... You ruined everything all the time?
704007 [whimper]
70427c Mmmmh, that's worse. What I'm trying to say is—
704007 [tearing up] I have to go!

704242 [deadpan] You didn't need to come. I'm having a great time on my own.
704000 [snap]
704242 [deadpan] I even made a new friend.
704007 Is it a rock?
704242 [deadpan] Yes.
704000 [snap]
704007 [shrieks] Maud!
704242 [deadpan] I don't belong in Ponyville. It only proved I'm better off all by myself. Like I always have been.
704007 Don't say that! It was all my fault! I— [shrieks] I thought I knew everything about making friends, but I didn't even know my own sister! I forced you to do things my way, but my way isn't your way!
704242 [deadpan] This way.
704007 Exactly!
704242 [deadpan] No. This way.
704007 Maud, I thought you couldn't make a friend without my help, but it turns out you couldn't make a friend with my help. I underestimated you, and I'm sorry.
704242 [deadpan] I know you did it out of love. You're my best sister friend forever.
704007 [bawling] Oh, Maud! I love you bigger than all Equestria! [sobbing]
704242 [deadpan] And you melt my heart more easily than sodium-rich plagioclase feldspar.
704007 [sniffs] I don't know what that means, but please please please please please give Ponyville another chance! But more importantly, give me another chance... to leave you alone.
704242 [deadpan] What do you think, Boulder?
70427c You're back!
704242 [deadpan] Mm-hmm.
70427c For good?
704242 [deadpan] Mm-hmm. This doesn't mean we need to start talking about feelings, does it?
70427c Heh. No way.
704242 [deadpan] Maybe after this we could decorate my new place.
70427c Totally! Where is it?
704242 [deadpan] Well, it's not in Ponyville. More like Ponyville-adjacent.
70427c It's perfect.
704007 Yes! My sister's totally staying in Ponyville! I mean Ponyville-adjacent! [laughs]
704000 [beat]
704007 Sorry, sorry, I'm leaving! I promise. I'm not even here. Aah, you're wearing the slippers! Okay, now I'm really leaving. Buh-bye!

70500e [gasps] Are you okay, Angel?
705040 [rattle, whimper, crying]
70500e I told you that entering the Ponyville Paw-kour Contest was a dangerous idea. You just rest here, and I'll have you all fixed up in no time. Oh, dear. I'm all out of bunny foot braces. I think we need to pay a visit to Dr Fauna.
705040 [whimpering]
70500e [straining] Oh, I was sure she would be here today.
705040 [whimpering]
70500e Hello? [knocks on door] Is anypony there?
70512b [muffled] Fluttershy? Oh, am I glad to see you!
70500e [straining] I wish I could say the same, but the door's stuck, so I, um... can't see you.
705000 [animals chattering]
70512b Ohhhh. Somebunny hurt his foot. Let's bandage that up so he can get back home. I'd like to keep him overnight, but as you can see, my place is just bursting with animals! [exhale] I don't think I can take in even one more critter right now!
7053aa [sneezes]
7053ab Oh, dear.
705000 [theme song]
705000 [animals chattering]
70500e [gasps] You really have your hooves full here.
70512b [sighs] This place is like a zoo! Then again, it's normally like that, but still... I can't keep up!
705000 [birds chirping]
70512b Oh. Now, does my favowite wittle bunny want a carrot pop?
705040 [blows raspberry]
70512b [sighs] That's okay. I think the goats ate all of them anyway.
705000 [goat belches]
70500e I just can't believe all these poor little animals are hurt. What happened?
70512b I'm flummoxed! Every day, there's more and more animals on my doorstep. Most of them just have minor ailments – hurt wings, stuffy noses, and such. But the trouble is even after they're all healed up, I can't seem to get these comfy critters to leave!
70500e Oh, dear.
705000 [nail clippers clipping]
70500e They do seem to have made themselves right at home here.
70512b I wonder why they chose to flock to my office. It just doesn't make sense.
70500e Don't be silly, Dr Fauna. You're the best vet pony in Equestria. At least that's what I've been telling everypony.
70512b Uh... you did what?
70500e Oh, no. Do you suppose it's my fault? I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. I just know animals feel safe and happy under your care.
705000 [ducklings chirping]
70512b Normally, I don't mind if a snake wants to slither in or a raccoon needs a rest, but now this place is so full, I have no space to treat any injured animals.
70500e That is a big problem... that I'm going to fix for you! I already have the perfect solution that'll make the critters happy and give you more space. Then you'll have all your ducks in a row!
70512b The sooner you fix it, the better!
70500e I'm on it!
70512b [sighs]
70500e I want to thank you all for rushing right over when I called.
705000 [squirrel chittering]
705040 [angry chittering]
70500e Dr Fauna needs my help with a serious problem.
705003 A friendship problem?
70500e No. Her vet clinic is a bit... maybe, um... overrun with adorable critters in dire need of a safe place to lay their heads, and... they don't have anywhere to go!
70500d Oh, that's just awful.
70500e I know!
705008 Yeah. Dr Fauna's always fixin' Winona up when she ain't feelin' too fine, so helpin' her out is A-okay by me.
70500c Hah! Yeah!
70500d You can count on us!
705007 [simultaneously] Okie-dokie-lokie!
705003 [simultaneously] Okay!
70500e Oh, that's great news! Because it means you'll all be helping me with something special, too. Something that's been a dream of mine for a long time.
705007 Oh, goody! Is your dream to make a bouncy castle shaped like a gigantic bundt cake?
70500e Um, no. Not exactly.
705007 Huh. Just me then.
70500c So? What is it, Fluttershy? Spill!
70500e My dream is to build a real animal sanctuary.
705000 [bird chirps]
70500e A beautiful habitat where every animal – whether sick or scared or even just lonely, feathered or furry, scaly or slimy – every critter would be welcome. My sanctuary can be the one place in Equestria they call home 'til they feel ready to take on the world.
705000 [animals cheering]
7052f9 [blows nose]
705003 Wow, Fluttershy! I've never heard you speak with such conviction.
70500d Oh! That was exquisite!
70500c Pretty awesome.
70500e Oh, thank you, everypony. You all taught me so much about building my confidence over the years. It's because of your friendship that I finally feel able to make my dream project a reality. But I can't build the sanctuary alone. Will you join me?
705015 [eager agreement]
705008 I'm happy to offer my extra hooves to ya. Huh. But come to think of it, I actually know a filly who'd be more help than I would. She's a friend of mine from Winona's sheep-herdin' competitions – Wrangler! Heh. She's an expert in animal enclosures.
70500e How lovely!
705007 Ooh-ooh-ooh! I know somepony, too! Hard Hat is the best construction pony in Ponyville. He can build anything you could ever, ever, ever want!
70500d Hearing you all mention these experts, I am reminded that I too have the perfect pony to help capture the essence of your vision. To give it some style, some flair! [chuckles]
70500e Is it you, Rarity?
70500d [chuckles] No! No. Um, I was referring to the premiere interior designer of the Canterlot elite – Dandy Grandeur. He helped me when I was setting up my Canterlot boutique. I know that he'd be thrilled to work with you.
70500e Wow, everypony! Thank you! I can't wait to meet all of them and hear their ideas. We're right on track to building the most wonderful sanctuary in Equestria!
7053ac [hissing]
70500e Thank you, Rupert. Ahem. It's wonderful that you all could join me to discuss the Ponyville sanctuary project. My friends have so many nice things to say about each of your talents. This is a big project, so I'm happy to have such experienced ponies working on it with me.
7053ad Rarity has impeccable taste in design and friends, so I can't wait to work with you, you know?
70500e I-I think so.
7053ae Yee-haw! I'm just lookin' forward to helpin' ya out, ma'am! And the animals.
70500e Of course.
7053af So, uh, Pinkie Pie said you drew up some blueprints?
70500e Um, not exactly. It's more of a dream board.
7053af Hmmm, that sure doesn't look like an animal hospital.
70500e Well, that's because it's not. It's a sanctuary. A place that is safe but not restrictive. Cozy but natural. A place where the animals can come and go as they please.
705000 [mouse squeaking]
70500e So, can you build it?
7053b0 [chuckling nervously] Uhhh...
70500e I want the sanctuary to have an open floor plan. No walls. More like an enclosure that melts into the trees. With a gate in the back. That way, the animals can return to the forest right when they feel ready.
705007 Sneaky! I like it!
7053af You know, uh, I designed the Ponyville Hospital. I could do the exact same thing right here. I still have the blueprints. Though it'll take a while to clear all these trees.
70500e But I don't want to clear the trees. I want to use them.
7053af Are you sure? What you're talking about doesn't really seem like a cohesive structure. Or any structure I'm familiar with.
70500e Critters don't live the same way ponies do. I know this is unconventional, but that's because we're trying to do something that's never been done before. I really believe it'll work.
705000 [birds chirping]
7053af Hmm. All right then. I'll see what I can do.
705007 See, Fluttershy? Whatever you want.
70500e Good.
7053af [to Steam Roller and Jack Hammer] I know she thinks she knows what's best, but once she sees how much better it works with these plans, she'll thank us.
7053b1 Uh-huh, yup.
7053ad Which one do you like for the window treatments?
70500d Ooooh! Loving the print on those!
70500e Um, not to be rude, but there must be some mistake. We have no need for curtains at the sanctuary.
7053ad And whyever not?
70500e Everything is gonna look natural in the animal habitats, not like it was made for ponies.
7053ad All those shades of brown and green? But... they're so... drab, you know? [chuckles]
70500e Drab? You're calling the colors of beautiful trees drab?
7053ad Exactly! The natural look is not in right now. This is better. Trust me.
70500e I appreciate your input, but I just know the animals would be happiest with dirt brown pillows and leaf green accents.
7053ad I'll... look into it.
70500e Thank you.
70500d When a client has a vision... [chuckles]
7053ad ...Sometimes they need me to steer them away from it. Especially if it's dirt brown.
7053ae And right there, we got your standard sheep-travelin' cage. Fits two critters, dependin' on size.
70500e Hmm.
705008 Uh, what is it, sugarcube?
70500e I'm looking for something less like a cage and more like a nice hug. Maybe if we lose that part.
7053ae Uh... Well then, it wouldn't be a cage.
70500e Exactly! Ooh! This is the perfect base for a little nest. I'll take a bunch of these and anything else the animals can burrow into.
7053ae You sure you don't want somethin' more secure for the critters?
705008 She does have a point there. You wouldn't want a bunny wanderin' into the wrong cave, would ya?
70500e No! No cages. I want to give the animals the freedom to come and go. It's the only way they'll feel comfortable.
705008 Well, she's the boss.
705000 [construction noises]
70500e [gasps]
7053af Hey, whaddya think, Fluttershy? I told ya we'd be fast. Almost finished with the building already.
7053ad The color just pops, you know?
7053ae Quite roomy inside, really. And very safe.
7053ad Don't keep us waiting, Fluttershy. Do you love it, or do you love it?
70500e I... I... [angry] I don't love it! This is not going to work at all! A giraffe can't fit through this door! With these curtains blocking the light, how are the birds gonna sing in the sunshine? And this is the opposite of a nice hug! I know you all worked hard, but none of you did anything I asked for!
7053af [scoffs] That's not true. We used the trees just like you asked!
7053ad And that curtain fabric is organic! It's got natural fibers!
7053ae And I added pillows inside my cages. That should count as feelin' like a hug!
70500e I may not know much about construction or interior design or wrangling, but I am an expert at one thing - the care of animals! And what animals need is a sanctuary, not this!
7053ad Maybe your "vision" wasn't all that it was cracked up to be, you know?
70500e My vision isn't the problem here! I told you all exactly what I wanted, and none of you listened to me! So while I appreciate your efforts, I no longer require your services!
70512b Hello! Oh, the animals have been so excited for the sanctuary, they couldn't wait any longer! [laughs] Can we take a look inside?
70500e Oh, um, actually, it's, uh, not ready and... [gasps]
705000 [bonk]
705000 [raccoon family chittering]
705000 [rip]
705000 [woodpecker pecking]
705000 [goat bleating]
705000 [cage closes]
705000 [bear growls]
7053ab [shriek]
705000 [bump]
705000 [structure collapses]
70500e [gasps]
70512b Oh, I'm so sorry, Fluttershy.
70500e No. I'm the one who should be sorry. This didn't go at all like I had imagined.
705000 [sweet music playing]
70500e Sleep tight, little one. It's going to be okay. I promise.
705000 [mice squeaking]
70500e Now, now, every mouse has gotta wait their turn.
705000 [mice squeaking]
70500e [sighs] I'm so sorry. I thought I'd have a beautiful sanctuary for you all to stay in by now. But I put my trust in the wrong ponies.
70512b It's okay, Fluttershy. I know you did your best, but we can make this work here. It'll be a bit, uh... tight. Heh. But with your help, we'll have these patients back on their paws in no time, even without a sanctuary.
70500e No!
705000 [bear groans]
70500e I won't give up! These animals need me! And I'm gonna solve this once and for all! If this little lady can crawl all the way here from Western Equestria, I can find a way to build her a safe place to rest!
705000 [animals cheering]
70512b [laughing]
70500e Oh! [joins in laughter] Oops. Everyone back to sleep now.
70500e Thanks for coming, everypony. As you know, building the sanctuary didn't go quite as planned.
705007 I know, right? Who would've guessed that Hard Hat wouldn't build whatever you want?
70500d I never would've invited Dandy to help if I thought he'd act in such a manner.
705008 [sighs] And Wrangler sure made a fool outta me, too. I'm sorry, Fluttershy.
70500e It's okay. You were all just trying to help. But I know that letting all the experts go was the right call.
705003 So what are you gonna do now?
70500e Try again. I'm going to rebuild the sanctuary and do it my way this time.
705007 All right, Fluttershy!
705008 [simultaneously] You show 'em, filly!
70500d [simultaneously] That's the spirit!
70500c How about putting an awesome flying course for the birds right there?
705007 And a carrot cake stand here?
705003 Ooh, a library cave?
70500e Everypony, stop! I appreciate you sharing your thoughts, but I need everypony to respect mine. Other ponies may be experts in their fields, but animals are my field of expertise. And if I say this is what I want, then this is what needs to happen! Oh, um, for the animals of course.
705007 Wow! We should call you "Flutterbold" now!
7050d4 [laughing]
70500e To get things back on track, I called in a favor from an old friend. He'll be here any minute.
705003 I thought you said no more experts.
70500e This is one expert I know I can trust to put the animals first. Plus there's nopony better at building.
705000 [knock on door]
705000 [door opens]
705306 [laughs] I heard somepony needs construction help fer them critters!
705003 Big Daddy McColt! [to the others] We met each other back when the map called me and Fluttershy to the Smokey Mountains!
70500e And he certainly knows his stuff when it comes to buildings and caring for animals.
705306 Well, shucks. Let's not stand around talkin' about it. Let's build us a sanctuary!
705000 [everyone cheers]
705000 [building montage music from "The Hooffields and McColts" playing]
70500e Are you ready?
70512b Oh, I'm more excited than a beaver in a log pile!
70500e Okay, you can open your eyes! Welcome to Sweet Feather Sanctuary, a safe and cozy retreat for every creature!
70512b [gasps] Oh, Fluttershy! This is amazing!
70500e Now you should have plenty of room at the clinic. Because once you've treated them, they can recover here! With my help, of course. It's okay, Lola. We all move at our own pace. Sometimes, all we need to do is believe in our dreams. And when we finally reach our goal, we'll know that it was worth what it took to get there, because the view will be even better than you imagined!
705000 [credits]
7062c4 [panting] [muttering] Oh, I have to... Oh! I can't believe the winter-to-spring transition is almost here!
70600d [humming] Oh, I know. I love it so much, I gave it its own term – "Spring-sition"! [laughs]
7062c4 Ohhh. I like that. [sighs] I'm going to have to relabel all my binders. Right after we finish... everything! We still have so much to do! Oh, my bustles and bows! Rarity, did we—?
70600d Already hemmed, ruched, and cut, my dear.
7062c4 [sighs] Oh. Rarity, no reason to panic, but, um, we seem to be temporarily low! And when I say "temporarily low", I mean "completely out of"—!
70600d The baby blue sapphires? They arrived this morning.
7062c4 Oh. Heh. Wonderful. [sighs] Oh! What about the design for the—?!
70600d And done!
7062c4 Wow. You are good. And you've really outdone yourself this time! The Morning Sunshine Tulip Frock is gorgeous!
70600d Ooh, thank you. Look, I know you're worried about something slipping between the cracks. But with your managerial skills and my fabulous designs, we have everything covered.
7062c4 You're right. You're right. There are no cracks.
70600d Would you be a dear and fetch me some vermilion satin from the back? And I'll start on the Eternal Elegance Empire Silhouette evening gown.
7062c4 My most certain pleasure!
70600d Oh. I love this picture. When was the last time we had that kind of fun together? [gasps] Why, I can't remember! Has it been that long?! I guess I've been so busy running my shop! [gasps] Oh, no! Something, or should I say somepony, is slipping between the cracks! [sobs] I miss my Sweetie Belle! [sobs]
7062c4 Rarity, we're running low on vermilion satin.
70600d Huh? [bawls]
7062c4 I... I can order more!
706000 [theme song]
70600d [continues bawling] And this is when we pretended we were storybook princesses. And here we pretended we were on a dangerous yet stylish safari. [sobs] So many wonderful memories! [sobs, blows nose, resumes sobbing] Not to put too fine a point on it, but... [bawls harder] Sweetie Belle loves playing dress-up. I miss her so much!
7062c4 Then why don't you go visit her?
70600d [through tears] I wish I... could, but... between... running... three stores and the spring-sition... I couldn't possibly...
7062c4 But you've already done almost all the work. I can handle the rest.
70600d B-B-But... but...
7062c4 Rarity, go. I have everything well in hoof.
70600d [sobs, calmer] Mm, point taken. [excitedly] I am going to visit my sister!
7062c4 Way to immediately turn that around.
70600d We can spend the whole day together! And we can do all her favorite things!
7062c4 I'm sure she'd love that.
70600d Oh, Sassy, thank you!
7062c4 Of course! Now get out of here!
70600d I'm going! I'm going! Hang on, sis! I'm coming!
706080 [giggling]
7063b2 [screams]
706065 Excuse us!
70600a Comin' through!
706066 Cutie Mark Crusaders mid-mission here!
706080 [giggling, screaming]
706000 [crash!]
706065 That was fun! Let's do it again!
706066 Scoot, we've got a job to do.
706065 Later?
706066 All right, Chipcutter. We've done our part. The rest is up to you.
7063b3 You really think I have it in me to be a sculptor?
706065 Yup!
7063b3 But why?
706066 Because you said you weren't good at anything except getting in trouble for making sculptures out of your lunch, right?
7063b3 Yeah. I can't help it. When I look at my sandwich, it's like it's just asking me to... turn it into a dragon.
70600a Well, what is this slab asking you to turn it into?
7063b3 Hmmm... I see...
706000 [jackhammering noises]
706000 [crumble]
70600a Wow! T-That's incredible! It looks just like us!
706065 We knew you had it in you, Chip!
7063b3 This is way better than sandwich sculpting!
706066 Chip, we're proud of you.
706000 [flash]
7063b3 I finally got my cutie mark!
70600a Woo-hoo! All right!
706065 Yes!
706066 Way to go!
706000 [hoof-bump]
706065 [sighs] Not a bad way to start a day.
70600a Not a bad way at all! Helpin' ponies is just about my favorite thing to do.
706066 Another satisfied client!
70607f Mm-hmm!
70600a So who's up next?
706066 Pretty sure it's Zipporwhill. She needs help reconnecting with her cutie mark – three puppy paw prints.
706065 When is she swinging by?
706066 Well, I think she should be arriving right about...
706000 [door opens]
706066 ...now.
70600a Wow. You are good.
706066 Come on in, Zipporwhill.
706065 Okay, so what seems to be the problem, exactly?
70622f It's my puppy, Ripley. We used to be so close. In fact, I got my cutie mark the day I found him and took him home. But now, it's like he wants nothing to do with me.
706065 Don't you worry. You've come to the right place! The Cutie Mark Crusaders are on the job!
70600a Trust us. Before you know it, you and your puppy will be back to bein' besties!
706066 You have the CMC guarantee! No matter what it takes, we promise you'll have our full attention.
70600d [singsongy] Guess who's here to spend the whole day with her little sister?!
706066 [gasps] Rarity? [grunts]
70600d Mmmm!
706066 [laughs nervously]
70600d [to Zipporwhill] Oh! Heh-heh. So sorry, dear. You're tiny. I didn't even see you there! Tend to get carried away with my entrances! Ta-da! [laughs]
706066 Rarity, what are you doing here?
70600d I am here to spend the day with you! I'm so excited, I could practically faint! You don't happen to have a fainting couch in here, do you?
706066 No!
70600d Oh, pfft, of course not. It's a treehouse! That would be très gauche!
706066 Right... Well, I sure am happy to see you, and spending the day with you does sound like a lot of fun, but... I'm kind of right in the middle of something important. I have responsibilities and...
70600d Oh.
70600a Go on, Sweetie Belle. We've got this covered. How often do you get to spend time with your sister?
706065 Yeah! Go have fun.
706066 You sure you two can handle our client here?
70600d "Client"? Oh, that is so adorable!
706066 Uh, thanks? I think?
70600d [sniffs] Ooh! You have mints to offer your "clients". [giggles] How.. professional. [giggles]
706066 Are you sure you two got this?
70600a We have it handled.
70600d Oh, my! Look at this wall of satisfied customers! [gasps] You girls really have come a long way.
706066 Well, all right then. [to the other Crusaders] But, lemme know if you need me or run into any trouble.
70600d Come on, come on! You'll never guess what I have planned! [squeals]
706000 [foals and Rarity giggling]
70600d Ooh! So fun!
706066 [indignantly] What?
70600d [giggles] It's just I know how much you love these puppet shows.
706066 I did.
70600d Oh, it's just like old times! You, me, greasy popcorn. It's like no time has passed at all.
70622f [struggling] Come on... [grunts]
70600d Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! It's your favorite part!
706000 [music and silly sound effects]
706000 [foals and Rarity giggling]
70600d Banana peels are so very, very slippery! [laughs] It's funny because it's true! [laughs]
706066 [laughs nervously, sighs]
70600d What's the matter, darling?
706066 I, um, guess I just prefer black box experimental theater.
70600d What?! Since when?
706066 [sighs] I dunno. It's no big deal. This is great.
706000 [bell dings]
70600d Okay. We're here! Ta-da! [laughs, clears throat] Aren't you excited to be back here again? Do I know my baby sister, or do I know my baby sister?
706066 Uh... Yeah... Where is "here" exactly?
70600d Oh, pfft! Stop being so silly! You know this is your favorite ice cream shop!
706066 Oh. Right. From when I was a little filly.
70600d And I convinced the original owner to come out of retirement to make you your all-time favorite dessert! [giggles, claps twice]
706000 [tray drops]
706066 Huh. I remember it being much bigger.
70600d Well, go ahead. I know you're dying to dig in.
706066 [slurps, gulps]
70600d Well?
706066 [laughs nervously, sighs] That was, uh... one tasty bite. Still a little hungry, though.
70600d [gasps] We can get another sundae! Chocolate with rainbow sprinkles, perhaps?
706066 I was thinking something more like a salad.
70600d A salad? When did you get so practical?
706066 Oh, um... I guess another scoop would be fine!
70600d [gasps] One more Filly Clown Surprise, please!
706000 [thump]
706066 [groans]
7063b4 [panting]
70622f Hey, Ripley!
706065 Look at me! Over here!
706000 [squeaking]
7063b4 [yawns]
706000 [balloon squeaking]
70600d I know you must be bored, darling. This is a very long line for one of Twisty Pop's balloons.
706066 [groans]
70600d But just be patient. We'll get you your favorite balloon bouquet, and it'll all be worth it.
70622f [baby noises] Who's a good puppy? Who's a good puppy?! You're the good puppy!
7063b4 [whines]
70622f Now come on, puppy-wuppy! Get the bally-wally!
706065 Come on, Ripley! Like this!
70600a Good Scootaloo! See?
7063b4 [barking]
70622f [sighs] It's not working.
706065 Maybe if the ball tasted better?
70600a I don't think that that's it, Scoot.
706066 Doesn't look like it's going so well. I'm just gonna do a quick check with the CMCs.
70600d Well, I guess duty calls, and-and you, you have that now...
706066 What?
70600d Oh nothing, nothing. Go on.
706065 Hey, Sweetie Belle. How's your day with Rarity going?
706066 Well, it's not exactly great...
70600a What do you mean?
706066 I don't know. It's like Rarity doesn't even know me anymore.
706065 I wish we could say our day is going better.
7063b4 [barking]
70600a But we can't.
706065 Seems like Zipporwhill's puppy doesn't want anything to do with her.
706066 Hmmm. I see what you mean... [gasps] You know, it's an awfully big puppy...
70600d Sweetie Belle, hurry! He's making it!
706066 Gotta go...
706000 [balloons squeaking]
70600d [gasps] I know just what to do with this!
706000 [fashion music]
70600d And pose!
706000 [camera clicks]
70600d And pose!
706000 [camera clicks]
70600d Love the camera!
706000 [camera clicks]
70600d Hate the camera.
706000 [camera clicks]
70600d Love it again!
706000 [camera clicks]
70600d Sweetie Belle, you did "hate the camera" for all these shots! [sighs] Let's do it again.
706066 No!
70600d [gasps]
70600a Come on, Zipporwhill, you can do this!
706000 [squeaking]
7063b4 [sniffing]
70600d W-What do you mean, no?
706066 Rarity, this is hard for me to say, but... um...
70600d Sweetie Belle, what is it? You've been acting weird all day. You used to love doing these things with me.
706066 That's just it! I used to! That's not who I am anymore!
70622f This isn't who I am! My cutie mark must be for something else, because my puppy just doesn't love me anymore! Hmph!
70600d But it is you! You love puppet shows and dressing up and taking silly photos and tiny little clown-shaped ice creams!
706066 Really?! If you still think I like doing this stuff, then maybe you don't know me at all!
70600d [whimpering]
70600d [sobbing] I can't believe Sweetie Belle talked to me like that. [indignant] And after everything I did to set up a whole day of doing her favorite things! I mean, accusing me of not knowing her?! I know her better than anypony! Um, thank you, Twisty, but the hard truth is, my sister is being unappreciative right now! And I'm going to go and give her a piece of my mind!
706000 [balloon deflating]
706066 Hey, Zipporwhill. What are you doing here? Where are Apple Bloom and Scootaloo?
70622f They're with my puppy. He seems to like them better than me anyway.
706066 Now, I'm sure that's not true.
70622f It is. He doesn't like doing anything with me anymore. [sighs] He didn't even want to play with this. And all puppies love these. [sniffs]
706000 [squeak]
70622f [sniffing, crying]
706066 I think that might be your problem right there! Come on!
706000 [squeak]
7063b4 [yawns]
706065 [groans] Find Zipporwhill, Ripley!
70600a Woof, woof! It's Zipporwhill! Woof?
706065 [sighs] It's hopeless.
70600a Sweetie Belle!
706065 Zipporwhill! [sighs] We're sorry we haven't figured this out yet.
706066 Don't worry, girls. I think I cracked this one.
70600d Aha! There she is! [gasps] Oh, dear. Really should have changed. [huffs] No matter! I'm going to give her quite the talking to! ...Right after she's done with her conversation. Anger is no excuse for poor manners, after all.
706066 Okay, Zipporwhill. What do you see?
70622f My puppy?
706066 That's not what I see. I see a full-grown dog.
70622f He did get bigger, I guess.
706066 He's not just bigger. He's older, too.
7063b4 [grunts]
706066 You don't still play with the same toys from when you were a foal, do you?
70622f Oh. Ohhh. The squeaker is a little small for him now. [sighs] It's just hard for me to believe he's not the same adorable little guy I found anymore.
706066 I understand. But doing things like you used to won't turn him back into a puppy.
70622f So... what do I do?
706066 Treat him like the dog he is, and find new favorite things to do together.
70622f You think so?
70600d I know so!
706066 Rarity?!
70600d Oh, Sweetie Belle. I heard what you said, and you are so right.
706065 About the dog?
70600d Yes, but about us, too. The truth is, I know you're not a little filly anymore. But it's just... the last time we did all of those things together, I... I didn't realize it was gonna be the last last time. I loved doing those things with you. It's hard for me to let that go.
706066 Aww, Rarity! I love being with you too! That will never change! But... maybe we could just try to do different things together?
706000 [clicking]
7063b4 [alerted dog noise] [panting]
70622f What is it, puppy? [giggles] I mean, Ripley?
7063b4 [panting]
70622f [giggling] I love you too, Ripley! Thank you, Crusaders.
706080 No problem!
7063b5 [laughing]
70622f Oh, Ripley!
70600d Sweetie Belle, I'm so very proud of the pony you've grown into.
706066 And I'm proud that no matter what, I'll always be your little sister.
70600d I, uh, have a little bit of time before I have to head back to Canterlot. Could we spend it together? What would a grown pony like you want to do?
706066 Well, I do have one idea...
706103 [licking lips]
70600d Heh, I didn't realize your idea would be such a delicious one! [giggles] I don't know how I'm going to finish this.
706066 Oh! I'll help you!
70600d [giggles]
706066 [giggles]
706000 [camera clicks]
706000 [credits]
707080 [straining]
70700a [straining] Scootaloo... is this such a... good idea?
707065 What are you talking about? This is the best idea I've ever had!
70700a [grunting] It's just...
707065 You wanna come. But we talked about this. Non-Pegasus ponies fall through the clouds.
70700a Right, but...
707066 I think we're good.
707000 [rubber band straining]
70700a We are? Scootaloo, I know you have to go to Cloudsdale to finish your report. I'm just wonderin' if this is the best way to get there.
707065 It'll be fine. Besides, how else could I get there?
70700a A Pegasus chariot?
707066 A flock of birds?
70700a A hot-air balloon?
707065 Huh. Those do seem a lot safer. Maybe I should try to find another waaaaaaaaayyyyyy!
707081 [gasps]
707065 Woo-hoo!
707000 [poof]
707065 [grunts, weakly] Nailed it.
707000 [lawnmower humming]
7073b6 [echoing] Uh, little ma'am, are you all right?
707000 [head rattling]
707065 [gasps] You're... You're... You're... Rainbow Dash's dad!
7073b6 Uh, yes. Bow Hothoof at your service.
707065 [screams loud and long, fades out]
707000 [theme song]
707065 [continues screaming]
7073b6 Uh, honey? Somethin's goin' on out here!
707000 [door opens]
707065 [stops screaming, resumes screaming at a higher pitch]
7073b7 Oh! Heavens to Celestia, what's wrong with her?!
7073b6 I don't know, but you just made it worse.
707065 Sorry! It's just you're... Rainbow Dash's parents! [resumes screaming]
7073b6 She's doing it again!
7073b7 Oh, dearie, please! You might shatter my Princess Celestia commemorative plates! Ow!
707000 [plates cracking]
707065 [stops screaming] I'm so sorry. I just... [squeals] I can't believe I'm meeting you! My name's Scootaloo, and I'm doing a school report on your daughter! [ding]
7073b6 Our Rainbow Dash?
707065 The report's on an inspirational pony in my life, and nopony inspires me more than she does! I'm putting together this scrapbook for my report! I'm her biggest fan!
7073b6 Now, little trotter, what you say is impossible. [excitedly] Because nopony is a bigger fan of our Rainbow Dash than us!
707065 Whoa! You always wear that shirt?
7073b6 Heh. Actually, it's, uh, laundry day. But pretty great, right?!
707065 Yeah!
7073b7 My name's Windy Whistles, and I just have to say that it is a total blast to meet somepony that loves Rainbow Dash as much as we do!
7073b6 What can we help you with?
707065 Well, I know all about Rainbow Dash's time in Ponyville, but I don't know anything about her life before that.
7073b6 Well, you came to the right place!
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 [gasps]
7073b7 Here you go! Rainbow Dash's favorite meal! A pasta and potato sandwich on sourdough! She just loved to carbo-load. [giggles]
707065 I can't believe I'm eating Rainbow Dash's favorite food made by Rainbow Dash's mom while sitting in Rainbow Dash's childhood kitchen! This is the greatest day of my life! [munches loudly] Mmmm!
7073b6 I think it's time for a tour of the house.
707065 [mouth full] Okay.
7073b6 Our little Dashie was an early learner and so rambunctious. The combination was—
7073b7 [singsongy] Exciting!
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 Whoa... Is that... her room?
707000 [door opens]
707065 [screams] Rainbow Dash's linen closet! Her carpet! Her inspirational poster! [reading] "When the going gets tough, the tough don't notice because they have hard shells." That's so Rainbow Dash!
707000 [camera flashing]
707065 Woo-hoo!
7073b6 Scootaloo, wanna see something really cool?
707000 [curtain opens]
707000 [door opens]
707000 [heavenly choir singing]
707065 [gasps]
707000 [door closes]
7073b6 I, uh, installed the sound effects myself. [chuckles]
707000 [door opening and closing, heavenly choir turning on and off]
7073b6 Pretty great, huh?
707065 So great!
7073b7 And look at this! She was wearing it when she spoke her first words.
707065 So cool!
707000 [camera flashes]
7073b7 And this broken lantern is from when she first learned to fly.
707000 [camera flashes]
7073b7 And this bitten apple is from when she grew her first tooth! [gasps] So many memories!
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 You're so lucky to have all of these!
7073b7 Well, I may have a ton of Dash-mentos, but I don't have any of those "Rainbow Dash Saves Ponyville" headlines like you.
707065 [gasps] Trade-sies?
7073b7 Deal-sies!
707065 So where's all the Wonderbolt stuff?
7073b6 You mean Rainbow Dash's personal collection of Wonderbolt memorabilia?
707065 No. I mean, where's all the stuff about Rainbow Dash getting accepted into the Wonderbolt Academy and then getting chosen as a Wonderbolt? Wait, you don't know that your daughter's a Wonderbolt? And I got to tell you?!
7073b8 Uhhhhhhhhh...
707065 Oh, wow! You should see your faces right now!
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 See? That's what your faces look like.
7073b8 Our daughter's a Wonderbolt?!
707000 [heavenly choir singing]
707000 [door closes]
7073b6 Great timing.
707065 Great door.
7073b7 I just... It's... Unbelievable!
707065 You two were kind enough to show me the Rainbow Dash you know. Now please, allow me to show you the Rainbow Dash I know.
707000 [Wonderbolts' theme playing]
70707c Let's make some thunder!
70700c I was born to make thunder!
707000 [thunder strikes]
7073b6 Our baby's a Wonderbolt!
7073b7 [cheering loudly]
70707c We've got turbulence!
70700c How? Where's it coming from?
7073b6 I'm so proud!
70707a There!
7073b8 [cheering loudly] She's a Wonderbolt!
70700c Oh, no.
70707c Okay. Which pony broke protocol and invited guests to our training exercises?!
70700c I guess they're with me. [groans, embarrassed] Mom, Dad. So... good... to see you.
7073b7 Oh, honey, it's so great to see you, too! And wow! You were so amazing up there with all of that flying!
70700c Uh, how did you know I was here?
7073b7 Scootaloo filled us in on everything, you modest pony you!
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 I can't believe I'm documenting the moment your parents first saw you as a Wonderbolt!
7073b7 And these must be your Wonderbolt friends! Hello, team! I'm Windy Whistles, the mom of the best Wonderbolt ever! Yeah! Just kidding. You guys were great, too! Go, team!
70700c Moooom!
707065 [chuckles]
70707c Hello, ma'am. Nice to meet you.
7073b7 Nice to meet you as well, and love those goggles! Love 'em! You know, I have goggles, too. But they're mostly just for swimming. Oh, and bath time.
70700c Mom, please! They don't wanna hear about your bath time!
7073b6 I can't believe it! My daughter, a Wonderbolt! [sobs] So proud!
70700c Dad, hold it together. We're in public.
7073b6 I know! I know, i— but it's... just... You had a goal, and... you achieved it! [sobs]
707000 [camera flashes]
70707c All right, Wonderbolts! Let's hit the showers and give Rainbow Dash some time to spend with her family.
70700c Okay, yeah! Uh, great practice! I'll, uh, eh, catch up with you guys in a minute!
707219 Sir, you really raised a great flyer!
7073b6 Oh, no! [straining] Tears... welling up again!
70700c Dad!
7073b6 [continues sobbing]
707000 [camera flashes]
70700c Could you give us a sec?
707065 Is something wrong?
70700c Yeah. You should've warned me that you were bringing my parents! Or talked to Twilight or something! Not just shown up!
707065 Why?
70700c Ugh! It's just my parents and I have a delicate relationship. I love them very much, and we're really close, but there's a reason I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt! They can be a little bit... embarrassing.
707065 Huh? Really?
70700c Yeah, really! And now you've invited a whole lot of crazy into my life!
707065 What's wrong with a little support?
707065 Bow and Windy, I'd like you to meet Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle.
70700a Hi!
707066 Hello.
7073b6 Greetings, small ponies.
70700a Are you excited to see Rainbow Dash?
7073b7 Oh, my, yes! And to think we never bothered to come to a Wonderbolt event!
7073b6 We said if Rainbow Dash isn't a Wonderbolt, then what's the point? But now, she is!
707065 And she earned it! Did you know it all started when she won a spot in the coveted Wonderbolts Academy, training under Spitfire?
7073b7 I didn't know that! How wonderful!
707065 But then, she had some heavy competition. Especially against another Pegasus named Lightning Dust.
7073b7 Oh, no!
707065 But, of course, Rainbow Dash proved to be the best and later made it into the Wonderbolt Reserves!
7073b7 Hooray again!
707065 But jealous ex-Wonderbolt Wind Rider was worried that Rainbow Dash might break his speed record. And so, he framed her for a crime she didn't commit.
7073b7 Oh, no!
707065 But thanks to Rarity, Rainbow Dash proved her innocence and became a backup Wonderbolt until Fire Streak retired, and she became an official Wonderbolt!
7073b7 Hooray! Wow, what a gripping tale!
7073b6 You really know your Rainbow Dash history. You're going to do great on your report.
70700a Show's about to start.
707000 [Wonderbolts' theme playing]
7073b8 [hooting]
7073b6 Come on, Bolts! Let's start this thing!
7073b7 Wonderbolts' Big Showcase! Here! We! Gooooooooo!
7073b6 Rip it up and tear! It! Down!
7073b7 Then build it back up again and tear it back down again! Yeah!
7073b6 Woo! Yeah! Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go go go! Yes! Go, Rainbow Dash! Best Wonderbolt ever!
7073b7 Woo-hoo! That's my daughter! Go, Rainbow! Go, Dashie, go-go-go-go-go!
7073b8 [cheering loudly]
7073b7 You go, girl!
707219 [to Rainbow] Your folks were definitely loud, but they weren't that bad.
707000 [fireworks]
70707c Whoa! Since when did we add fireworks to the show?!
70700c Uhhhh, we didn't.
7073b6 Bow Hothoof:
7073b6 Attagirl!
7073b6 Yeah!
7073b6 Go-go-go-go-go!
7073b7 Windy Whistles:
7073b7 Woo-hoo!
7073b7 Go, girl! Go, girl, you got it!
7073b7 You're a Wonderbolt!
707219 Wow...
707000 [crowd chattering]
7073b6 Go, Rainbow Dash! You sign that photo! Whoo!
7073b8 Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon! Cut the ribbon!
707000 [camera flashes]
7073b8 The camera loves you! Yeah!
7073b6 Now, let's do the pyramid! Scootaloo, get up there! You're the top!
70707c [to Rainbow] You really do got yourself your very own mega-fans. Lucky you.
70700c [groans]
70700c [groans]
707000 [locker door opens]
7073b7 You hung that towel!
707000 [clang!]
7073b7 Yeah!
7073b6 Greatest towel hanger of all time! [chanting] Towel!
7073b8 [chanting] Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Towel! Tow—
70700c Stop! This is ridiculous! Mom and Dad, you are both too supportive! This is exactly why I didn't tell you I was a Wonderbolt! You're just... too much!
7073b7 Did... Did we do something wrong?
70700c Yes! The fireworks, the cheerleading, and-and how do you even compare who is better or worse at hanging up a towel?!
7073b6 We're just trying to be supportive.
70700c Well, I'm tired of it! I've had enough of you two being so proud of every little ridiculous, insignificant thing I do! [pants] I think you should leave.
7073b7 First of all, great job yelling at us, sweetie. No one [sniffs] can make their parents feel more worthless than you!
7073b6 [through tears] Your words were direct, clear, and... so painful! Is there nothing you can't do?!
707065 Why?
70700c Scootaloo, you don't understand!
707065 I met your parents hoping to learn more about you, but I don't like what I found out! I'll find somepony else to do my hero report on.
707000 [sad music]
707000 [scooter revving]
70700c [panting] Scootaloo, wait! I know I wasn't myself back there, and I shouldn't have snapped at my parents! That's exactly why I didn't tell them I'm a Wonderbolt!
707065 I don't understand. They're so proud of you.
70700c [sighs] Can I tell you something?
707065 Sure.
70700c Okay, but you might wanna hold onto your wings because this could rock you to your very core. Believe it or not, there was a time when I wasn't the best at everything.
707065 [gasps]
70700c See this picture? It looks like I won something awesome, but actually...
707124 And last, but not least, it's time to hand out our participant stickers!
7073b8 Yeeeeeeeaaaaahhhhh!
7073b6 Bow Hothoof:
7073b6 Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
7073b6 Yeah, Rainbow Dash!
7073b6 You show 'em!
7073b7 Windy Whistles:
7073b7 Go, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!
7073b7 Hooray!
7073b7 Yeah!
7073b6 Greatest participant ever!
7070b5 Uh, your parents realize you didn't win, don't they?
707000 [camera flashes]
70700c Granted, I was the youngest pony in the senior competitive circuit. Most other ponies my age were still in the Junior Flappers' Club. I thought it was utterly mortifying having my parents cheer me on even when I lost!
70700c [voiceover] But then, when I started to win competitions – which didn't take very long, by the way – things got even worse!
7073b6 Bow Hothoof:
7073b6 Yeah!
7073b6 Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
7073b6 Yeah, Rainbow Dash, you show 'em!
7073b7 Windy Whistles:
7073b7 Whoo!
7073b7 Go, Rainbow! Go, Rainbow!
7073b7 Woo-hoo-hooo! Yeah!
70700c [voiceover] Being the best came with consequences. Very loud, very embarrassing consequences.
70700c [sighs]
707065 Ya know, some ponies would dream of having parents like that.
70700c Yeah, right! Name one!
707065 [sighs] Me. Growing up, I never thought I'd be the best at anything, because nopony ever told me. But your parents told you over and over again. Look! Best bath taker ever. Best carrot eater under three. Greatest napper of all time!
70700c [scoffs] I am pretty good at napping. I can fall asleep anywhere. [snores] Huh?
707065 For your entire life, your parents gave you the confidence to believe in yourself.
70700c You're right. I was always so embarrassed by my parents that I didn't realize their support actually made me the awesome, confident, amazing, awesome, and awesome pony I am! [sighs] And I took them for granted.
707065 And you yelled at them.
70700c [groans] I gotta make this right. I have an idea, but I'm gonna need your help. That is, if you're willing to help me after I acted like that.
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 Now, that's a great picture! "Rainbow Dash learns the error of her ways"!
7073b7 I'm telling you, I just can't see a thing. Scootaloo, you are just so great at blindfolds!
7073b6 It's true. You must tell me what kind of knot you used. Uh, falconer's knot? Wait, no! A farmer's loop!
7073b7 What's this all about, anywho?
707000 [microphone feedback]
70700c [over loudspeaker] Windy Whistles and Bow Hothoof, please be seated for a super private Wonderbolt event! [clears throat] Mom and Dad, welcome to the... [quickly] "I Love My Parents and I'm Sorry That I Took Them for Granted and I Know That They Made Me Who I Am Today So I Really Wanna Make It Up to Them"... [normally] event. Enjoy!
707000 [Wonderbolts' theme music]
70700c Thanks for doing this.
70707c Happy to help.
7073b8 Oooh... Ahhh... Oh! Ooh! [more awed excitement sounds]
70700c Mom and Dad, I want you to know that I'm your biggest fan.
7073b7 Oh, honey, thank you. But you didn't have to do all this. It's kind of [whispers] embarrassing.
7073b6 Eh, it is a bit much.
707000 [camera flashes]
707065 And that's why Rainbow Dash is the most inspirational pony in my life!
707000 [applause]
70705b Thank you, Scootaloo. Very well researched! But a little heavy on the pictures, and there was a moldy sandwich in your report. [chuckles] Um, I'll give you a B.
70700c Yeah! Greatest report giver of all time!
7073b9 [chanting] Scootaloo! Scootaloo! Scootaloo!
7073b9 Bow Hothoof, Windy Whistles, and Rainbow Dash:
7073b9 Scootaloo!
7073b9 Scootaloo!
7073b9 Scootaloo!
7073b9 Scootaloo!
7073b9 Scootaloo!
7073b9 Scootaloo!
70705b Cheerilee:
70705b Keep it down!
70705b Okay!
70705b This isn't a rock-and-roll concert!
70705b Please!

708066 Hey, Apple Bloom! Rarity's reorganizing her shop, and look what she found! Old costumes from the talent show!
708065 We thought they'd come in handy in case we ever help a pony put on a play or need to make a quick escape disguised as clowns.
70800a Here ya go, Big Mac.
708065 Whoa, that sure is a lot of apples!
70800a Are you makin' another delivery to Starlight's old village?
708026 Eeyup.
708066 That's an awful long way for a pony to go, isn't it?
708026 Eeyup.
70800a You've been goin' there a lot lately. What is this, your fifth trip this week?
708026 [laughs nervously] Eeyup.
70800a Okay, well, have fun. So what other costumes did you bring, Sweetie Belle?
708065 Are you crazy?! We can't talk about costumes at a time like this!
70800a Time like what?
708065 Your brother is hiding something. Did you see the way he was acting?
708066 Yeah. He totally blushed when you brought up how often he's been going to Starlight's old village.
708065 Something is definitely going on. There can be only be one reason a pony would travel so far, so often.
708065 Scootaloo:
708065 He's taking private skiing lessons!
708066 Sweetie Belle:
708066 He's training for a marathon!
70800a Apple Bloom:
70800a I've been cooking a lot of broccoli...
70800a ...and he wants to get away from the smell!
708080 [laughing]
708000 [theme song]
708065 Maybe he's a spy on a mission to thwart an evil villain with a secret weapon - an apple cannon!
70800a No, that's crazy! I think it's my broccoli thing.
708066 Why don't we just ask him?
708065 You saw how shifty he was acting earlier. There's no way he'll tell us what he's doing. Plus, I really wanna go undercover. We already have costumes! Call me "Agent Rainbowhead".
708066 I'll be "Shimmering Spectacles", a librarian with a mysterious past.
70800a And I'll be a pirate spy! Arrrgh! A spy-rate!
708000 [record scratching]
70800a [gasps] Avast! Our ship be leavin' port!
708065 Huh?
70800a Big Mac's leavin'! If we're gonna be spies, we gotta go! Now!
708026 [whistling]
70800a Big Mac's a-comin'! Quick! Act like apples!
708066 What? How?
708000 [romantic music]
708066 Who's that pony?
708065 Let me see! I dunno. Shouldn't have taken the binoculars. I don't know anypony here.
70800a That must be Sugar Belle. Applejack told me about her bakery. Obviously, she's just been orderin' a lot of apples.
708000 [door opens]
708066 So nothing fishy's going on.
708065 No way! We came here to be spies! And no spy I know has ever solved a case that quick!
708066 Mmm, how many spies do you know?
708065 That's... not important. What's important is that we do more recon. Follow my lead!
708081 Mm.
708000 [spy music]
70800a Whoa. She sure likes her apples.
708066 What is she doing? Making the biggest apple pie in Equestria?
70827f Thanks for coming all this way, Big Mac.
708026 Pfft! [whinnying laugh]
70827f It sure is nice seeing you again so soon.
708026 Eeyup. [giggles]
70827f All I used to bake were boring old muffins, but thanks to your apple deliveries, I get to bake all kinds of delicious treats! Apple pies, apple fritters, apple turnovers, caramel apples, caramel apple cakes... [sighs] I just wish I had more room to display it all. My shelves only hold so much.
70800a I'm tellin' you, this pony reeeeaaally likes her apples.
708066 [gasps] Or Big Mac!
70807f Huh?
708066 Just look!
70827f Ooh! Uh... [giggles]
708026 Oh, I... [giggles]
70800a Sweetie Belle, I-I think you're right! [loudly] I think my brother has a crush!
708066 Shh!
708000 [door opens]
70800a Psst! Big Mac! [to the Crusaders] Now remember, my brother's super shy, so he's probably gonna be embarrassed about his crush. Just try and make him feel comfortable. Hey, Big Mac, it's me! Apple Bloom!
708026 Eeyup.
708105 We're here, too!
708026 Mm-hmm.
70800a I'm gonna ask you a very personal question, and I want you to answer honestly. Do you... have a crush on... Sugar Belle?
708026 Eeyup.
708065 Well, that was easy.
70800a This is so excitin'! My big brother has his very first crush!
708065 First crush? What about Cheerilee?
708066 It doesn't really count when you trick a pony into drinking a love potion, does it?
708026 [angrily] Nnope!
70800a [singsongy] My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! My brother has a crush! [normally] Wait! Does Sugar Belle even know you like her?
708026 Uh-uh.
70800a Then you gotta tell her!
708026 O-Oh... eh... ehhhh...
708066 We're pretty sure she likes you! I mean, she keeps ordering apples just so she can see you again.
708026 Eeeyou think so?
708065 Totally! But you'll never know if you don't try.
708026 Okay!
708065 Go get her, Big Mac!
708026 [deep breath]
708000 [knocking]
708000 [romantic music]
7083ba [California accent] Hey, girl. Heh-heh. I was writin' poetry by the pond when I saw these flowers. I thought I'd show them how pretty you are.
70827f Oh! Heh. Thanks, Feather Bangs.
708026 [sad snort]
708065 Um, is it possible to have two crushes at once? Because it looks like Big Mac may not be the only pony Sugar Belle likes.
70800a Hey, Big Mac! Where ya goin'?
708026 Home!
708066 You can't let that Feather fella get in the way of your one true love!
708065 You've gotta take him down!
70800a What can he do that you can't?
708026 That!
7083ba Whoops! Heh-heh. These balls are like you. I'll always catch you if you fall.
7083bb [swoon]
708065 Seriously? That line worked?
708026 She'll never pick me.
70800a Sure she will, 'cause we're gonna help you.
708026 No love potions!
708080 [laugh]
70800a Don't worry, Big Mac. We learned our lesson the hard way.
708065 Yeah. We're never gonna do that again.
708066 Besides, I know exactly what to do! When I was younger, I read all the fairy tales.
708065 When you were "younger", huh?
708066 Well, I was younger on the way here!
708000 [beat]
708066 It was a long ride! Anyway, as long as we do what the book says, you're pretty much guaranteed a happy ending. Uh, how about this one? "Rescuing a damsel-pony-in-distress." That's perfect! Of course, we'll have to improvise without a dragon.
70800a Huh. Too bad Spike isn't here. Not that he's very threatening.
708080 [laughing]
708065 So what should we do? Wait around for Sugar Belle to get herself into a scary situation?
70800a Or... we bring the danger to her.
708026 [gulps]
70800a All right. Scootaloo's gonna pretend to take Sugar Belle's things, then you swoop in and stop her. Ready?
708000 [beat]
708026 Nnope.
708066 Come on! You're gonna be her hero! In fairy tales, the knight in shining armor always gets the girl.
708026 Hmmm... Mm-hmm.
70827f Oh! Somepony, help!
708000 [screeching]
708000 [slow motion sounds]
7083ba Here's your sugar, Sugar. Though it is not as sweet... [chuckling] ...as you.
7083bb [swoon]
70827f [sighs] Thank you, Feather!
70800a That smooth-talkin' pony stole our rescue! And it totally would've worked!
708026 [angry] Eeyup.
708066 We're just gonna have to keep trying! Big Mac, are you ready to take it up a notch?
708026 Oh, yup!
708026 Oh, nope.
708066 Trust us! There's nothing more romantic than waking your special pony from a sleeping spell with a magical kiss! See? "They rode off into the sunset."
708080 [sigh]
70800a Any sign of Feather Bangs?
708065 Negative! Coast is clear!
70800a It's now or never, Big Mac!
708026 [gulps, nervous sounds, puckering]
70827f [gasps]
7083ba Oh-ho-ho, girl, you been workin' hard all day. Allow me to treat you like the princess... [chuckling] ...you are.
708026 [nickers]
7083bb [swoon]
708066 Hey! That's our metaphorical sunset they're riding off into!
708065 All right! This ends now! Feather Bangs may have good timing, and... a good mane... uh, but let's see him compete with a song!
708026 S-Say what now?
70800a Of course! Why didn't we think of it before?
708066 Every great love story hinges on the romantic musical number. Big Mac, you've gotta write a song for Sugar Belle!
708026 Eeyup.
708000 [hoofbump]
70800a Come on, Big Mac!
7083bc [Valley girl accent] Feather Bangs is soooo romantic.
7083bd [Valley girl accent] When he speaks, I pretend he's talking to me.
708026 [sighs]
70800a Come on! You can do better than him! Just like we practiced!
708026 [gulps]
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 We'll take a walk down by the river
708026 Watch the sunset from the field
708026 We'll plant the seeds of love together
708026 And water 'em right for a really good yield
708026 Sugar Belle, sweet as pie
708026 You're the apple of my eye
708026 A cherry blossom in a field of rye
708026 And when the heifer's milked and fed
708026 And the pigs are in the sty
708026 Won't you be there by my side?
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
7083ba Oh, oh
7083ba Oh, ah-oh
7083ba When you appeared before me
7083ba My heart stopped beating
7083ba Stars crossed the sky
7083ba To come see what I was seeing
7083ba You were the one
7083ba That made me believe I could fly
7083ba Whoa, whoa, whoa
7083ba Birds could not sing
7083ba A song that's as beautiful
7083ba I'd do anything
7083ba That's irrefutable
7083ba 'Cause you are the sun
7083ba Painting my heart in the sky (whoa-oh, oh)
7083ba Sugar, Sugar Belle, whoa-oh
7083ba When will you tell me that you feel the same?
7083ba Like an angel on a candy cane
7083ba Or the sunlight shining through a drain
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 Sugar Belle, when I look in your eyes
708000 [clears throat]
708000 I see the color blue
708000 And it reminds me of the sky above
708000 Uh, which is also... blue
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
7083ba Hey, hey, hey, yeah
7083ba Be my sugarplum
7083ba I will be your watermelon
7083ba Every time you smile
7083ba I can feel my heart a-swellin'
7083ba Blood is rushing from my head to my hooves, yeah
7083ba I start movin' when I'm feeling that groove, yeah
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 I've been writin' this song for you
708026 Searchin' for the perfect rhyme
708026 For the words I wanna say
708026 Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin'... Be mine
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
708000 [Michael Jackson sounds]
708000 [autotuned] Every day I see you
708000 I know you could be the one for me
708000 Feel my heart a-beating like
708000 The rain upon a bumblebee
708000 Don't you see that I could, ah oh, ah oh
708000 Whenever you are near me, I'm so... ah-oh
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 Sugar Belle!
708026 Roses are red and violets are blue!
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
7083ba Sugar, Sugar!
7083ba My love is burning hot like a cheese fondue!
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 Sugar Belle!
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
7083ba Sugar Belle!
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 Sugar Belle!
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
7083ba Sugar Belle!
708026 [Big McIntosh]
708026 Sugar Belle!
7083ba [Feather Bangs]
7083ba Sugar Belle!
708000 [Big McIntosh and Feather Bangs]
708000 Sugar Belle!
708000 [crash!]
708000 [splat]
70827f What in Equestria has gotten into you two?! If you think I'm the kind of pony that likes all this nonsense, then you clearly don't know me at all! I wish everypony would just... leave me alone!
7083ba [whimper]
708000 [splat]
70800a Big Mac? Oh, Big Mac?!
708065 Well, nopony's seen him.
70800a Aw, I feel terrible. I've never seen my brother so upset before. Oh, Big Mac?! Big Mac!
708066 Are you okay?
708026 Nnope.
70800a Sorry it didn't work out with Sugar Belle.
708066 We don't get it. Big, grand gestures always work in the fairy tales.
708026 But Sugar Belle's not a fairy tale princess. She's a real pony. She's kind, and she works hard, and she's sweeter than everything in her bakery.
70800a That's it! We shoulda been thinking about what would mean a lot to Sugar Belle!
708026 Hmmm... [gasps] I know just the thing! But I'm gonna need your help!
70800a Really? Even after we messed it up?
708026 Eeyup. Come on!
708000 [spy music]
708065 [fake voice] Hello! My name's Shimmering Spectacles, and I'm a librarian with a mysterious past. [chuckles]
70827f Oh, okay. I'm... Wait a minute. You look familiar.
708065 [fake voice] I shouldn't. Um, uh, I'm new in town. Mind showing me around?
70827f Uh, sure. That's the whole town. It's just the one street.
708065 [fake voice] Oh, no! Clumsy me! Here, let me help you clean it up!
708066 I don't think Scootaloo can hold her off much longer.
708000 [construction noises]
708065 [fake voice] Uh, n-now hold on a minute. Are you sure I can't buy you a new bag?
70827f I'm good. It's no big deal.
708065 [fake voice] But, u-um, umm... [gulps]
70827f Okay, what's going on?
708000 [door opens]
708065 [normal voice] Ahhh! The cupcake has landed! Repeat – the cupcake has landed! Oof!
70827f Big Mac! You made me a new display case?
708026 Eeyup.
70827f And you made it bigger! You remembered! [gasps] Now I have twice as much room for all my desserts! [gasps] Which means... I can make even more! I've been dying to try baking cream pies and whoopie pies and icebox cakes and, of course, more apple treats! Oh, Big Mac, thank you so much. This is the sweetest thing anypony's ever done for me.
708026 [chuckles] Uh, y-y-yeah or-or nope or...
70827f [giggles] I like you, too.
708026 [sighs]
708080 Awwwww!
70800a That was the most romantic thing ever!
70827f Wait a minute. I recognize you fillies. [to Big Mac] Have they been with you this whole time?
708026 Ee—
70800a I'm Big Mac's little sister, and these are my friends. We're sorry for everything we put you through today, Sugar Belle. Big Mac never would've gone through with all of those crazy...
708066 ...over-the-top...
708065 ...downright ridiculous...
70800a ...attempts to impress you if we hadn't put him up to it. But we learned our lesson. Romance isn't about impressin' somepony. It's about doin' somethin' that means somethin' special to that pony you love— Heh... [clears throat] like a lot.
708066 Uh, Apple Bloom, I think they get it.
7083be [chuckling]
7083ba [singing] Sugar Be-eee-eee-elle...! [vocalizing] Yeah.
708065 Sorry, Feather. You're a little too late.
70800a Yeah! Sugar Belle's already picked her special somepony!
708066 But don't worry. You've got three not-so-secret admirers right behind you!
7083bb [swoon]
7083ba [nervous laugh] What should I say to them?
70800a Uh, you're askin' us for advice?
7083ba Uh-huh. Look, I-I can mane flip, write poetry, and juggle, but actually talkin' to a pony? Oh, it scares me almost as much as loneliness. Will you help me? Please?
70800a Gee, I don't know about this.
708065 He just needs a little nudge in the conversation department. Besides, I don't think Big Mac's ready to leave just yet.
708066 Let's do it!
70800a Feather Bangs, the Cutie Mark Crusaders are...
708080 ...at your service! [laugh]
7083ba [laughs]
708000 [credits]
70900d Oh, thank you so much for helping me with these flyers, Spike. I'm so lucky you just happened to be walking past the boutique. [chuckles]
709005 Uh, yeah, right. Just happened to be walking past. [chuckles nervously]
709007 Whatcha got here? Lost dog? Balloons for sale? Guitar lessons? 'Cause I found one, I need some, and yes, I am interested! [imitating guitar riff]
70900d No. [chuckling] It's a call for submissions. Fashion contest I'm organizing. A showcase for aspiring young designers.
709007 Oh, wow! What an awesome idea!
70900d Thank you. I remember how difficult it was to break into the fashion industry when I was starting out. That's why the winner of the contest will get to debut their line in the Carousel Boutique!
709005 [dreamily] So selfless... So generous...
70900d I've also managed to get esteemed fashion critic Hoity Toity and iconic fashion photographer Photo Finish to come to Ponyville and judge the show. And... [squealing] Wait until you hear who else will be a judge.
709005 Countess Coloratura?
709007 Sassy Saddles?
709005 Spike?!
70900d No! [chuckling] The third judge for the Carousel Boutique's Couture du Future Fashion Contest is none other than... Applejack!
709008 What?!
709007 What?!
709005 What?!
70900d ...What?
709000 [theme song]
709008 What?!
70900d You already said that, darling.
709008 I know. But I had to say it again because that's how confused I am. You want me to judge a fashion show?
709007 I'm sure Rarity has her reasons, and once we hear them, all of this will make sense.
70900d I admit, Applejack is an unorthodox choice. But that is precisely what makes her an inspired choice!
709007 See? Now it all... still doesn't make any sense.
70900d Hoity Toity has expertise in fabric and stitchwork. Photo Finish has an artistic eye for shapes and colors. But sometimes, we designers forget about practicality. That's where you come in.
709008 Uh, I think I might be a little too practical. My closet's nothin' but twenty versions of this hat.
70900d Which tells me you're a pony who knows what she likes. Besides, a judge must be honest, and you're the most honest pony there is. Ask any pony – they'll tell you.
709007 Ooh! Ooh! Lemme try! [to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me. Have you ever heard of Applejack?
7090be The most honest pony there is? Sure have!
70900d See? So what do you say?
709008 Well, if I'm bein' honest, I don't think I'm the right pony for the job. Fashion just ain't my bag of oats.
709007 Aw, booooo!
70900d I do understand your hesitation. But before you say no, sleep on it?
709008 Sure, I... guess I can do that for ya.
709000 [shimmering magic sounds]
709008 Yeah, I know, Big Mac. I-I was just as surprised as you are. [grunts]
709000 [apples thudding]
709008 I mean, heh, can you imagine? Me, judgin' a fashion show?
709000 [pause]
70900a I'd do it! It sounds like fun gettin' to see all those pretty outfits!
709008 Well, you're the exception in our family, sugarcube. You know about that kind o' stuff. I'd be as useful as a burned knot on a zapplin' tree. [grunts]
709000 [apples thudding]
709008 Although... Rarity did say I just had to focus on practicality. She already has experts for the... uh, fashion-y stuff. Eh, but I still wouldn't know what to say.
709000 [thunk]
709000 [thud]
709000 [apples thudding]
709008 Come on, Apple Bloom! You're doublin' our workload here!
70900a Sorry. I wanted to wear a signature hat like yours, but it's makin' it harder to see.
709008 That's because it's not like mine. [grunts] You don't need a fancy scarf to keep your hat on. Now you can see. [grunts]
709000 [apples thudding]
70900a Wow! That is a lot better! Thanks, Applejack!
709008 Sure thing. You know what? I am gonna help Rarity judge her show! I think my sensible "everypony" take on fashion is exactly what the pony community needs!
709000 [bell rings]
709008 Rarity, I thought about it some more, and if you still need me, I'd love to be a judge.
70900d [squeals] I just knew you'd come around!
709093 I, Photo Finish, have arrived!
70906e As has Hoity Toity.
70900d [gasps] It's wonderful to see you! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
709093 [simultaneously] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
70900d Thank you both so much for doing this. Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
70906e We missed you at Miss Pommel's debut in Manehattan last week.
70900d Miss Pommel is showing? I thought she was still making costumes.
709093 You haven't heard? Everypony who's anypony is talking about it. [clop, clop]
709000 [shimmering magic sounds]
70900d Oh, my, they're absolutely stunning!
709008 It sure is great to hear Miss Pommel is doin' so well.
709093 Who is this?! Who speaks?!
70900d Oh, uh, this is Applejack. Another one of the judges.
70906e So, judge, what do you think?
709008 Oh. Wow. Uh, that is just... wow. These are clothes?
709000 [music winds down]
709093 Ze photo is upside-down!
709008 This is... [scoffs] She looks like a disco ball! Hah! D-Did they have to roll her down the runway?! [laughing] I can't believe anypony would actually wear this! [laughing] Am I right?
70906e Oh, my!
709093 I faint! Ugh...
70900d [nervous chuckling] So funny... Ahem.
709008 Oh, gosh. I didn't mean to make her faint.
70900d Oh, don't worry about it, darling. Uh, it happens all the time. Besides, that dress did look a bit like a disco ball. Although, Miss Pommel is making the point that, no matter what we wear, it is a costume of some kind or another.
709008 I have no idea what you're talkin' about.
70900d And... that's okay. Let's go meet the designers and help them get ready for the show!
70900d Designers, welcome! Today you will work on your designs, and we judges will offer our guidance and advice as you prepare for tomorrow's big show.
7093bf [excited murmuring]
70900d Lily Lace, tell us about your inspiration.
7093c1 [Valley girl accent] You guys, this morning, on my way here, I heard a bird singing literally the most beautiful song I'd ever heard! And I wanted to capture not so much the bird's song exactly but more like how the wind carried the bird's song!
70906e Powerful yet at the same time fragile and delicate.
709008 Uh... Huh?
70900d Next up, meet Starstreak.
7093c2 [panting] I'm not interested in what's already been done. Only what will exist... in the future!
70906e Mmmm... Tomorrow's fashion belongs to those who hear it coming.
7093c0 I am Inky Rose.
709000 [pause]
709093 You have a very focused vision! A strong sense of what you want! It's gut!
70900d Applejack, you've been rather quiet. What do you think?
709008 Well... it's a lot of black. It's kinda... depressing.
7093c0 How's this?
70906e Makes a world of difference!
709008 Maybe to fashion experts like you. But to ponies like me, it's still black.
7093c3 [gasps]
709008 And I'm not sure how you wear singin' birds or the future. [to Rarity] I don't think they liked what I had to say.
70900d Ah, well, that's why you're here. Fashion needs a healthy dose of practicality now and then.
709000 [hammering]
709000 [rip]
709008 Are you puttin' holes in the clothes?! On purpose?!
7093c0 It's to create a distressed look.
709008 More like an old and tattered look! When a pony's old clothes get holes in 'em, they don't wanna go to the store to buy new clothes with holes in 'em!
70900d Okay, yes, not a very practical choice. Fashionable, but not practical.
709093 Simply shtunning!
709008 Sure, it looks pretty, but that's a lot of fabric. With the way it drags behind, it'll be covered in dirt in no time. Thank goodness I'm here. Otherwise, we'd have had holes in clothes and dirty dresses.
7093c1 [whimper]
709008 [groans]
70900d But of course, no look is complete without mane and makeup!
709008 So, uh... when are you gonna do her mane?
7093c2 Ugh! It's already been done!
70900d You know what? Uh, I think we've given the designers enough guidance for today. Let's, uh, let them finish their work.
709008 Uh, can't wait to see what y'all do for the big show tomorrow!
7093c1 I literally don't know why...
7093c2 [simultaneously] I am so offended.
7093c0 [simultaneous grumbling] That was so insensitive...
70900d [chuckling nervously, sighs]
709000 [acoustic guitar chord]
709007 Hey, Applejack! On your way home? How'd the first day of the contest go?
709008 Heh! Great! At first, I didn't think I'd be much help. But thank goodness I signed on! Without me, they'd be doin' all kinds of crazy fashion-y things!
709000 [off-key guitar chord]
709007 Hey, Rarity! Applejack says the contest is going great! Good thing she's there, huh?
70900d Yes, of course... Some of her thoughts are tough to swallow, but hopefully her candor will help the designers achieve the best designs possible.
709007 You seem a little stressed. Wanna try? Music is very relaxing. [strums guitar]
70900d Sure... Hmm.
709000 [hard rock solo]
70900d [sighs] Much better.
709007 [blows]
70900d [inhale, exhale] I can meet my goals. Today is a fresh start. Good morning, everypony! Time for final adjustments before the show!
70906e If buttons could convey sadness, you've done it.
709008 To me, they convey wakin' up an hour early just to button 'em all! And that's if you could reach most of 'em!
709000 [buttons clattering]
7093c0 Is this better?
709008 Heh. There you go! Now when it's cold, you just slide it on ya, and you're set. Like a poncho!
70906e Um... poncho?
7093c1 I attached each feather individually! [laughs] It took me for-literally-ever! [laughs]
70906e Ohhhhh. You used hoof-cross-double-over stitches! [chuckles] They're perfect!
709008 Who cares if it's stitched perfectly? You don't need feathers on your head!
709000 [feathers fluttering]
7093c4 [gasps]
709093 Gasp!
709008 My little sister tried to add some flair to her hat, and guess what it got her – an extra hour of work pickin' apples off the ground!
709093 A good start, but it needs more. No. No. No. Yes!
70906e I'd go with this one.
709093 No, this one!
709008 [chuckling]
709093 Something is funny?
709008 What? Oh, no. Uh, it's just, I mean... Those belts look the same.
70906e Well, that one completely changes the look. This one complements it.
709008 You're kiddin', right?
70900d Is everything okay?
709008 They're havin' a heated debate about those two belts.
70900d Ooh! Both good choices.
709008 No! There is no choice! They're the exact same belt! Ugh! This is so silly! Fashion is ridiculous!
7093c5 [gasps]
70900d You don't mean that!
709008 I do! I'm sorry, but that's my honest opinion!
70906e Well! I never would've come if I knew we were going to be insulted!
709093 We go!
70900d No! Please! Come back!
7093c2 If they're out, I'm out, too. I didn't get into fashion to design boring utilitarian clothes!
7093c1 I want to create elegance and drama! And this is literally the opposite of—! [scoffs] I mean—! [scoffs] I can't even! [guttural scoff]
7093c0 Yeah... no.
70900d [sobbing]
709008 What? I was just bein' honest!
7093b1 [grunting]
70900d Stop everything! There is no show! Take it all down!
709007 Rarity, what's going on? Is everything okay?
70900d No! It is the opposite of okay! The judges have quit! The designers have dropped out! The show is cancelled! All my good intentions squashed! [sobbing] And it's all Applejack's fault!
709008 Why are you mad at me?! I was just sayin' what I thought! And isn't that why you wanted me to be a judge?! For my honesty?!
70900d Of course! But you said fashion is ridiculous!
709008 But it's my opinion! And I'm not gonna lie!
70900d Oh—! [scoffs] Come with me!
709000 [knock, knock!]
709000 [door opens]
7093c6 [chewing] Mmmm! [gulp] Oh! [chuckling] Rarity! Oh, what a nice surprise!
70900d Hello, Strawberry Sunrise. This is Applejack. I was wondering if you could tell her how you feel about apples.
7093c6 Don't like 'em.
709008 What?! Why?! They're crunchy, they're sweet, they're delicious.
7093c6 [chuckles] They're not strawberries. [chewing] Mmmm! [gulp]
709008 You're right! Apples are better than strawberries!
7093c6 Only if, by "better", you mean "better at being disgusting".
709008 [stammering] You'd better apologize!
7093c6 Oh, I'm sorry... that you actually bite into those tasteless, mealyworm-filled things. Ohhh.
709000 [door slams]
709008 What?!? [growling]
70900d Applejack, why are you so angry? It's just Strawberry's honest opinion. What's wrong with that?
709008 Well, that's fine if she doesn't like 'em! But if she knew how hard we worked to make our apples perfect, maybe she wouldn't be so mean about—! ...Ohhhhhhh... Oh, boy.
70900d Mm-hmm. Doesn't feel so good, does it?
709008 Nope. No, it does not at all. [sighs] I am so sorry, Rarity. I got so carried away with bein' honest, I guess I didn't think about how I was makin' others feel. [sighs] I'm a real rotten apple.
70900d I appreciate that, Applejack. That means a lot. I just wish you'd realized it before you ruined the fashion show.
70906e I need to get some of these.
709093 It's the only way to travel.
709000 [rumbling]
709093 What are you doing?!
70906e Canterlot is that way.
709008 Yup. But you're not goin' back to Canterlot yet.
709008 Hey!
7093c1 What is she—?! [scoffs]
7093c2 I don't know.
7093c0 Run.
709008 [panting]
7093bf [panting]
7093c1 I can't even!
709008 Whew... Listen, y'all. I thought I was just bein' honest when I said all those things. But somepony helped me realize I was actually bein' hurtful. So for that, I apologize.
709093 Zo! You don't think fashion is ridiculous?!
709008 Uh... Well, I, uh... I still don't understand it. But I appreciate how much it means to y'all and how much hard work you put into it. I also know this contest is important to Rarity. So what do you say?
70906e Well, I'd hate to have come all this way here and not see what you can do.
7093c2 If they're judging, we're in.
7093c1 Under one condition. Literally.
709008 Anything.
7093c0 Untie us.
709000 [clanking]
709008 Show's back on, fellers!
7093c7 [groaning]
709008 [grunting] Ahhh...
709000 [sewing machine whirring]
709000 [screech]
709000 [muffled humming]
709008 [grunting]
709000 [sewing machine whirring]
709008 Aah!
709000 [fwump!]
709008 [laughing]
7093c2 [laughing]
7093c0 Uh-uh. Uh-huh.
709000 [shimmering magic sounds]
709007 ...And then, Applejack found me and told me to distract you for an hour. But the hour's up! Ta-da!
70900d B-B-But how?! They were all leaving. This was all coming down.
7093c1 You can thank Applejack. She literally did it all by herself.
709008 I don't think that word means what you think it means. But I did bust my tail because I know how much this means to you.
70900d Ohhhhh! Thank you, Applejack.
709093 We start now!
709000 [techno music]
70900d First up, Lily Lace!
709000 [camera clicking]
70900d Starstreak!
709000 [camera clicking]
70900d Inky Rose!
709000 [camera clicking]
70900d And now, it's time to vote. I am drawn to the beauty and drama of fashion, and nopony does drama better than Lily Lace, so I vote for her.
7093c1 It means sooooo much to me! I literally can't even! [guttural scoff]
70906e Simplicity is the keynote of true elegance. That is why I vote for Inky Rose.
7093c0 You've... made me so... happy?
709093 Fashion is the art! I, Photo Finish, vote for Starstreak!
7093c2 Wonderful to hear, darling.
70900d Well, it all comes down to you, Applejack.
709007 Can you believe it?! After everything that's happened, Applejack is the deciding vote! [screams] This is so exciting! Eeeeee!
70900d Well, Applejack?
709008 [sucks air through teeth] Uh... Heh. U-Uh... Uh...
70900d Lily Lace's clothes go here, Inky Rose's will go there, and Starstreak's there.
709008 Sorry, but I couldn't pick just one. They all did great, and in my opinion, they all deserve to win.
70900d And I agree. I told you your perspective would be beneficial.
709008 Is, uh, this one of your new designs, Rarity? It's, uh... Uh, the form is... reminiscent of, uh... I mean, it conjures up images of... uh... well, uh... I-I mean...
70900d Oh, that? No! I totally messed that one up! It's ghastly! Horrid! Absolutely terrible!
709008 Hah. Oh, thank goodness. 'Cause in my honest opinion... it's awful.
70900d Pffft!
709043 [laughing]
70900d When you're right, you're right!
709008 I am relieved!
709000 [credits]
710003 [strained gasping]
71027c I know! I can't believe it either! The map has never called me before!
710005 I'm sure that's not why she looks... like that.
710003 [babbles] Actually, it is. Well, it's that and the fact that you're being called to the royal palace! I mean, what in Equestria could be going on there?! You want me to come with you?! No. I shouldn't. The map just called you for a reason, right? Heh. Though maybe it's a mistake. Not because of you! Because it's never called just one of us before. [nervous chuckle]
71027c I also wasn't nervous before, but now...
710003 Don't worry. For all we know, it's something small. Like maybe the cooks are fighting over who has the best butternut squash soup. Or the royal hairdressers are fighting over a comb.
710005 Or, you know, maybe the royal sisters aren't seeing eye-to-eye on something.
710003 No! That's just crazy! Luna and Celestia would never fight. [beat] Again.
710019 So the map sent you to solve a friendship problem?
71027c Yes, princess.
710019 Well, there's nothing wrong here. Right, sister?
71001a [sourly] No. Everything's perfect as usual, sister.
710000 [theme song]
710000 [door opens]
710000 [door closes]
71027c [groans]
710003 Psst! Pssst!
710000 [music box playing]
71027c Twilight? Is that you? How are you here?
710003 [quickly] I'm not. I'm still home. It's an easy spell. I'll show you later. Anyway, enough about me. I had to check on you. Not in a meddling kind of way! In a friendly "how's it going?" kind of way. So, how's it going?
71027c [sighs] Not great. I think the problem might be between Celestia and Luna.
710003 Oh, no, that's terrible! I mean, what makes you say that?
71027c You know how some ponies say nothing's wrong but you can tell something's definitely wrong?
710003 [nervously] Noooooo... Heh.
71027c That's basically what the princesses did when I said there was a friendship problem. Only they did it more, you know, regally.
710003 Oh, I wish I could help you, but I can't – both for map reasons and because I have no idea! This is big! Like, really big! But I'm here if you ever need to talk. Or listen to music.
710000 [music box playing]
710003 Heh. Comforting, right?
71027c [groans]
71027c Thank you so much for breakfast, princess. I can't believe you cook it yourself.
710019 Of course, Starlight! I really enjoy doing it. It's a small way to say I care.
710000 [door opens]
710019 Good morning, sister! Join us?
71001a [sourly] Too tired. [chomp] Please excuse me.
71027c Wow. Last night must've been really hard on her.
710019 [sighs] Perhaps. But she is like this every morning.
710000 [clatter]
71027c So I think Luna may be hurting her sister's feelings without even realizing it.
710003 Poor Celestia. That's so sweet that she makes her sister pancakes every morning.
71027c She's your mentor. I think you might be biased.
710003 Fair enough. So what are you gonna do?
71027c Nothing, yet. I have to get all the facts. I asked Luna if I could spend some time with her this evening.
710000 [knock, knock, knock]
710000 [door opens]
7100ac Princess Luna's waiting for you, miss.
71027c [chuckling nervously]
710003 Good luck, Starlight!
7100ac [surprised whinny]
710000 [door closes]
71027c Wow, Princess Luna. You do this every night?
71001a Lavender's calming scent is known to aid dreamers in achieving a restorative sleep.
71027c [sniffs] That's so thoughtful!
71001a I try my best to make sure the ponies in this castle sleep peacefully.
710000 [door opens]
7101ac And so, then I said, "Touring? More like 'boring'!" [airy laughter]
710019 [laughs] Oh, you really are a card!
71001a [sighs] But as always, my sister is too busy having fun with dignitary ponies to acknowledge anything I do. Hmph!
71027c So, both princesses are hurting each other without realizing it. And instead of talking about it, they're just getting colder and more distant.
710003 And they're Celestia and Luna. So it's not like you can just confront them.
71027c Actually, that's exactly what I was gonna do.
710003 What?! Are you crazy?! I mean, heh, you do whatever you think is best. This is your mission.
71027c [sarcastically] Gee, thanks for believing in me, Twilight.
710003 I do. But the last time the princesses fought, Luna turned into Nightmare Moon, and Princess Celestia had to banish her for a thousand years! That can't happen again!
71027c Well, I can't do nothing. The princesses aren't the best at communicating with each other.
710003 [gasps] Sorry. It's just, you said "princesses" and "aren't the best" in the same sentence, and it's making me nervous!
710000 [thud]
710003 I'm not much help, am I?
71027c No!
71027c Wow. I almost feel bad eating this. It's adorable.
710019 Like I said, I enjoy this part.
710000 [door opens]
71001a [sourly, mouth full] Hi.
71027c Uh, Princess Luna! Wait! [deep breath] As you both know, the map sent me here for a reason, and I... think I found out what it is.
710019 Really? Oh, that is wonderful, Starlight! What is it?
71027c You two.
710019 Excuse me?
71001a [simultaneous] I beg your pardon?
71027c I think you're accidentally hurting each other's feelings without realizing it. Princess Celestia, does it bother you that Luna never notices the wonderful breakfasts that you prepare for her?
710019 Uh... Y-Yes. It does.
71027c Princess Luna, tell Celestia how you feel about the fact that she never acknowledges the work you put into lining the hallway with lavender every night.
71001a I... Well, I... I-It's not the best feeling. [to Celestia] I'm sorry I never noticed that you make fruit faces on pancakes, but nights are long for me. You might be a morning pony, but I am half-asleep.
710019 You think I don't get tired? I'm exhausted! Oh, I apologize for not noticing flowers in a wall sconce. But by the time I get to retire for the night, I can barely see straight! Even so, I still make an effort to smile!
71001a Like smiling is so hard.
71027c I-I-I'm sure that's not what Princess Luna meant to say.
71001a Is that what exhausts you? Smiling and being adored by everypony?
710019 And you have it so much worse, do you?! You've spent your evenings flitting around giving ponies lovely dreams! Oh, it sounds just awful!
71027c [chuckles] Okay! I feel like we should step back, take a deep breath...
71001a Don't presume to know what it is like to govern the dream realm!
710019 And yet you know exactly what it's like to be me?! Oh, please!
71027c Enough!
710000 [shimmering magic sounds]
71027c There! Now you'll know exactly what it's like to... be each other. [gulp]
710019 [gasps] What have you done?!
71027c I... went with my gut?
71001a Switch our cutie marks back this instant!
71027c My apologies, Your Majesties! But I can't, even if I wanted to. The spell lasts twenty-four hours. I-It may have been extreme, but, uh, I think it's still a good idea?
710019 [serious] What?
71027c Y-You said it yourselves! Neither of you believes your sister knows how hard it is to be you. So this is your chance to prove it.
71001a Well, I could use an easy day followed by a good night's sleep.
710019 You can try. I haven't had an easy day in, well, ever! But now, I get to sleep, and tonight will be a breeze. All right, Starlight Glimmer. We will do this.
71027c Good choice! Not that you had one. [chuckles]
710268 [snort]
71027c I'm gonna stop talking now.
710003 [hyperventilating] You switched their cutie marks?! The actual princesses' cutie marks?!
71027c [groans] I thought we moved past this. It was the right call! I hope.
710003 [hyperventilating]
710000 [pounding on door]
7100ac Are you okay in there?
71027c I-I'm good! Just, uh... reading an exciting book! [whispering to Twilight] He's gonna think I'm nuts!
710003 He's not the only one.
710000 [drawer opens]
710000 [drawer slams]
71001a As you can see, Celestia and I are switching places today.
710000 [confused murmuring]
71001a I assure you, I am more than capable of handling all of Celestia's, heh, duties. Dismissed.
710000 [nervous murmuring]
71001a So, what is first on my dear sister's to-do list?
71027c It says you have a few public appearances. Store openings, judging the royal rose contest... You know, that sort of thing.
71001a [chuckles] Oh, I knew today would be easy, but I didn't think it would be that easy.
710000 [happy montage music]
710000 [scissors clipping]
710000 [applause]
71001a [sniffing]
710000 [whiffle!]
71001a [creaking]
710000 [camera clicks]
71001a "Princess Luna Unhappy with Student Fundraiser"? But I wasn't unhappy!
71027c Um, you are scowling.
71001a Well, I-I didn't mean to! I've been smiling all day! My cheeks hurt! I stopped for one second! And that's when he took the picture!
71027c Guess smiling all day isn't as easy as you thought?
71001a It says here that, because of me, the school didn't raise enough funds to go on their field trip! I-I didn't mean for that to happen!
710000 [thud]
71027c I know. But you can't dwell on that now. According to the list, some delegates are about to arrive for a luncheon. You need to dispel rumors of timberwolves in the White Tail Woods. The nearby towns have been in a state of panic for weeks.
71001a B-B-But I have to fix this!
71027c You can't. You need to put on a brave face and help these ponies. It's what Celestia would do.
710000 [door opens]
71001a [deep breath, shouting] Hello! Great news! There are no timberwolves!
710000 [slam]
7103c8 No, there are definitely timberwolves!
71001a I'm sorry. But I couldn't stop thinking about those poor students. Normally, I have all the time in solitude I need to work through my problems at my own pace.
71027c Well, your sister doesn't get that luxury.
7103c9 [muffled] The princess will definitely side with me!
7103ca [simultaneous, muffled] Please see reason, Mayor Cream Cheese! I'm telling you, Baltimare...
71027c Ready for the town hall?
71001a [sighs]
7103cb [continued arguing]
7103ca Glad that's settled.
7103c9 [chuckles] And it only took three hours.
7103ca That got heated, didn't it?
7103c9 Still on for golf?
7103ca Oh, absolutely.
7103c9 [chuckles]
71027c You made it to the end of the day. Yay?
71001a Hmm? Oh. Yes, uh... [yawns] I'm just going to turn in, then. Good light, Starnight. [yawns]
710019 Oh, hello, Starlight. I don't know about you, but I feel very well-rested. Where's Luna?
71027c Um, uh, she already turned in for the night.
710019 Did she now? It seems my duties were harder than my sister expected.
710019 Moon raised! It's even easier than raising the sun. [chuckles] What's next?
71027c [snoring]
710019 Of course. Everypony's asleep at night. Heh. Luna works alone... Oh, but it's nothing I can't handle. All I have to do is watch over Equestria, visit the dream realm, and protect ponies in their nightmares. My list was three times as long! [chuckles]
710000 [lightswitches clicking]
710019 All right. Everypony's asleep. You're talking to yourself, Celestia. Heh. But there's nopony else to talk to! [chuckles] Yet. I can talk to ponies in their dreams!
710000 [vooooom]
710000 [whimsical music]
710019 Now, to save some ponies from their nightmares. Which aren't real, so it shouldn't be too hard, right? Right. Good call, Celestia! And I'm talking to myself again.
71027c [screaming]
7103cc [in Celestia's voice] I care. I care. I care. [distorted] I care.
71027c [screaming] Ugh! No!
710003 This is big! Like, really big!
71027c [yelping]
710019 Starlight! I'm here now. Tell me what's wrong.
71027c [panting] Going with my gut was the wrong call! I was supposed to bring you two closer together! But I've only driven you apart! If you two can't see why you need each other, then—!
710011 Then I am back! [laughing evilly]
710019 Don't worry, Starlight. I know how to handle Nightmare Moon.
7103cd Yes! But can you handle... me?! [laughing evilly]
7103cd [laughing evilly]
710019 This can't be!
7103cd If Luna can turn into Nightmare Moon, you can absolutely turn into me — Daybreaker! The better, prettier, and more powerful version of you!
710019 No! I'll never turn into you!
7103cd Deep inside, you know how powerful you are. You don't need Luna.
710019 That's not true! Even when we were apart, I knew I needed her!
7103cd [laughs] Oh, please! You don't need anypony! You can do whatever you want. And all you have to do is get rid of anypony who stands in your way!
710000 [magic zap]
7103cd I never should've banished you to the moon! I should've destroyed you!
71027c No, you can't do that! Day, night, sun, moon — Equestria needs both of you!
710000 [magic zap]
71027c Without balance, there's no harmony!
710000 [boom!]
710011 [growls]
7103cd Who needs balance when you can have it all?! [laughs]
710000 [magic zap]
7103cd Ugh!
710011 You can't get rid of me so easily, sister! Unless you plan on smiling me to smithereens!
710019 Enough!
7103cd [laughs] I told you I was more powerful than you!
710000 [magic humming]
7103cd Ugh. So much black. We get it. You're sad. You could really use some... sun!
710000 [flames roaring]
71027c [gasps]
710000 [shimmering magic sounds]
710000 [flames roaring]
7103ce [grunting]
71027c This is all my fault! I never should've gone on this mission! Now Equestria is doomed!
7103cf [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
7103d0 Why don't you want us to go on our field trip?
71001a [through teeth gaps] I don't...!
710000 [teeth clattering]
71001a I mean, I do!
7103cf [singsongy] That smile's too wide... It's obviously not real...
71001a Celestia! I'm so glad you're...!
710000 [magic zaps]
71001a [speaking normally] I've seen a lot, but I haven't seen this before.
710019 It's Starlight Glimmer's. She's afraid this is what will happen if we continue to fight!
71027c [sobbing] What was I thinking?! I'm never going with my gut again!
71001a If you don't fix this soon, it could have a grave consequence on Starlight's psyche.
710019 But my magic isn't powerful enough! I thought if we worked together...!
71001a I have your magic, remember? It doesn't work in the dream realm. It has to be you!
710019 Oh, Luna, I can't do this! I was wrong! Your job is so incredibly hard! You have to battle nightmares and work in the darkness and do it all alone! It takes such a brave, strong pony to do what you do!
71001a And that pony is you. I walked a day in your shoes. I thought all you had to do was smile and be adored all the time, but I was wrong. There is so much more to it than that.
7103cd [laughing maniacally]
710000 [magic zaps]
710011 [screams] Ugh!
7103cd [laughing maniacally]
710000 [flames roaring]
71027c Don't do this to each other!
71001a In order to defeat Daybreaker, you need only to trust in your strength as I do.
710000 [magic zaps]
7103cd You can't destroy me! I'm everything you want to be!
710019 No, you're not! You are not real, and you will never exist again!
7103cd [groans]
710000 [pop!]
71001a You did it!
710019 Only because you were here. I don't know how you do this alone.
71001a So, um, did you talk to yourself?
710019 Um, a little.
710268 [laughing]
71027c Is this really happening, or is this still a dream?
710000 [vooooom]
71001a Welcome back, sister! I know you had a long night, so I made you some pancakes!
710019 Oh! Heh. H-How... eh, nice. Ahem. [chews, gags, gulps] They're... delicious. Heh. Thank you.
71001a [laughs] I know that face! They're not. I know you have to be perfect for everypony else, and you do an amazing job. But you don't have to do it for me.
710019 In that case, they are terrible!
710268 [laughing]
71001a I know!
710019 [sighs] But it means a lot that you tried. I love you, sister.
71001a I love you too.
71027c So... this was real. [yawns] Or... was it not real, and this just happened now and-and not in my dream? I'm so confused.
710019 [laughing] It's all real. It was the right call going with your gut.
71001a The map was wise to send you, Starlight. Nopony else would have been so bold as to do what you did.
71027c That's a nice way of saying I came dangerously close to messing everything up.
710019 It was just what we needed. The experience has made us closer than ever.
710000 [shimmering magic sounds]
71027c Wait. I'm not doing this.
710000 [cutie mark ringing]
710019 I believe that one means your mission is complete.
71027c Wow! I can't wait to tell Twilight!
710000 [teleportation zap]
710003 [quickly] I already know! I mean, I don't know everything. I just got here to bring you your toothbrush! So this is just a friendly visit! Not interfering because I was worried! I wasn't! I knew you could do it, and I'm so, so, so, so, so proud of you! Tell me everything! Start from after I hyperventilated, and don't leave out any details!
71001a Oh, uh, by the way, there's a field trip you need to make happen and a – ahem – timberwolf issue you need to address.
710019 W-What?
71001a Oh! Look! There's the sun! Time for me to turn in!
710000 [credits]
711000 [ponies chattering]
711007 Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh!
711000 [zoom!]
711007 Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! Sorry, Applejack!
711007 Twilight! Twilight! Where are you?!
711003 I'm in here, Pinkie! What is it?
711007 You'll never guess what I just got!
711000 [door opens]
711008 Is everythin' okay? We heard a lot of "oh-my-gosh"-in', and we weren't sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing.
711007 A good thing!
711003 [reading] "To pink pony who lives with baked goods." It's from the yaks! [reading] "Yaks cordially invite pink pony to Yickslurbertfest. Come. Now."
711007 Prince Rutherford is officially inviting me to Yickslurbertfest in Yakyakistan!
71100d What is Yickslurbertfest?
711003 It's a sacred yak holiday. How did you get Prince Rutherford to invite you?
711007 I subtly hinted for an invitation in my letters to him.
711007 [voiceover] May I please come to Yickslurbertfest? Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty-pretty please?!
711007 After my seventeenth scroll, I think he picked up what I was putting down. [giggling excitedly]
711000 [theme song]
711007 [giggling excitedly]
711003 You know, we still don't know a lot about the yaks. So I think you should definitely go to Yickslurbertfest, Pinkie.
711053 [general agreement]
71100e Fostering friendships is what ponies do.
711007 I won't let you down! It's an honor to be the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
711003 Um, that's not an official position.
711007 Yet. You're the princess of friendship. [singsongy] You can make it happen.
711003 Okay, you got it.
711007 Ahem? You have to make it official!
711003 [sighs] Right. I hereby make Pinkie Pie the official friendship ambassador to the yaks!
711007 This is officially the most exciting day of my life!
711007 Yoo-hoo! Gummy! Pay attention! We're in the middle of an official friendship ambassador road trip game!
7110c6 [blink]
711007 That's better. Okay. I spy with my official friendship eye something that is blue!
711000 [long pause]
711007 [gasps] We're here! Oh, and by the way, the answer was sky. I win!
711000 [beat]
711007 Yeah, I know. That was a hard one, Gummy. You're the best official friendship travel companion ever!
711000 [crunch]
711000 [rumbling]
711007 What is going on?
7112b4 Yaks destroy!
7112b6 Yaks destroy!
711007 Yikes!
7112b4 [laughs] Pink pony!
711007 It's an honor to [grunts] be here, prince. Uh, did something terrible happen? Is Yickslurbertfest cancelled?!
7112b4 No! This Yickslurbertfest, where yaks come together to stomp.
711007 Ohhhhh. I didn't know that was part of the sacred holiday. So this angry display of destruction is part of the festivies. Huh. And here I thought you yaks were just in a bad mood.
7112b4 No. Stomping relaxes yaks. [grunting] Yaks' head never been so clear.
7112b6 [grunting]
711007 This is awesome! [grunting]
7112b4 Stop!
7112b6 [grunts]
7112b4 Pink pony better check self before wreck self. That is century-old sacred yak twig, passed down from generation to generation.
711007 [gasps] Oh, no! I'm so sorry! I was just trying to get into the spirit of Yickslurbertfest. [distressed noises] Maybe I can fix it!
7112b4 [snort, laughs] Yak kidding! [grunting] Yak got pink pony good. Horn bump! [grunts]
711007 Phew! Oh, you sure did, Prince Rutherford. [chuckles, to Gummy] That was a close one, Gummy! This trip has to be perfect! After all, we're not just visiting as friends. We're on official friendship ambassador business!
7112b4 Less talking, more stomping!
7113d1 [grunting]
711007 Stompie-stompie-stompie-stompie!
7112b4 Now, I take pink pony on Yakyakistan tour.
711007 Thanks, Prince Rutherford, but, heh, I've been to Yakyakistan before.
7112b4 Yak know. But thought pink pony might not recognize town since decorated for Yickslurbertfest.
711007 You're right! It's so different, now that you've pointed it out. [chuckles]
7112b4 Oh, yaks not just have eye for decorating. Yaks also amazing builders!
711007 [gasps] No way! I thought you hired professional contractors!
711000 [splat]
711007 Here. Uh, let me help you with that.
711000 [splat]
7112b4 This ceremonial yak fire pit, where yaks tell stories.
711007 Oooh! I have so much to officially tell the ponies when I get back.
7112b4 This yak eating hut. Hut where yaks eat.
711007 [slurp, chomp, gulp] Mmmm! The perfect balance of vanilla extract.
7112b4 Yaks grow own vanilla bean. Nothing imported. [chomp, gulp]
7112b6 [chomping and gulping]
711007 [chomp, gulp]
7112b4 Yak sleeping hut. Hut where yaks sleep.
711007 Huh!
711000 [screech]
7112b6 [sleepily muttering and bleating]
711007 [snoring]
7112b4 Yak music hut. Hut where yaks enjoy beautiful music.
711000 [oriental music]
711007 This is beautiful and—!
7112b4 Shhh! Pink pony ruin with talking!
7112b4 ...And that how yaks defeat evil and save world!
711007 [claps, in deep voice] Pink pony like yak story!
7112b4 Ho-ho! Yak impressed! Pink pony can almost be honorary yak.
711007 [speaking normally] Official friendship ambassador and honorary yak?! [squeals] Pink pony's title card is full! [in deep voice] Horn bump! [speaking normally] Oh, wait! I don't have a horn! [gasps] Prince Rutherford, can I get some honorary yak horns?
7112b4 No. Yak horn too heavy for small pony head.
711000 [deep horn sounding]
7112b4 Yickslurbertfest stomp time!
7112b6 [grunting]
711000 [rumbling]
711007 [grunting]
7112b4 Stomp harder! Yaks extra happy! Ponies and yaks friends!
7113d2 [grunting]
711000 [crash]
711007 Is this part of the festival?
7112b4 Pink pony ask too many questions.
711007 Everything is buried in snow! What are we gonna do?!
7112b4 Uhhh... Y-Yaks fine! Snow falls from mountain all the time!
711007 All the time?
7112b4 Every Yickslurbertfest.
711007 Okay. Avalanches like this completely bury all your homes every Yickslurbertfest? Really?
7112b4 This is... big avalanche. But not a problem, for yaks are tough! Yaks dig through snow! Won't take long.
711007 Oh, good. You have an emergency plan in place.
7112b6 [grunting]
711007 Here, let me help!
711000 [drill sounds]
7112b6 [exhausted grunting]
711000 [drill sounds]
711007 Whew. I'm tired. We must be almost done. There's still snow everywhere?!
7112b4 Yaks keep digging!
7112b6 [exhausted grunting]
711000 [rumbling]
711000 [crash]
711007 [whine]
7112b4 Yaks stop digging! Make situation worse!
711007 Okay. Don't worry, Prince Rutherford. I'll go back to Ponyville and ask for help. Twilight and the others will be happy to come dig the snow away. After all, "many hooves make light work." Right, Gummy?
7112b4 Yaks no need pony help!
7112b6 [general agreement]
711007 Oh. Well, I'm sure it'll be okay, 'cause you probably have a Plan B.
7112b4 Yes. Yaks wait for snow to melt.
711007 All this snow?! It'll take a thousand moons before it melts!
7112b4 Yaks known for their patience.
711007 Well... be that as it may, in the meantime, what will you eat? Where will you sleep?
7112b4 Dah! Yaks can make this work! Hardship make yaks the strong yaks that yaks are! If pink pony disagrees, then she can leave Yakyakistan and never return!
711007 [yelps] Uh, of course pink pony agrees with you! [nervous chuckle] Hey, let's try out some snow recipes! [grunting] Snow cakes! Snow spaghetti! Snow sandwiches! [nervous chuckle, chomp] Mmmm! Yaks can make this work!
7112b4 [yawns] Yak tired. Yak retire to new sleeping hut.
7112b6 [shivery snoring]
711000 [crash]
711007 [groans]
7112b6 [chomping]
7112b4 [gulps] Snow cake good!
711007 [chomp, gulp, shiver] Mmmm! Just the right balance of cold and water!
711000 [chomp]
7112b4 Aah! Stop! Yak eating new eating hut!
711007 [whispering] Psst! Prince Rutherford. What are we doing?
7112b4 It's obvious. This new music hut.
711007 Oh. So we're swaying to—
7112b4 Shhh! Pink pony ruin snow music with talking!
711000 [stomach rumbling]
7113d3 What was yak?
7113d4 Yak stomach rumbles. Yak hungry.
7113d3 Shhh! Prince yak will hear yak!
7113d4 But snow worse than yak ever seen!
7113d3 Yak know. Yak hungry, too.
711007 [gasps] Gummy, did you hear that? They can't make it work!
7112b4 Yaks stop swaying! Music over!
711007 If Twilight and the others knew what was going on, they would be here to help in a pony's heartbeat. We have to convince Prince Rutherford that asking for help is okay. Will you help me, Gummy?
7110c6 [low gurgle]
711007 Thank you! And see? Asking you to help wasn't hard at all.
7110c6 [slurp]
711007 Pink pony has gathered you around the new ceremonial yak fire pit to tell you a story! A yak tradition, right?
7112b6 [general agreement]
711007 Yay! This is a story about a group of... uh, goats!
711007 [voiceover] Who lived in the desert. There was a sandstorm, and their entire village was buried in sand. There was nothing they could do. They knew they could not survive by only eating sand...wiches!
711007 [giggles] Get it?
711000 [beat]
711007 ...Okay. Anyway...
711007 [voiceover] Finally, the goats' brave, wise leader – let's just call him Prince... uh... Drutherford [giggles] – decides that they couldn't do it by themselves. So he asked the neighboring town of, uh, Bovineville to come help them. [giggles] Yeah! Cows! The magical cows helped the goats, everyone survived, and lived happily ever after!
711007 Because they asked for help. The end!
7112b6 [cheering]
711007 So what is the moral of that story? Is it – A – asking for help is okay? B – asking for help saves the day? Or – C – asking for help is good for everypony?
7112b4 D – goats weak and horrible! Magic bovines need to stay out of goats' business!
711007 Um... [nervous chuckle] Not quite. Any yak wanna shout out another answer?
711000 [beat]
711007 [whines]
711007 Hey, Prince Rutherford. I wanna talk to you about something. Uh, what are you doing?
7112b4 Uh, yak's snow bed got a little melty last night.
711007 Okay, yeah. That's what I wanna talk to you about. You know, these yak snow beds are the fluffiest I've ever slept in. They're so comfortable, you forget that it's just a cold block of ice. And the yak snow sandwiches? Mm-mmm! I hate it when food burns your mouth or overwhelms it with flavor!
7112b4 Ah! Yak hates that, too!
711007 You know who would really, really enjoy these snow sandwiches? Twilight Sparkle and the other ponies! Oh, hey! I have an idea! Why don't I go to Ponyville and bring them back here?
7112b4 Ponies like snow sandwich?
711007 Oh! Ponies love snow sandwiches! And hey, while they're here, you can ask if they'll clear the snow away. Fun, right?
7112b4 When prince was little yak, prince stomped on ground too hard. Made deep hole and fell into hole. Ice froze over hole. Prince waved to friends and family from inside frozen hole. Waited for spring thaw. Prince survived on own.
711007 W-W-Wait a minute. You spent the whole winter in a hole?
7112b4 Yes. And yak never asked for help!
7113d5 [grunts]
711007 Okay. First of all, how did you make such a deep hole from stomping? And how did it freeze over so fast? And how could you see your family and friends to wave to them from inside a frozen hole? Even if all that was possible, how did you breathe in there?!
711000 [slam!]
7112b4 Yaks don't ask for help!
711007 But the yaks are hungry! And who knows when the snow will melt? I just don't understand why—
7112b4 Ah, yes. Is clear now that pink pony does not understand yaks. Honorary yak status rescinded! Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!
711007 Fine! Be stubborn!
711007 [groans] Those yaks are so stubborn! They refuse to ask for help, even though they need it! Well, this official friendship ambassador is gonna take matters into her own hooves! I'll show them!
711000 [beat]
711007 [sighs] You're right, Gummy. I am too worked up. Road trip game would officially calm me down. I know! Let's play Twenty Million Questions! You think of something, then I'll ask you twenty million questions until I can come up with what you're thinking of! Let's go! Is it blue? Is it green? Is it red? Is it greenish-red? Is it reddish-blue? Is it bigger than a bread box? Is it smaller than a bread box? Is it a bread box? Is it bread?
711007 ...Is it teeth? Is it Granny Smith's dentures? Is it you? Is it a rooster? Is it a red rooster? Is it a red rooster eating corn? Ah! Used up all twenty million questions! Oh, well. We're here anyway.
7112b4 Official pony balloon still here? Pink pony gone because pink pony not tough like yaks! Horn bump in agreement! Now!
7112b6 [grunting]
7112b4 [chomp, chewing] Pleh! Snow sandwich lose novelty! Snow couscous for dinner!
7112b6 [disappointed grunt]
711007 Then Prince Rutherford said, [imitating Prince Rutherford] "Bang! Pretend there is door! I just slammed it!"
711003 Pinkie Pie—
711007 So then pink pony said, [high-pitched] "Fine! Be stubborn!"
711003 Pinkie Pie, we have to help the yaks.
711007 So in conclusion, we have to help the yaks!
711003 Hmm?
711008 Just go with it, hon.
711003 Great idea, Pinkie. We'll be happy to help the yaks. This is what friendship is all about.
711008 Hey! I'll bring apples. This season's batch are extra juicy.
71100d And I shall provide the yaks with Equestria's finest textiles. They'll be silky and warm with hints of gold to complement their horns—
711007 Stop! We can't bring the yaks any pony stuff!
71100e Why not?
711007 The yaks are very proud. They won't ask for help. You know what they say – "you can lead a yak to water, but you better not let him know you're doing it."
71100c Nopony says that. Do they?
711003 Okay then. This'll be an official covert friendship mission.
7111da Mm-hmm!
71100c You got it!
711007 [excited giggling]
711007 Is it yellow? Is it slimy? Is it slimy yellow?
71100c We're not playing that!
711007 First, we have to infiltrate the yak compound. [grunts]
711000 [clang]
711007 These walls are high. Sneaking in will not be easy.
711000 [zoom!]
711007 [grunting]
711000 [gate creaks]
71100c Or it's super-easy 'cause I'm awesome.
711007 Go ahead! I'll catch up! You all know what to do!
711000 [thud]
7112b5 [snoring]
711000 [montage music]
7112b4 [yawns, gasps] What happened?!
7113d6 Snow melted! Prince Rutherford was right!
7112b6 [cheering and laughing]
7112b4 [laughs] Yaks tough! Yaks wait patiently! Yaks win!
711008 Hoo-wee! Helpin' to fix an entire yak village sure takes a lot outta ya.
711003 Let's get out of here before—
7112b4 Oh, pink pony!
711007 [nervous gasping] Just play it cool! [to Prince Rutherford] We didn't help fix Yakyakistan! [nervous chuckle] No, no! We're just here for the snow sandwiches! But then we got here, and the snow was gone, so we thought we'd hit a diner on our way back to Ponyville! Bye-bye!
7112b4 Wait. Yak not mad at pink pony.
711007 Yak not?
7112b4 Pink pony help yaks without yaks asking. Means pink pony understand yaks.
711007 I do? Huh! I do!
7112b4 Pink pony the best kind of friend. Officially honorary yak!
7112b6 [cheering]
711007 Yippee! My own honorary yak horns! Now I can officially horn-bump! Whoa!
711000 [thud]
711007 Yeah... You know, this is a little heavy for my small pony head.
711008 [chuckles] Need some help with that, Pinkie Pie?
711007 [deep voice] Pink pony no need apple pony's help! [giggling and snorting, normally] Just kidding! Pink pony got apple pony good!
711012 [laughing]
711007 Seriously, this is heavy.
711000 [thud]
711000 [credits]
712000 [birds chirping]
7123d7 [laughing]
71200e Care for a carrot-ginger sandwich?
7120db Oh! You remembered to cut off the crusts for me.
71200e Of course I did. I know how you like them.
712000 [pop, pop, pop!]
712000 [poof, poof, poof!]
7120db You really do make the best finger foods.
7123d8 [high-pitched burp]
7120db What do you say?
7123d8 [high-pitched] Excuse me.
7120db [scoffs] I really can't take them anywhere.
71200e [giggles]
712000 [splat!]
7120db Can I trouble you for another sugarcube?
71200e Oh, no. I'm so sorry, but I seem to be out.
7120db Well, I can just pop us in some more.
71200e Oh, that's all right. I need to go to the market anyway. I have to restock my pantry for our tea party next week.
7120db Oh. I never realized how much work you put into hosting these tea parties.
712000 [fluttery music]
71200e Oh, it's really not that much.
7120db No, no, no, no, no! I've been taking advantage of your hospitality for far too long. It's high time I do something about it. What to do, what to do...
7123d9 Why don't you host the next tea party?
7120db I've got it! Why don't I host the next tea party at my place?
7123d9 Hey, that's my idea.
7120db [snaps fingers]
7123d9 Why didn't I see that coming?
712000 [whistle!]
712000 [pop!]
712000 [theme song]
7120db So, Fluttershy. Mmmm! What do you think of my brilliant, genius, amazing idea of having the next tea party at my place? [snaps fingers]
712000 [faucet running]
71200e Are you sure? I wouldn't want you to go through any trouble.
7120db You? Trouble? Never! I insist! [snaps fingers]
712000 [sheep baaing]
71200e Then count me in. I'm already looking forward to it.
7120db Me, too! I'm so excited! I can't wait! No, really, I can't! How about we have the tea party tomorrow afternoon?
71200e Sounds good to me. You know, Discord, I've never been to your house before.
7120db Well, that's okay, because I've never hosted a tea party before.
712000 [boom!]
7120db Oh! I've never hosted a tea party before! So much to do! [sips tea] Thank you so much for the tea and nibblies, but I really must be going!
71200e Uh, Discord? Before you go, would you mind helping me tidy up?
7120db [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db There you go. Back to normal, just the way you like it. See you tomorrow!
712000 [poof!]
712000 [poof!]
7120db I can't wait!
712000 [poof!]
71200e [giggles]
712000 [poof!]
7120db Okay. Since Fluttershy always goes out of her way to host the perfect tea party for me, how do I make my tea party for her even more perfect?
7122e7 I'm sorry, dearie. Were you talking to me?
7120db Actually, madam, I'm talking to myself.
7123d9 Well, I'm not talking to you!
7120db It's for Fluttershy!
7123d9 Oh, all right. No more holes, though. [snaps fingers] You have to knock this tea party out of the park for her. She was our first friend, after all.
7120db You don't have to tell me that. She gave us a chance when no other pony would.
7123d9 She makes us want to be a better draconequus. Fluttershy deserves the best of everything.
7120db Of course! I should get her the best of everything. Why didn't I think of that? ...Well? Are you going to answer me or not?
7122e7 Me? Uh, I thought you were talking to...
7120db No time! I'm off to prepare a tea party worthy of Fluttershy! [snaps fingers]
712000 [jetpack engine whirring]
712000 [poof!]
712000 [poof!]
7120db Excuse me. Is this where Fluttershy usually buys her tea?
7123da Why, yes, it is.
7120db Oh, wonderful! I'll be enjoying her company tomorrow, so I will be needing your very best tea, please. Something especially special.
7123da I'm sure Fluttershy would enjoy some of our rose hip green tea.
7120db [chuckling] Oh, interesting. Does it decorate your hips in roses or turn you green?
7123da Uh... neither? It just tastes good.
7120db How boring. Pass. Hold on! Ginseng tea! Now that sounds promising. What does it sing? I'm partial to something upbeat and jazzy.
7123da Again, it's just tasty like all of our tea here.
7120db So... all of this is just tea you simply drink?
7123da Uh-huh.
7120db Ohhhh, it seems that I got here just in time. [snaps fingers]
712000 [tea bags singing]
7120db [laughs] Singing ginseng! I'll take it!
7123da Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy? You seem so very different from her.
7120db Well, of course we're friends! She gets me, and you obviously do not! [imitating "Jasmine Leaf"] "Are you sure you're friends with Fluttershy?" [scoffs] The very nerve!
712000 [poof!]
712000 [poof!]
7120db I'm sorry. Do you validate?
712000 [poof!]
7120db Hello!
7123db [yelps] Uh, can I help you find something?
7120db Yes, you can. Your finest tea set, please. I want only the best for my friend Fluttershy.
7123db Uh... you're friends with Fluttershy?
7120db Yes... judgy... clerk... pony! Why is it such a surprise? Sure, she's on the quieter side, and I'm a bit, well, more showy. But I'll have you know we're besties. And that's why I need the [echoing] best tea set!
7123db Uh, perhaps then you'd be interested in our classic tea-for-two set.
712000 [tea pouring]
7120db A teapot that just pours tea? How positively dreadful!
7123db But that's all teapots are supposed to do.
7120db Not anymore! [snaps fingers] Much better! Don't wrap it. I'll walk it home. [snaps fingers]
712000 [bits jingle]
7120db Now, let's see. I have the perfect tea and the perfect tea service. What else do I need for the perfect tea party? Oh! Decorations, of course!
7120db Good... but not nearly good enough for Fluttershy. [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7123dc [sneezes]
712000 [volcano rumbling]
7120db [chuckles] Better. Oh! I'll need napkins. I'll simply make them... ah, well, I could... or... No. I've got nothing. How do I make these better? What should I do? Make them... [gasps, snaps fingers] Make them glow! Oh, that's not good enough for Fluttershy. Should I make them fly? Glow, fly, and [chuckles] and fold! Glow, fly, fold into fun shapes, perhaps?
712007 Uh, Discord? Are you okay?
7120db Pinkie Pie! Just the pony I need. [snaps fingers] As the party pony and Fluttershy's close – but not best – friend, I need your advice. I'm hosting a tea party for her, and it has to be perfect. No! It has to be even better than perfect!
712007 Oh, Discord. You're waaaaaay overthinking things. All you have to do is make Fluttershy feel comfortable. It should be pretty easy for you. You know her so well!
712000 [ding!]
7120db And that's why you're the party expert. Thank you, Pinkie Pie. I feel so much better now.
712007 Eh, it's what I do.
712000 [shopping cart wheeling away]
7120db [snaps fingers]
712000 [bits jingle]
712007 [to Cherry Fizzy] Excuse me! Where can I find the glowing, flying, self-folding napkins?
712000 [poof!]
7120db Make Fluttershy feel comfortable, make Fluttershy feel comfortable, comfortable, comfortable... Well, I mean, that shouldn't be a problem.
712000 [whimsical music]
712000 [lava bubbling]
712000 [teapot clanking]
7123dc [sneezes]
712000 [tea bags singing]
7120db Oh, dear. That might be a problem.
712000 [tea bags singing]
7120db Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Maybe Fluttershy would be comfortable having a tea party here.
7123dc [sneezes]
712000 [splash!]
7120db Maybe I just need another set of eyes on this. What do you think?
712000 [poof!]
7123d9 [gasps deeply]
7120db That bad?
7123d9 No, worse! Fluttershy would never be comfortable here! What have you done?!
7120db I was trying to make the tea party different and special like me. But all I did was make it chaotic and weird... like me. What if those ponies at the tea shop and the china shop were right? What if Fluttershy sees how crazy this place is and realizes how different we are? And then doesn't want to be friends anymore?! [hyperventilating]
7123d9 Relax! We can fix this. Time to call in the team.
712000 [door opens]
7123d9 Okay, chief. What's the plan?
7120db What to do, what to do, what to do... Oh!
712000 [bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk!]
7120db Got it! We know Fluttershy, and we know what she likes. First of all, we need to get rid of all the new stuff.
7123d9 You heard him! Strike the new stuff!
712000 [poof!]
712000 [vacuum whirring]
712000 [poof!]
712000 [jar clinking]
712000 [smack!]
712000 [boing]
712000 [poof!]
7123dc Bleh!
7123dd Piñatas hate bats.
712000 [tea bags singing]
712000 [tea bag yelps]
7120db Enjoy your all-expense-paid trip around Equestria!
712000 [poof!]
7120db Well done, everybody, but there's still more work to do.
7123de [grumbling]
7120db We need to make this place more Fluttershy and less, well, me.
712000 [poof!]
7120db One thing I know about my dear friend is that she loves comfy chairs. But not on the ceiling. [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db And I'm almost certain she likes stairs...
712000 [poof!]
7120db ...that lead somewhere.
712000 [poof!]
712000 [stretch, whip!]
7120db And although we've never discussed it, I'm pretty sure Fluttershy likes gravity. [snaps fingers]
712000 [crash!]
7120db Okay, fellas! This is a good start, but stand back. Let me show you how it's done. We just need some of this. [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db And a little of that. [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7123de [sounds of awe]
7120db And a whole lot of those! [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db Phew!
712000 [fan whirring]
7123d9 How boring. I mean, normal.
7120db Thank you!
7123d9 Good job. The window treatments are perfectly unexceptional.
7120db But we're not done yet.
7123d9 You don't mean...
7120db Mm-hmm.
7123df Makeover!
712000 [dance music]
7123d9 Hating it. Hating it. Hating it. Hating... how much I love it!
712000 [scissors snipping]
712000 [whip!]
712000 [whip!]
712000 [bees buzzing]
7120db [screams]
7120db Okay, let's give these conversation cards a whirl. [clears throat, reading] "It is very nice to see you today." "Have you read any good books lately?" "Your garden looks positively lovely."
7123df [cheering]
712000 [poof!]
7120db Huh. Quite strange. For the first time in my life, I don't feel quite strange. In fact, I feel... completely normal. Everything is finally perfect for Fluttershy.
712000 [clock chiming]
7120db And just in time. [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
71200e Discord! I'm so excited to finally see where you live!
7120db G-Greetings, friend. Please do come in.
71200e I can't wait to see how... uh... Oh.
712000 [clock ticking]
7120db Is something amiss?
71200e Um, no, no, not at all. It's just not what I expected. It's quite... lovely.
7120db Please have a seat.
71200e Where is it?
7120db Right here.
71200e Oh.
7120db I think you'll be quite pleased with the green tea I've selected for us today.
71200e Oooh! Does it actually turn us green? Is it really envious of the other teas? What's it do, what's it do?!
7120db Uh, well, it tastes delicious.
71200e Oh... Okay.
7120db What particularly nice weather we're having.
71200e Yes... Yes, we are.
7120db [sips tea] It did rain the other day, however.
71200e Uh-huh...
7120db But the weather today is particularly nice. ...As I previously mentioned. Would you care for some milk toast?
71200e Uh, Discord, you don't seem to be yourself today. Are you feeling all right?
7120db Whatever do you mean?
71200e Well, it's just... what you're wearing. And also what you're saying. And also the way you're saying it. And, um, pretty much everything else.
7120db Oh, dear Fluttershy, worry not. I can assure you that for the first time, I'm feeling perfectly normal. Now, let me top you off.
712000 [clatter!]
7120db Oops! Butterfingers! How embarrassing.
712000 [fizzle]
71200e Uh, what's going on?
7120db I have... no idea.
71200e [gasps] Discord! You're starting to fade away!
7120db Oh, you don't say... Have you read any good books lately? [chuckles nervously]
7120db Huh. Have you tried the scones? They're positively delectable. The secret is in the extra butter.
71200e What is wrong with you?! You're acting so normal, which is not so normal for you!
7120db Well, whatever do you mean? This is just me being me.
71200e No, it's not! It's you being like everypony else!
7120db [gasps]
712000 [clatter]
712000 [fizzle]
71200e Eeeek! The more you do it, the more you fade away! Of course! You're a creature of pure chaos! Being normal is destroying you!
7120db [laughs] How interesting. That reminds me of something I heard at the market today.
712000 [fizzle]
71200e Stop it! Please! You need to go back to being your not-normal normal self! Quick, Discord! Uh, do something chaotic before it's too late! Please!
7120db Do something chaotic? I'll try...
712000 [squeak]
7120db Ohhhh, that's not good...
71200e [whimpers] Then I guess it's up to me. [whimpers] Okay. All right. How about... [whimpering]
712000 [clatter]
71200e Oh, no! I tipped over that cup! That's pretty chaotic, right?
7120db [yawns]
71200e [whimpers] What if I... [chomping, mouth full] Oh, my! Talking with food in my mouth after taking a bite from every sandwich! [gulps] How wacky! Doing anything for ya?
712000 [fizzle]
71200e [whimpers] Okay. Hmm. Maybe I need to start thinking like you. Ohhh... What would Discord do? Well, I guess he'd probably make another version of himself to bounce ideas off of.
712000 [clatter]
71200e But one wouldn't be enough. He'd need more! Way more!
712000 [zipping]
71200e [to her reflections] Hey there, Fluttershys! Any ideas on how to Discord up this tea party? [higher-pitched] Hi, Fluttershy! Thanks for asking! First of all, you gotta redecorate this place. I mean, this is where Discord lives! And you're telling me there aren't any stairs that lead to nowhere? [speaking normally] On it!
712000 [zipping]
712000 [crash]
71200e Better... but it still needs something. Now, that's more like it!
712000 [shimmer]
71200e [gasps] It's working! Okay, what else? Furniture on the ground? So predictable! Let's put them where they don't belong!
712000 [hammering, zip!, hammering]
712000 [shimmer]
71200e And he'd have a chaise lounge that would actually chase you! Because he's funny like that! Bet you can't catch me!
7120db [chuckles lightly, snaps fingers, gasps, laughs loudly]
712000 [chaise lounge panting]
71200e Oh! And Discord would have a special kind of tea! Like a ginseng that could really sing!
7120db I would. I-I would! [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
712000 [tea bags singing]
71200e And he'd serve it on a floating table! We never talked about it, but I'm pretty sure Discord hates gravity!
7120db I do! Who wants to be tethered to the ground when you can do this? [snaps fingers]
71200e [laughs] Now this is exactly what I was hoping for!
7120db This is what you were hoping for? But this is the complete opposite of your tea parties.
71200e I wouldn't expect you to throw a tea party the way I would. We're different!
7120db I know. I was afraid that if you saw exactly how different we are, you wouldn't want to be friends anymore.
71200e What?! Why would you ever think that?
7120db Because you and I don't make sense to anypony else.
71200e That may be true, but we make sense to me. I never would've thought to make singing ginseng before I met you. But you've opened me up to so many more possibilities and impossibilities. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I like you because you're so different from me.
7120db You do?
71200e Of course I do, silly! Besides, what's discord without a little chaos?
7120db [chuckling] Well! In that case, I certainly don't need to be wearing this.
712000 [rip!]
7120db Oops! [laughs] I forgot that I still had this on!
712000 [poof!]
71200e [giggling] Now, about that tea party...
71200e You know, your garden really is looking lovely.
7120db Why, thank you for noticing. I also couldn't help but notice that you need a refill.
712000 [tea pouring]
7123dc [sneezes]
71200e Gesundheit.
7120db It really is nice having you here.
71200e I'm happy to be here. And I really do like your place. Because it's so you.
7120db Why, thank you, Fluttershy.
71200e Now, how about we try some of those delicious-looking sandwiches?
7120db [snaps fingers]
712000 [poof!]
7120db [chuckles] You read my mind!
71200e [giggling]

71300a Hmmm.
713000 [ponies continue chattering]
71300a [gasps] Thank you! You must be new. I'm Apple Bloom.
7133e0 I'm Grand Pear.
71300a Welcome to Ponyville!
7130a4 [scoffs] You mean welcome back to Ponyville. Grand Pear was originally from here before he opened his famous pear jam store in Vanhoover.
71300a Really? Why'd ya move back?
7133e0 I, uh... [smacks lips] Well, I needed a change of pace.
71300a Huh. [chomps] This is delicious! [chomps] I can't believe I've gone my whole life without ever havin' this.
7133e0 Glad you like it.
71300a How much?
7133e0 Nah.
71300a Wow! Thanks, Mr Grand Pear, sir! It was real nice meetin' you!
713000 [ponies continue chattering]
713000 [door opens]
713008 Glad you're back, sugarcube. Just in time for breakfast for dinner.
71300a I got the perfect topper for flapjacks at the market today.
713008 [gasps] Pear jam?! What were you thinkin'?!
713000 [distant door closing]
713008 Quick! Hide it!
713000 [wood breaking]
71300a Huh?
713000 [theme song]
71300a What's the big deal? It's just pear jam.
713008 The big deal is that there is a long-standing feud between the Apples and the Pears!
713026 Eeyup!
71300a Why?
713008 Why?! ...Well, uh, a-actually, I-I'm-I'm not really sure. You have any idea, Big Mac?
713026 Uhhh... nope.
71300a Then I guess we should ask Granny?
713009 Ask me what?
713000 [dirt shuffling]
713000 [thud]
713008 Uh, what goes better with apple fritter flapjacks – caramel syrup or praline!
713009 [blows raspberry] Praline.
713000 [clatter]
713009 [sniffs] Oh-ho-ho, that smells great, Applejack. I'ma go wash up for supper. Be right back.
713000 [door closes]
713135 [sighs]
713008 Listen, sugarcube. Anytime Big Mac and I ever asked Granny about the feud or the Pears, she'd get so upset she couldn't talk. Best not bring it up.
71300a O-Okay, but that Grand Pear was really nice to me, even though I'm an Apple. I wonder what happened.
713008 Me, too. But if we can't ask Granny, I don't know who— We can ask Goldie Delicious! If anypony knows about the feud, it's the family historian!
71300a I'm in! What do you say, Big Mac? Siblin' trip first thing tomorrow?
713026 Eeyup!
713000 [knock, knock]
713000 [cat yowls]
713000 [crash!]
713000 [cats meowing]
713214 Now, that's how you make an entrance! Or is it an exit? [laughs] Well, anyway, it's so wonderful to see you three. To what do I owe the pleasure?
713008 Well, Goldie, we were hopin' you could tell us about the, uh... feud with the Apples and the Pears.
713214 Oh. Oh, dear. Well, does Granny Smith know you're here?
71300a No, ma'am. But I ran into Grand Pear yesterday, and he was real nice. Maybe the feud was a misunderstandin' or somethin', and we can fix it?
713214 Oh, well, I don't know about that, little one. But if it's a story you're after, I suppose you have a right to know. Now, let's see, I got a stack of books here someplace... Oh! Apple Family History, Volume 137! Hmm, hmm... Here we are. "Feud with the Bears". I mean, "Pears". My eyes ain't what they used to be. A long time ago, Sweet Apple Acres wasn't the only farm in Ponyville. In fact, there was another one just right next door.
7131dd Come and get your apples! Nothin' sweeter than bitin' into a crisp apple on a beautiful fall day!
7133e1 Unless, of course...
713000 [ponies gasp]
7133e1 ...you could bite into a juicy pear.
7131dd [scoffs] Please. Pears are just what happens when you ain't no good at farmin' apples.
7133e1 Pears are nature's candy. Apples are sour. Like the expression on your face right now. [chuckles impishly]
713214 [voiceover] And so it went. Granny and Grand Pear were always at each other on who was the best farmer or who took better care of their trees. If Granny read to her trees at night...
7131dd [reading] "And then, the little tree reached his branches up to the moon, and the moon said, 'Good night.'"
713214 [voiceover] ...why, then Grand Pear had special blankets made for his trees so they wouldn't get cold.
7133e1 Good night, trees. [kisses] I've got you covered. Mm-hmm.
7131dd [growls]
713000 [book thuds]
713000 [Apple family ponies grunting]
713214 [voiceover] In fact, all the Apples and the Pears were rivals to the core! The only Apple and Pear who ever got along were Bright Macintosh and Pear Butter.
7133e2 [whispering] Pssst! I'm not supposed to talk to you.
7133e3 [whispering] I'm not supposed to talk to you either.
7133e2 [whispering] My mom says if you hold a buttercup under your chin, it'll make your chin glow. But it doesn't work on me. See?
7133e3 [whispering] Does it work on me?
713000 [heart beating]
7133e2 It sure does, Buttercup.
7133e3 Buttercup. I like that name.
713008 [voiceover] Wait an apple-pickin' minute!
713008 Bright Mac and Buttercup? Those are our parents' names!
713214 Of course Buttercup was just a nickname your father gave your mother. Pear Butter – well, that was her given name.
713008 Are you sayin' our mother was a... Pear?!
7132ea [deep gasp]
713026 So we are half-Pear?!
713008 I can't believe it! How did we not know?!
713214 Well, uh, nopony called your mother Pear Butter.
713000 [cats meowing]
713214 And her cutie mark was a preserve jar, but pear butter don't look too much different from apple butter, so no clues there.
713008 [sighs] Is there a-anythin' else you can tell us about them?
713214 I know they loved each other very much. They had that magical, star-kissed, other-side-of-a-rainbow kind of love. You couldn't be around them too long and, and not feel a little bit lighter than air yourself. [chuckling]
71300a Anything else?
713214 Hmm... I'd need Volume 138 for that.
713000 [cheetah grunts]
713214 I'm sure I could wrangle it... in a, in a couple of days.
713008 [sighs] That's all right, Goldie. It was... nice just to hear—
713214 Ooh-hoo-hoo! I just remembered somethin'! Your dad and his buddy Burnt Oak would get in all kinds of trouble together as colts.
713008 Burnt Oak? The firewood salespony? I haven't seen him in ages.
713214 He and your dad were thick as thieves back in the day. Y'all should talk to him.
713000 [thud]
713000 [cheetah grunts]
7133e4 Well, well, if it isn't the Apples. What can I do for ya? I know you're not here for firewood. You got more trees than anypony in Ponyville.
713008 You're right. We're not here for that.
7133e4 Come to ask about your dad?
713026 Uh, eeyup.
7133e4 I wondered if you might. Hoped you would. It's nice to talk about him. [laughs] We had a lot of laughs. In fact, this one time...
7133e4 [voiceover] ...we were racin' to see who could till the fastest, and Bright Mac was leavin' me in the dust. He would've won, too, if he wasn't so... distracted.
7133e5 Whoa!
713000 [crash]
713000 [splash]
7133e6 [spits]
7133e0 Oh!
713000 [splash]
7133e0 Pear Butter, what did you do?!
7133e6 I-I'm not sure.
7133e5 She didn't do it, sir.
7133e0 Excuse me?
7133e5 The water silo. It was my fault.
7133e6 [giggles]
7133e0 [snorts] You owe me a new silo, boy! [to Pear Butter] And you, come with me. No daughter of mine is gonna make goo-goo eyes at an Apple!
7133e4 Grand Pear never would've known it was your father's fault. But there was no way he'd let your mother take the blame for somethin' he did.
71300a So Dad was super honest! Apple doesn't fall far from the tree, huh, Applejack?
713000 [thunk]
7133e4 Your dad worked the Apple farm all day and then headed over to the Pears on his breaks to fix the water silo. I didn't see him for weeks! Not that he minded. Gave him a chance to get to know your mom.
71300a Did you know our mom, too?
7133e4 Buttercup was a real peach of a Pear. But if you want to know more about her, you should ask Mrs Cake.
71300a Mrs Cake?
7133e4 She and your mom were inseparable when they were fillies.
713008 Then let's go! Thanks, Burnt Oak!
713026 Uh, would it be okay if we stopped by again sometime to hear more stories?
7133e4 I'd like that very much.
713000 [the Cakes' theme playing]
713000 [door opens]
71302a Well, cinnamon sugar on toast! All three Apple siblings!
713008 Hi, Mrs Cake. We heard you and our ma used to be real good friends, and we were hopin' you could tell us a bit about her.
71302a Oh, I would love to. I never knew the right time to bring it up. But I'm so glad you came! [laughs] Uh, for starters, did you all know that it was your mom who convinced me to pursue baking?
71300a But isn't your name Mrs Cake?
71302a Not always. Back when I was Chiffon Swirl, heh, I had no idea what I was supposed to do. But one day, your mom brought me some candied pears, eggs, flour, sugar, and vanilla, and told me to just be creative! Next thing I knew, I was whipping up pear upside-down cake, and I got my cutie mark! It was like she knew what I was supposed to do long before I did.
713008 [to Apple Bloom] Just like you, sugarcube! Or rather, you're just like her!
71302a That was the first of many cakes for me, and Buttercup was with me through it all.
71302a [voiceover] She'd be my taste-tester, help with the decorating, and prep new ingredients. Over the years, I perfected my recipes. Your mom did so much for me. One day, I wanted to surprise her with a cake.
7133e7 [laughing]
7133e5 [sniffs] Achoo!
7133e6 [blows, giggles]
7133e7 [laughing]
713000 [twig snaps]
7133e6 [gasps] Oh. It's just you.
7133e8 Sorry. I just brought you a little something to say thank you. But I see you're busy. Hah.
7133e6 [giggles] Promise you won't say anything?
713000 [bush rustles]
713009 [whinny, snort] What in tarnation are you doin', Bright Mac?! We do not fraternize with Pears! [spits]
7133e8 You and Bright Mac? Whew, I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. Your families hate each other.
7133e6 I can't help it. We just sorta... happened.
71302a [voiceover] Then Pear Butter told me the sweetest love story I have ever heard.
7133e5 Happy one hundred and thirty-one thousand, four hundred and fifty-six hour anniversary, darlin'.
7133e6 What? [laughs] That's way longer than we've been together.
7133e5 I know, but it's the anniversary of the first time I called you "Buttercup". It's okay if you didn't get me anythin'.
7133e6 Actually... I did.
7133e5 A guitar? For me? But... [strums guitar] I don't know how to play.
7133e6 Quiet, you.
7133e6 [Pear Butter]
7133e6 We're far apart in every way
7133e6 But you're the best part of my day
7133e6 And sure as I breathe the air
7133e6 I know we are the perfect pair
7133e6 On a prickly path that goes on for miles
7133e6 But it's worth it just to see you smile
7133e6 And I cannot be pulled apart
7133e6 From the hold you have on my heart
7133e6 And even if the world tells us it's wrong
7133e6 You're in my head like a catchy song
7133e5 Wow. It's just... wow.
7133e6 Do you like it? Be honest now.
7133e5 It's the best gift you could've given me!
7133e6 [Pear Butter]
7133e6 The seasons change and leaves may fall
7133e6 But I'll be with you through them all
7133e6 And rain or shine, you'll always be mine
7133e6 On a prickly path that goes on for miles
7133e6 You're the only one who makes it all worthwhile
7133e6 And you should not blame me, too
7133e6 If I can't help fallin' in love with you...
7133e5 Hey, no fair. I was gonna tell you the same thing.
7133e6 You're just mad I beat you to it.
7133e5 I'm tellin' ya, I was gonna pull you up, cover your eyes, lead you over here... and say, "Surprise!" And then you'd say, [imitating Pear Butter] "Oh, Bright Mac, I love it!" [speaking normally] And then I'd say I love you. Too bad it didn't work out though.
7133e6 Eeyup. Too bad.
713000 [paper ripping]
7133e0 The Pears are moving!
7133e6 [deep gasp]
713135 [deep gasp]
713008 I mean, I figured the Pears moved, but I didn't know all that stuff happened before with Granny and Grand Pear.
71300a It must've been really hard on our parents.
71302a Oh, it was.
7133e6 We're moving?! To Vanhoover?! But that's so far!
7133e0 It's what's best. There's acres of untouched land and a warehouse to make our jams. We'll get to expand our business and get away from those gosh-darned Apples.
71302a [voiceover] Pear Butter was devastated. But seeing no way out of it, she did what she had to do.
7133e5 So that's it?
7133e6 What do you want me to do, Bright Mac? We're movin'. I love you, but [tearing up] I have to stay with my family.
71302a [voiceover] Then Bright Mac did the most romantic thing I've ever seen anypony do.
71300a What?! What?!
713008 [simultaneous] What?! What did he do?!
713026 [simultaneous] Tell us! Tell us!
71302a We're gonna need one more pony to tell that story.
71300a Mayor Mare, you knew our parents?
713010 Not as well as Mrs Cake, but I did play a part in their love story. The night before the Pear family moved, Bright Mac asked me to meet him at the edge of Sweet Apple Acres.
7133e6 [gasps]
7133e5 I don't want to be apart from you. Ever. I'm not sure what we'll do, but I'm sure of us. So sure that I'd marry you today.
7133e6 I would, too!
7133e9 I think that's my cue.
713010 [voiceover] I had the honor of officiating your parents' secret wedding, and it was perfect. Bright Mac knew Buttercup wouldn't want a big splash.
71300a [voiceover] Reminds me of somepony else I know.
713026 [voiceover, chuckling] Eeyup.
713010 [voiceover] So they had a special way to seal their vows.
7133e9 I now pronounce you—
713009 What is goin' on?! What's with all these here candles?!
7133e0 Pear Butter! Where are ya? You're supposed to be packing! [grimly] What are you two doing?
7133e5 Ma, Grand Pear, Buttercup and I are in love!
7133ea What?!
7133e6 And we'll be married as soon as Mayor Mare says...
7133e9 Oh! [quickly] I now pronounce you husband and wife!
7133e6 Doesn't that feel nice? [kisses]
7133e7 [kissing]
713009 What are you talking about, married?! You two can't be married!
7133e0 Finally, something we can agree on. Pear Butter, enough of this nonsense. We're movin'! And you gotta stick with your family!
7133e6 But... the Apples are my family now, too.
7133e0 You can't be serious. Are you choosin' to be an Apple over being a Pear?!
7133e6 Are you makin' me choose?
7133e0 Yes. I am.
7133e6 Then yeah. I guess I am.
7133e0 Fine!
7133e6 [sobbing]
713008 I can't believe Grand Pear just up and left Ma like that! No wonder Granny never told us about any of this.
71302a These things are never easy.
713010 And it's hard to know when it is a good time.
713008 It seems to me that now's as good a time as any.
71300a To talk to both our grandparents.
71300a Excuse me? Grand Pear?
713008 I'm Applejack, and this here's Big McIntosh. But you already know who we are, don't ya?
7133e0 Sure do.
71300a Did you really move to Ponyville just for a change of pace?
7133e0 No.
71300a Then you came here because you're sorry and that you wanted to get to know us, too?
7133e0 I'm... so sorry. I-I-I was just so angry, and... well, I-I never...
71300a It's in the past, Grand Pear. Oh! Can I call you Grandpere Pear?
7133e0 [chuckles] Sure can.
713009 Now where'd you all get to? I ain't seen hide or hair of ya's all day.
713008 We've been all over. Learnin' about our parents.
713009 Guh... Y-You have?
713008 And our grandfather.
713009 So... you're back, huh?
7133e0 Sure am. [mumbling] Never should've left.
71300a Findin' you and learnin' all about Mom and Dad, I feel like I found a piece of me I didn't even know was missin'.
713008 Hearin' their story makes me feel closer to them somehow.
713009 I'm sorry. I should've told you all about 'em sooner.
7133e0 And I should've been here. Ah, I can't believe I let a silly feud keep me from my family.
713008 Nothing's keepin' ya from us now. Let's not miss anythin' else.
713009 Applejack's right. Welcome back, prickly old pear. Heh.
7133e0 [chuckles] Thanks, you old crabapple.
71300a Now that we're all together, there's somethin' we want to show you. Mom and Dad left us somethin' to remember them by. Come on!
713000 [bushes rustling]
7133e0 Whoa.
713009 [sounds of awe] It's beautiful.
7133e0 It's... impossible.
713008 If anything's gonna make it through, it's apples and pears.
7133e0 [chuckles]
713000 ["You're In My Head Like a Catchy Song" instrumental plays over credits]
714000 [foals laughing]
714000 [splat]
7143eb Oops! Sorry, Princess Twilight. That was meant for her. Incoming!
714003 Whoa!
714000 [clink]
714000 [splat]
714003 Toola Roola, Coconut Cream, what are you doing?!
7143ec That was meant for my ex-friend.
7143eb I'm not your ex-friend – you're my ex-friend!
714000 [multiple splats]
714003 Both of you, stop!
714003 ...So you see, friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for.
7143ed Awww! [laughing]
714003 Hmmm. That sounds familiar. [gasps]
714003 [humming and hmm-ing] No... Aha! Here it is.
71427c What is that?
714003 Come on, Starlight, don't judge a book by its cover. This is the friendship journal my friends and I used to keep. It's filled with all the things we've learned, like - "Friendship isn't always easy, but there's no doubt, it's worth fighting for."
714000 [paper rustling]
71427c I'll judge a book by its cover just this once.
714003 [grumbles]
714000 [theme song]
714003 Thanks for coming, everypony. I've got a surprise for you.
71400e What is it, Twilight? Do I need to prepare myself?
714003 It's this!
714000 [magic zap]
71400d Ugh, what is that thing? Why is it so smelly?
714007 Wait a minute. [gasps] Is this our old friendship journal? I haven't seen this thing in forever!
714008 Hoo-wee! It's lookin' a little, uh... overripe.
71400c I'll say!
714000 [pages turning]
71400c There's a smushed apple in Applejack's lessons.
714000 [page turns]
71400c Fluttershy's lessons are so small, you can barely read them.
71400e I, uh, wanted to leave room for all of you.
714000 [pages turning]
71400c I-I don't even know what this is.
71400d It is called calligraphy, darling. If you're going to make words, at least make them fabulous.
714000 [page unfolding]
714008 Looks like you got a little aggressive with your friendship lessons, Rainbow Dash.
71400c What can I say? When I learn something, I learn it hard.
714000 [confetti explodes]
71400c [unimpressed] I found Pinkie's page.
714007 [giggles] Well, I am surprised!
714003 That wasn't the only surprise.
714000 [magic zap]
714000 [pages rustling]
714003 Ta-da! Starlight and I decided to make one for each of you!
714008 That's amazin'! A perfect copy!
71427c I learned the spell years ago when I needed to make copies of a certain— [long pause] [clears throat] ...manifesto.
71400d [sniffs] Ahhh! Even better than a perfect copy.
71400e Oh, I'd forgotten all about this lesson.
71400c [laughing] Remember this one from when I helped Daring Do? "Never underestimate the power of friends who always got your back."
714007 Aww, Cheese Sandwich! Party cannon! Ah! Birth-iversary!
71427c After Twilight remembered the journal, I had so much fun reading all the stuff you've all learned, I just had to have my own copy.
714003 And that brings me to the second part of the surprise. My idea. How would you girls feel about making our journal available for everypony? If we can get these lessons into other ponies' hooves, maybe they'll benefit from them.
71400e Well, I think that's a great idea.
714007 I'm in! Yay!
714008 W-We always said we wanted to.
71400d Sounds fabulous.
71400c [laughing] I'm awesome.
714000 [pause]
71400c Oh, yeah. Uh, good idea.
714000 [montage music]
714000 [foals chattering]
7143eb No! I don't wanna play with you anymore!
7143ec Why not?! You love playing hopskotch!
7143eb No, you do because you always win!
714003 Hey, girls. Couldn't help but overhear. You might want to take a breather, maybe read Rainbow Dash's chapter on Rainbow Falls? It might help.
7143eb Sure, Princess.
71400a Thanks, Twilight! The friendship journal's makin' us super popular!
714003 Oh.
71400a We were thinkin' of puttin' together a cutie mark summer camp. Now, everypony's definitely gonna sign up for it! This is gonna be awesome! [laughs] Cutie Mark Crusaders, whoo.
71427c A cutie mark camp is a great idea.
714003 Yeah, but the purpose of the journal isn't supposed to be marketing.
714003 I just hope those foals actually learn something from our lessons.
71427c They will! I'm sure ponies all across Equestria will— Whoa!
714003 Uh, hello! Can I... help you?
7143ee We're here all the way from Fillydelphia because we got copies of your friendship journal!
714003 Wow! How wonderful! What was your favorite friendship—
7143ee Will you sign them?!
714003 Oh, uh, I guess so. So, what did you think of the lessons?
7143ee Oh, we haven't read them. These are keepsakes. We gotta keep them in mint condition. Ha-ha.
714003 Oh.
7143ef Wow, that was worth the trip!
714000 [visiting ponies chattering excitedly]
714003 [sighs]
71427c Don't worry, Twilight. I'm sure lots of other ponies are being inspired to be better friends.
7142d7 Well, I for one found the journal terribly illuminating.
714003 [gasps]
7143f0 I agree. I'm seeing sides of these ponies I didn't know were there. I only wish they'd left Rarity out. She clearly doesn't belong in that book with the rest of them.
7142d7 Oh, I know! Who does she think she is? Certainly she did a fine job setting up the Ponyville Days celebration, but does she really believe it was a success just because of her? [inconsiderate laughter] The nerve!
714000 [paper rustling]
71400d [bawling]
714003 But that's not what she was saying! Rarity!
71400d [crying]
714003 Oh, poor Rarity. She overheard all the mean things those ponies were saying. She must be devastated. I'm going after her.
71427c Go ahead. I'm gonna have a chat with these two.
71400d [crying]
714003 Rarity, wait!
714000 [smack]
714007 Twilight! Isn't it amazing? Our journals are everywhere!
714003 Pinkie, I've got to—
714007 Ponies keep stopping by to tell me my entries are hilarious!
714000 [scribbling]
714007 I even had somepony come all the way from Las Pegasus to say how much he liked my lessons!
714003 I am so glad to hear some ponies are being inspired by the journal.
7140a7 Hey, look! There's Pinkie Pie! The funny one!
714000 [ponies laughing]
714007 Giggly feedback is the best kind!
714000 [ponies laughing]
714003 Well, at least you're getting a positive reaction. I just saw Rarity, and I'm afraid this whole journal thing really upset her.
714007 Aww, that's too bad.
714000 [ponies laughing]
714007 Wait. That wasn't even funny.
714000 [ponies laughing]
714003 O-kay. Well, I guess I'll catch you later.
714000 [beat]
7140a7 [coughs]
714003 [groans]
714007 Yup. Bye, Twilight!
714000 [ponies laughing]
7140f9 Hah! Classic Pinkie! Oh, she's even funnier in real life!
714007 You've known me for years!
714000 [ponies laughing]
714000 [pages rustling]
71400c Maybe it's time to call it a day.
714277 I wipped out all the Twilight Spawkle lessons 'cause they were getting in the way of the good ones.
714003 What do you mean you skipped the lessons? We've all had valuable experiences.
71400c Hey, here's a great idea! Why don't you guys talk to Twilight for a while? So I can get back to things like working and napping and, well, pretty much anything else.
714277 Aw, we don't wanna hear her bowing lessons! Come on! Tell us again about when you met Dawing Do!
71400c [laughs nervously] Again? Haven't we already covered that one? A couple dozen times?
714277 We can't get enough of it! Come on, you don't want to disappoint your fans!
71400c Uh... It's just that I, uh, really need to get those storm clouds back in their... pens.
714277 Oh, cool! We'll come along. You can tell us the stowy there.
7143f1 Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash! Rainbow Dash!
714000 [ponies chattering]
714003 Oh, what's going on now?
71400e Please, just leave me alone!
714003 Fluttershy, what's wrong?
7143f2 We want answers!
7143f3 Yeah! We're entitled to know!
714003 What is it, everypony?
7143f3 We wanna know why Fluttershy keeps learning the same thing over and over again! Be assertive already!
714111 Even I've learned more than she has! Why can't I be in the book?!
71427c What? Really?! Are you attacking my friend because you want to be in a book?!
71400e It's okay. I got this, girls. [inhales] Listen up! I am more assertive! And yes, it took me a while to get there. But can you honestly say that you could learn something one time and completely change who you are? [beat] I didn't think so.
7143f2 Wow. You're way different from the Fluttershy in the book. I don't know how I feel about that.
71400e [sighs]
714000 [ponies chattering]
714003 It feels like everypony in Equestria is missing the "friendship" part of the friendship journals.
714000 [door opens]
714003 Rarity, are you alright? [yelps]
714000 [smash]
714000 [sewing machine whirr]
714003 What are you doing?
71400d Why, I'm creating a gown, darling!
714003 For what?
71400d I don't know! I'm stress-sewing! [frustrated noises]
714003 Stress-sewing?
71400d When I overheard those two at the cafe, I suddenly understood why I've been getting cancellations for days!
71427c What? Why are ponies cancelling their orders?
714000 [squeak]
71400d Because nopony likes me any more! They're boycotting me! [grunts]
714000 [ponies chattering]
714003 I'm sure if I go out there and talk to those ponies, they'll see that they're being unreasonable.
714000 [door opens]
714003 [yelps]
714008 [panting] I need a hundred blankets, and I need 'em now! Sorry, Twilight.
71400d Right away, pony-who-still-likes-me!
714008 I don't need nothin' fancy.
714003 What's the matter, Applejack?
714008 I'm popular, Twilight! I'm popular, and I don't like it one bit!
71427c You go ahead. I'll stay here.
714003 [inhales and exhales]
714000 [sewing machine whirr]
714000 [loud pony chattering]
714000 [squeaking]
71400a [frustrated groan]
714003 Applejack, who are all these ponies?
714008 They call themselves the Sweet Apple Admirers. They say they read my journal entries, and they felt like a part of the family. And now they actually wanna become part of the family!
714000 [camera flashes]
714003 Your journal entries?
714008 Yeah, you know, all the stuff about how friends are like family and whatnot?
714003 Can't you get rid of them?
714008 And kick out my own family?! Granny Smith, hang on! Let me help!
7143f4 There she is!
71400f Yee-haw!
714003 [sighs] I wish we'd never released that journal.
71427c There you are! Okay, I just left Rarity. I think she's doing better, and— Oh, boy. Window-staring, huh? Was it that bad at Sweet Apple Acres?
714003 It's bad everywhere. I thought I was doing something good. I thought I was helping. How could our friendship journal have led to so much... anti-friendship?!
71427c Oh, Twilight, it's not your fault.
714003 Of course it's my fault! If I hadn't had the big idea to make copies, none of this would be happening! I'm afraid I made life awful for my friends!
71427c I really think you're being too hard on yourself.
714003 Am I?!
714000 [knocking]
714000 [door opens]
714003 [yelps]
714000 [loud chattering]
714000 [doors slam]
714000 [crunch]
714003 [sighs]
714008 I didn't know where else to go! I've got so much cookin' and cleanin' and family-in' to do... I ain't got time for anythin' else!
714007 At least ponies aren't laughing every time you talk! Not even I want to be funny all the time! I'm telling you, my days of hilariosity-ness-ness are over!
71400c You think you've got problems? I know I'm awesome, but I can't even go to the bathroom without somepony trying to tell me how cool I am! [beat] Uh, Rarity? What are you wearing?
71400d My emotions, darling! Stress couture!
71400e I don't know what I'm gonna do if I have to defend myself one more time!
71400d Hmm? Oh, uh, sorry, darling. Force of habit.
714000 [curtain drawing]
714000 [loud muffled chatter]
714008 [snoring]
714000 [pop]
714000 [crunch]
71427c Okay, so maybe they are having a hard time with it. That doesn't mean you did anything wrong.
714003 Yes, I did! Releasing the journal was my idea, and it backfired in ways I could never have imagined!
71427c It's not your fault. It's everypony else's! They're just focusing on the wrong things, and— [gasps] Wait here! I've got an idea!
714000 [magic zap]
714003 I can't wait any longer. I've got to fix this.
714000 [ponies arguing loudly]
714000 [doors open]
714003 Everypony, please stop!
714000 [ponies arguing loudly]
7143f5 Princess Twilight, I'm with the Canterlot Chronicle. Quick question — what would you say to ponies who wonder why you moved to Ponyville in the first place?
714003 I moved here to learn about friendship. That's why the journal even exists. It took some time for me to get the hang of it, but it was each of these ponies standing next to me who taught me the lessons in those journals. Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, too. Then it was all of you. I've learned so much from—
7143f5 What I mean is, some ponies would argue that it doesn't seem believable that the six of you would be friends.
714003 "Believable"?
7143f5 Well, sure. I read this journal cover to cover, and I have to say your character would have been much more interesting if she'd stayed in Canterlot.
714003 My character?! We are real ponies! This journal is a record of things that actually happened to us! We made mistakes, and we learned from them!
7142d7 What about Rarity? Are we really supposed to believe she learned anything she wrote in there?
714277 That's why you wanna be Team Dash! She's the only one that didn't weally need to learn anything, because she was alweady so cool.
7142e7 Twilight was better before she got wings!
7143f3 Fluttershy is just so painfully shy, it's hard to relate! I mean, come on!
714000 [angry chattering]
714003 Wait a minute, everypony!
714059 Are Pinkie Pie and Applejack related or what?!
714000 [more angry chattering]
714003 Listen to me! [amplified] Listen to me!
714003 [Twilight Sparkle]
714003 I never claimed to be perfect
714003 My mistakes are all written in ink
714003 None of us claimed to be perfect
714003 And it's sad if that's what you all think
714003 Our flaws helped to make us special
714003 They bond us and keep us strong
714003 Our flaws are what brought us together
714003 So stop actin' like somethin's wrong
714012 [Mane Six]
714012 We're not flawless
714012 We're a work in progress
714012 We've got dents and we've got quirks
714012 But it's our flaws that make us work
714012 Yeah, we're not flawless
714012 We're a work in progress
714012 So tell me what flaws you got, too
714012 'Cause I still like what's flawed about you
71400c [Rainbow Dash]
71400c They say I'm a big shot
71400c That my ego's the size of a whale
71400c My confidence comes off as cocky
71400c But it gives me the courage to fail
71400d [Rarity]
71400d Sure, I can be a drama queen
71400d A bit stuck-up, it's true
714008 [Applejack]
714008 And I can be too eager to please
714008 There's such thing as bein' too honest, too, 'cause
714012 [Mane Six]
714012 We're not flawless
714012 We're a work in progress
714012 We've got dents and we've got quirks
714012 But it's our flaws that make us work
714012 Yeah, we're not flawless
714012 We're a work in progress
714012 So tell me what flaws you got, too
714012 'Cause I still like what's flawed about you
714007 [Pinkie Pie]
714007 Ponies think I'm all bubbles and laughter
714007 That I don't seem sincere
714007 I might joke around a little too much
714007 But I'm just so happy you're here
71400e [Fluttershy]
71400e It took me a while to be confident
71400e To really come out of my shell
714003 [Twilight Sparkle]
714003 But nopony has to be perfect
714003 By now, don't you know us so well? Because, yeah
714012 [Mane Six]
714012 We're not flawless
714012 We're a work in progress
714012 We've got dents and we've got quirks
714012 But it's our flaws that make us work
714012 Yeah, we're not flawless
714012 We're a work in progress
714012 So tell me what flaws you got, too
714007 (You got, too)
714007 'Cause I still like what's flawed about you
714003 So you see, everypony? None of us ever claimed to be perfect. Without our flaws, there wouldn't be any friendship lessons to learn. Without our flaws... there probably wouldn't be any friendships at all.
714000 [beat]
714000 [angry chattering]
714000 [door opens]
714000 [door closes]
714012 [sighs in unison]
71400c So that just happened.
71427c Girls! I found two ponies who have something I think you should hear.
7143eb Um, we just wanted to say thank you. To all of you.
7143ec Yeah, our friendship? Well, we were having trouble until we read your journal. It showed us that friends can go through all sorts of tough times and come through stronger than before.
7143eb It's made us better friends than we've ever been!
714003 Really?
7143ed Mm-hmm.
714003 Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to hear that. Thank you for telling us. We've had a tough couple of days, but knowing we've helped fillies like you...
714008 It makes everythin' we've been through worth it.
71400d Absolutely. Fads come and go. Friendship is forever.
71400c There are worse things than not being able to do anything without being told I'm awesome.
71400e And we can't change the way other ponies think about us. But we can change how we let it affect us.
714007 Or how we don't let it affect us!
714000 [splat]
714000 [clang]
714007 [giggles] Go ahead! Laugh!
714213 [laughing]
714008 Reckon we still have to deal with them, don't we?
714000 [loud arguing]
714003 Stay in the friendship moment, Applejack. They can wait a little longer.
714000 [credits]
715000 [cheerful music]
715005 Is the banner even? Are the flowers in place? By which I mean "completely out of view". I'm pretty sure dragons don't like flowers. And what about the Ceremonial Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship? Is it still flaming?
715000 [flame bursts]
715003 Spike, everything looks great! You're getting yourself worked up for no reason.
715005 I have lots of reasons. In fact, I wrote them down.
71527c [sighs] You've been hanging around Twilight for too long.
715003 [chuckles nervously]
715005 Reason number one – I invited Dragon Lord Ember to Ponyville today. Reason two – the Dragon Lord is a dragon. Reason three – she's coming here to learn more about friendship.
715003 According to Ember's letters, the dragons are trying to be friends, but competing is in their nature, and it's leading to more and more fights.
715005 Which brings me to to reason number four. The Dragon Lord wants my advice, and as the new official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I can't let her down.
715003 I know you feel a lot of pressure, but you've got this, Spike!
715005 I... I just want things to be perfect.
715000 [tap, tap]
715005 [gasps] Thorax! You're in Ponyville!
715361 Of course I am, silly! You invited me. And I'm not one to back out of an invitation. Hey, Twilight! Hey, Starlight!
715003 Twilight Sparkle:
715000 [nervously] Hey!
71527c Starlight Glimmer:
715000 [nervously] Hello!
715361 Oooh! I can't believe you did all this for me! Great banner! Love the stage! What's this flame thingy? Oh, it's pretty!
715003 [whispering, to Spike] You invited Thorax over to Ponyville on the same day as Ember?!
715005 Apparently.
71527c That doesn't seem like a good idea. How are you gonna entertain them both?
715005 I have no idea. [whimpers]
715000 [theme song]
715005 I completely forgot! Thorax wrote and said he needed to talk, and I told him to come over. I didn't realize it was the same day I invited Ember! What am I gonna do?! [teeth chattering]
71527c Well, maybe they'll like each other.
715005 Probably not. Ember is tough and self-assured and intimidating. And Thorax is...
715361 Spike, I'm so glad you invited me! You are one of my closest, nicest, most caring, most understanding friends ever! Ooh! Is that ice in the shape of a dragon?
715000 [warbles]
71527c Yeah, I see your point. They might not get each other.
715005 Or worse – they'll hate each other! And if the leader of the changelings and the Dragon Lord get into a fight... [gulps] I could be responsible for starting a war that could ruin Equestria as we know it! [gasps]
715000 [battle music]
715000 [explosion]
715005 [hyperventilates]
715003 I'm sure that won't happen. Now pull it together.
715005 So, heh, Thorax, heh, everything good with you?
715361 Well, honestly, no. Not really. I have indigestion. Not sure if it's the new diet or stress. Or maybe it's both.
715005 No!
715361 Yeah, it really could be both. And it might be affecting my sleeping, too. I'm a real tosser and turner.
715003 Uh-oh! [whimpers]
715005 Sounds like you really need to unwind. Uh, how about a, uh... a trip to the castle? Heh. You can't miss that view.
715003 Yes, the castle! I'll give you a personal tour!
715361 Uh, aren't you coming?
715005 Yeah, I'm just gonna... grab some ice cream for us and catch up. Heh-heh.
715000 [whip]
715000 [whoosh]
715000 [boom]
715000 [fanfare plays]
715005 Dragon Lord Ember, as the official Equestrian friendship ambassador for the Dragon Lands and for Ponyville, I, Spike of Ponyville, welcome you to... uh, Ponyville. [quietly, to himself] I gotta work on my official speech.
7153f6 Okay, thanks. [chuckles] Right. The hug thing.
715005 [chuckles]
7153f6 This place has a lot of colors. In the Dragon Lands, everything's just rocks or the color of ash. [sneezes]
715000 [ponies gasp]
7153f6 That's probably why.
715000 [ponies screaming]
7153f6 Hey, Twilight!
71527c Actually, I'm Starlight. Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you.
7153f6 Oh, sorry. I'm really gonna have to get used to these pony names. Lots of "-lights" and shiny things. So, where is Twilight?
715005 She's in her castle. D'oh!
7153f6 We should go visit her then. Part of friendship is saying "hi" to your friends, right?
715005 Uh, well, yeah, but... [nervous stammering]
7153f6 You're making weird noises. Do you have a stomachache?
715005 Dah. I think I feel one coming on.
7153f6 Well, you know what us dragons say. "Push past the pain!" Now, let's go.
715005 Or we could stay here.
7153f6 Or I could go without you.
71527c [laughs] Ah, I like her.
715005 Ohhh.
715000 [door opens]
715005 Good. They're not here.
7153f6 What was that?
715005 Uh, I... I said, "It's all clean in here!" Uh, you must be hungry from your travels. Please, I'd love to present you with an official friendship welcome banquet.
7153f6 [crunching loudly] So this is something friends do? I could get used to this. [resumes chomping]
71527c Actually, that's not food.
715005 [aside] Dragons love gems!
71527c Fine, but you're telling Twilight what happened to her wall.
7153f6 [continues chomping]
715005 Just keep her here. [to Ember] Okay, yeah! [laughs] Enjoy all the, uh... crystal... things!
7153f6 Where are you going? I thought this was an official friendship banquet.
715005 Just gotta use the little dragons' room!
7153f6 [chomps]
715003 So this is my comfy chair for fictional reads. [grunts] This is my studying chair because the hard back keeps me awake.
715000 [door opens]
715361 Oh, Spike! I'm so glad you're here! [quietly] This castle visit is getting weird. Twilight really likes chairs. Oh, what happened to the ice cream?
715005 What? Oh, right! Uh, they ran out. Heh. Hey, I'm really sorry, but I gotta borrow Twilight quickly.
715003 Aah!
715000 [thud]
715005 Be right back!
715361 But we didn't get to talk yet! [groans]
715005 Ember's here!
715003 I know. I saw you coming and had to distract Thorax by showing him chairs. Why did you bring Ember to the castle of all places?
715005 I don't know! Ember was asking for you, Thorax wants to talk with me. We need to switch places! They might be getting suspicious.
715003 All we have to do is make both Thorax and Ember feel special and keep them apart for a few more hours. We can do this.
715000 [shimmering sounds]
715005 Dah! What's happening?! [whimpers]
715003 I think it's the map. It's calling... you. Apparently, you also have to solve a friendship problem!
715000 [dramatic sting]
715005 The map is calling me?!
715003 Oh, amazing! The map is really reaching out!
715000 [beat]
715003 Not a good time? I get it.
715000 [door opens]
71527c Spike, are you here? Ember's eaten all of Twilight's decorations, and—oh! Hey, Twilight! [chuckles, gasps] Glowing map... [gulps] Glowing spikes... That's not good.
715005 I know!
71527c At least your friendship problem is in Ponyville? Heh.
715005 Okay, okay. To pull this off, I'm gonna need both of you to help. You two need to keep Ember and Thorax separate while I get ice cream.
715003 You mean "find the friendship problem".
715005 Yeeeees! Go easy on me. I'm under a lot of pressure.
715005 Friendship problem? Anypony gotta friendship problem here? Any problems to solve? Friendship problems? Friendship problems! Anypony got a friendship problem here? No? Okay.
71519a [grunts] Well, I think vanilla strawberry cream is overused!
715027 Hmph.
715005 Yes! Fighting! Uh, I mean, what seems to be the problem?
7153f6 Mmm. Mmm. I'm stuffed. [belches]
715003 Ember, there you are!
7153f6 Okay, right. More pony hugs.
715003 How's your trip to Ponyville so far?
7153f6 Well, I'm certainly learning a lot about friendship. I had no idea it was polite to decorate your walls in your friends' favorite foods!
715003 [laughs nervously] Oh, my.
7153f6 Where'd Spike and Starlight go? I feel like I'm being avoided. [snorts]
715003 Nooooo. They're just making sure everything is perfect for your welcome party later. In the meantime, how about I show you around town?
7153f6 Sounds good. I can't exactly learn about friendship if I don't make new friends.
715003 [sighs]
715361 [grunting, sighs]
715000 [door closes]
715361 Oh!
71527c Uh, hey, Thorax. Um, Twilight and Spike had some boring official paperwork to deal with, so looks like you and I get to hang out. What would you like to do?
715361 But I wanted to talk with Spike. He said he'd be right back.
71527c Oh, you will. But first, how about we grab a bite to eat?
715361 Huh. Well, you know, now that you've said it, I am a little hungry. Is there a dining room in the castle?
71527c No! I mean, yeah, but that's castle food. If you want the good stuff, we gotta go to town. Phew!
715005 ...and that's why you should never let cupcake flavors get in the way of your friendship.
71519a Huh. I guess I never thought of it that way. Thanks, Spike!
715005 Oh, come on! Glow!
715361 Spike! There you are! Uh, done with your boring paperwork, I see.
71527c [laughs nervously] Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
715005 Yep. [laughs] I am done with whatever Starlight says I was doing.
71527c Thorax wanted to get out of the castle. I thought coming to town was a really, really great idea.
715361 Well, maybe now we can talk.
715005 Uh, sssssure.
71527c I'll leave you guys to it.
715361 First of all, I want to say thank you for having me over. I'm in a bit of a leadership pickle, and I could use some advice.
715005 Well, I definitely want to help you out as quickly as possible.
715361 Here's my problem. There's this renegade group of changelings who still feed off of love. Even though I said, "Hey let's not do that anymore," they say, "Hey, this is how we've been doing things for hundreds of years..." [crossfades] ...but it's like they don't want to, even though I'm the leader and I have to... [fades out]
715000 [ponies sounding interested]
7153f6 Hello, I am Ember, daughter of Torch, winner of the Gauntlet of Fire, and lord of all dragons! [roars]
715000 [ponies scream]
7153f6 Usually when I do that, the dragons are eager to meet me.
715003 That's not how ponies make friends.
7153f6 Ah, I get it.
71513d [slurps]
7153f6 This is a weird friendship thing you ponies do, right?
715000 [splat]
715000 [honk!]
715000 [beat]
71527c Uh, you guys are in town, too?
7153f6 What are you talking about? You've been with me this whole time.
71527c No. I'm Starlight.
715000 [beat]
7153f6 Riiiight. I'm sorry, but you can't blame me. You both look and act so much alike.
715314 What?!
715361 ...and they said to me they just keep saying the same thing. You know, I think my leadership problem started in childhood. I must've been three when... [crossfades] ...three's a different story, a-and you've definitely gotta hear it. But the story about my brother was when I was two... or was I one?
7153f7 This is my seat! I saw it first!
7153f8 Well, I got here first!
715005 Thorax, uh, excuse me for a second.
7153f9 [growl]
715005 Ponies, please! If I may, I think I can help solve this friendship problem. You two should sit together. You both like the same place, you both ordered muffins, you're both ponies. I think if you made a little effort, you'd find— Whoa! Okay, that had to have done it. Come on, spikes. Glow! [strains, sighs]
715361 Hey, that was really great advice. So what do you think I should do?
715005 [gasps] Uh, actually, I, uh... need a minute... alone... to, uh, really come up with great advice! [pants] I'll be right back.
715361 [sighs] Great. No problem. Leave me again. It's fine.
7153f6 I'm just saying you're both purple ponies with purple hair. You both have cutie marks with sparkly things.
71527c [chuckles] Mine's more of a glimmer. Heh.
7153f6 How is that different? Oh, good. Spike. Can you please tell these two I'm right? They look very similar.
715005 Uh... Well, y'know, one thing friends do is let something go when it's upsetting somepony else.
7153f6 But I'm right! Besides, who are you to be telling me about friendship? I've barely seen you all day!
715005 Uh, well, I've seen you.
7153f6 Are you calling me a liar?!
715005 [chatters]
715361 Hey! No one yells at my friend!
715000 [transformation noise]
715361 [bear growl]
7153f6 Spike, get away from the bear!
715003 Actually, the bear is a changeling. And he's quite gentle.
715361 Not anymore! [bear roar]
7153f6 [roars]
715361 [bear growl]
715005 [screams] My worst fears are happening!
715005 Noooo!
715361 [pants] Back away, Spike! I'm not gonna let this dragon harm a scale on your back!
7153f6 You back away! I'm not gonna let you harm him! Wait. Did you say you're not gonna let me harm Spike?
715361 Yeah!
7153f6 But that's what I'm doing!
715361 Uh, what?
7153f6 Yeah, what?
715005 [panicked] Equestria as we know it is over! The war that pits changeling against dragon is about to begin! And it's all my fault! My title of Equestria's friendship ambassador is a lie—! Oh. Hey. You guys aren't fighting?
7153f6 Why would we be fighting?
715005 Because I accidentally invited you both over to Ponyville on the same day?
7153fa So what?
715005 So I... was trying to keep you apart because I didn't think you'd get along.
7153f6 Oh. I get it. You thought he wouldn't like me just because I'm a dragon and I'm bad at friendship?
715005 No, no, of course not! But— Wait. Isn't that why you're here?
7153f6 I can say I'm bad at friendship. You can't say it about me! You know what? I don't wanna talk about it.
715005 Wait, please! [sighs] [to Thorax] I'm sorry.
715361 No, no, it's cool. You thought I would be too soft, and someone like Ember would never respect me. Just like my own changelings!
715005 No, that's not it! Thorax, wait! Oh, no... What have I done?
715000 [splash]
715000 [kick]
715000 [splash]
7153f6 Why are you still here?
715361 [sighs] Because I'm having trouble leading my pack, so I don't really wanna go home.
7153f6 Wait, you're in charge? [chuckles] Oh, boy. You need to be more assertive.
715361 Well, that's my problem. I don't know how! I tried asking them to please follow my directions. I even offered a prize, and then—
7153f6 Shhh! Stop talking.
715000 [beat]
7153f6 That's how you do it.
715361 Whoa! That just gave me chills.
7153f6 I know you have it in you. You turned into a bear to defend Spike.
715361 Huh, I guess I can be tough when I'm defending my friends, but when I'm just enforcing my rules, I-I feel unsure of myself.
7153f6 There's nothing to be unsure of. You're the leader for a reason. Make a decision and let it be known that the decision is final. And if that doesn't work, turn into a bear.
715361 Oh, well, that's good advice.
7153f6 I know it is.
715361 So what's your deal? Why do you think you're so bad at friendship?
7153f6 I don't want to talk about it.
715361 Oh, you have to! How else are you gonna solve your problems?
7153f6 Through feats of strength and fire duels, of course. [grunts, roars]
715000 [explosion]
715361 Uh, how does that help?
715000 [crunch]
7153f6 Crushing another dragon in competition establishes my dominance and makes me feel great.
715361 Right, but, uh, how do you think they feel?
7153f6 Humiliated! Ashamed! They'd probably wanna run away and bury themselves under a rock and... never come out. They're probably sad. Kinda low. Definitely not happy.
715361 That's because that kind of competition can divide you. And it doesn't get to the heart of the issue. Talking about your feelings does.
7153f6 [sneezes] Ugh! I think I'm allergic to feelings.
715361 You know you don't have to be sappy...
7153f6 [blows]
715361 ...or huggy-feely about it! But you should let your friends know how you feel.
7153f6 Uh, I know where we can start.
715000 [whoosh]
715361 Where? Ohhhh. Spike. Hah. I got there.
715005 I think they're gone. They probably never want to see me again.
715000 [thuds]
71527c Or they want to see you now.
715005 [gulps]
7153f6 Guess what, Spike.
715005 I know. I'm so sorry.
7153f6 Let me talk about this! I... feel... [strains] mad. [sighs]
715361 Okaaaay... That's a good first attempt. Now maybe try to be more specific?
7153f6 [cracks limbs, breathes deeply] I'm... [sighs] upset!
715005 You have every right to be.
7153f6 I know I do! And I know I need to tell you how I feel because my friend Thorax said it would make me feel better. And it does!
715361 Yeah! And I have no problem telling you what you did was wrong because my friend Ember is helping me be more assertive!
715000 [thud]
715005 Whoa.
7153f6 Nice.
7153fa Ha-ha!
715005 You guys should be mad at me. I was so worried about how it could go wrong, I didn't even think about how it could go right. [sighs] Can you forgive me?
7153f6 I really do feel better. So, yeah. I'm good.
715361 Hah. Me, too. [pleased sounds]
7153f6 [groans] Again?
715005 [laughing]
715000 [spikes shimmering]
715005 No way! It's finally happening! I solved the friendship problem!
71527c Actually, you created the friendship problem by not trusting your friends.
715005 Yeah, but then I solved it by learning my lesson. I should have told my two friends about each other immediately instead of assuming they wouldn't get along.
715003 Good job, Spike.
7153f6 Is this another part of pony friendship? Telling each other what you learned all the time?
7153fb [giggling]
71527c Yeah, pretty much.
715005 Yup.
715000 [ponies chattering]
715005 [through loudspeaker] So, as a show of unity, I present the Dragon Fire Flame of Friendship to both Dragon Lord Ember and Thorax, leader of the changeling pack! May the flame of friendship burn for eternity.
715000 [ponies cheering]
7153f6 [sneezes]
715000 [whoosh]
715000 [crowd gasps]
715000 [beat]
7153f6 You should have more things made of rocks.
715000 [beat]
7153fc [laughing]
715000 [credits]
716008 [straining] [muffled] Hey, kid, get over here!
7160ff [straining]
716000 [thunk]
716008 Tents are lookin' good. And we made good time today. At this rate, we'll be at Winsome Falls by tomorrow!
71600a We should do the annual Big-Sister-Little-Sister camping trip every weekend!
716008 Then it wouldn't be annual. And if we did it every weekend, it probably wouldn't be as special.
71600a But the more we do it, the better we get at camping. Remember the first time we came here and Rarity had that ginormous tent?
71600d I heard that! [giggles] I've gotten much better at "roughing it", haven't I?
716066 Yup. This time, you only packed three suitcases.
71600d I know what you're thinking. But I promise, I only brought the essentials.
716008 Like those light thingies?
71600d Of course. What is life if you can't make it beautiful?
716000 [bushes rustling]
71600c Mmmm! These berries look good enough to eat!
716065 Don't! According to my book, they're extremely poisonous!
716000 [berries falling]
716065 [sighs]
716000 [leaf landing]
716065 [gasps]
716000 [snap]
716065 [grunts, screams]
71600c What?
716065 I heard something, I stepped on something, and I saw that creepy cave... I guess I still get a little bit scared out here, even after the last camping trip.
71600c Don't worry, kid. You've got a big sister this time.
71600a This looks amazing!
716065 This is gonna be the best Big-Sister-Slash-Little-Sister camping trip ever!
71600a [chewing]
716000 [tea being poured]
716000 [Fly-der buzzing]
716000 [splat]
716000 [Fly-der swarm buzzing]
716213 [screams]
716000 [theme song]
716000 [Fly-ders buzzing]
716213 [indistinct complaining]
716065 Ow! What are these things?! Aaagh!
716008 Fly-ders! Everypony, run for cover! Don't get stuck in their—
716000 [thud]
716008 ...web.
716000 [smack]
716066 [shrieks] Now what?!
71600c Follow me, everypony!
716065 Aaah! Not the scary cave!
716000 [whoosh]
716000 [Fly-der swarm buzzing]
716065 Where did those terrible bugs come from? And why did they destroy our camp?
71600c Ugh.
716008 Flyders are from the Luna Bay area. Never seen 'em this far east, though. Probably attracted to the food. Best wait here until they're gone.
71600a Oh, apple rot! What are we supposed to do now?! We had games to play and marshmallows to roast at camp! In here, we got nothin'!
71600d Mm, that's not entirely true. We have each other.
716008 That's right! And if you girls want to, maybe we could tell some stories to pass the time.
71600c You want stories? I've got a ton of stories! Spoiler alert – they're all about me and how awesome I am!
716008 I was thinkin' more like campfire stories?
71600a But we don't even have a campfire.
71600c I got this!
716000 [whoosh]
716000 [Fly-ders buzzing]
716000 [stinging noises]
716000 [whoosh]
716000 [thud]
716008 Wow. That was brave.
71600c [in discomfort] Eh... heh. It was no biggie. [coughs]
716065 We aren't gonna tell scary stories like our last camping trip, are we? It's bad enough just being in here!
716008 Don't worry, Scootaloo. I was gonna tell you mine and Apple Bloom's favorite legend.
71600a Ooh! You mean Rockhoof? I love that one! He was so strong, and when he—
716066 Apple Bloom, shhh! We haven't heard it yet!
71600a Oh, okay. But it's so good! Heh.
716008 Well, it's true. Rockhoof was known far and wide for his incredible strength. But he didn't start out that way. You see, Rockhoof was a tiny little fella, the son of a farmer.
71600a Just like us!
716000 [beat]
71600a [laughs nervously]
716008 They lived in a village that sat at the foot of a gigantic volcano.
716000 [flute music]
716000 [clink]
716008 [narrating] And the village was protected by an elite group of guard ponies called the Mighty Helm.
7163fd [laughing]
716000 [thunk]
716008 [narrating] Young Rockhoof wanted nothing more than to be part of the Mighty Helm.
716000 [straining noises]
716000 [thud]
7163fd [laughing]
716008 [narrating] But he was told that he was too scrawny and weak to protect the village.
7163fd [more laughing]
7163fe [whimper]
716008 [narrating] But Rockhoof wouldn't take no for an answer.
716008 [narrating] Then, one fateful day...
716000 [rumbling]
716008 [narrating] ...the volcano erupted!
716000 [boom!]
7163fe Eeeeeeeeeeee—
71600a [continued] —eeeeeeeeee! This is my favorite part!
7163ff What happened next?!
716008 The molten lava poured down the side of the volcano...
7163fd [indistinct chatter]
716008 [narrating] ...and try as they might, the Mighty Helm couldn't figure out a way to save the village! They had to evacuate. But the village ponies didn't wanna leave their homes. They spent their entire lives there. They had nowhere else to go! So Rockhoof decided to do something crazy.
716000 [digging]
716008 [narrating] He thought if he could divert the flow of the lava, he might be able to save his village. He started diggin' a trench!
716066 Wait a minute. All by himself?
71600c It'd be impossible for one pony to dig a trench fast enough to stop the lava. I mean, even I couldn't do that.
71600a [fangirl squealing]
716008 Good thing Rockhoof didn't believe in the word "impossible".
716008 [narrating] He continued to work, knowin' the odds were against him, but determined to push through it. Then, somethin' magical happened.
716000 [digging]
716000 [magic noises]
716008 [narrating] Rockhoof got visibly stronger! But the lava was getting' closer.
716000 [rapid speed digging]
716000 [crunch]
716000 [steam hissing]
716000 [ponies cheering]
716008 [narrating] Through his extraordinary determination and sheer force o' will, Rockhoof more than earned his place in the Mighty Helm.
7163fd [laughing]
716080 [cheering]
71600c Good story, Applejack! Even if it wasn't about me.
716400 [giggling]
71600a I love that story, no matter how many times I hear it.
71600d Why don't we see if it's safe to head back to camp?
716066 Uh, girls? There is no camp to go back to.
716000 [Fly-der swarm buzzing]
716401 [gasps]
716000 [Fly-der swarm buzzing]
716066 All our hard work is ruined!
71600d There, there, Sweetie Belle. Not to worry.
716066 How? Our camp was so pretty, and this cave is so... not.
71600d Oh, no-no-no-no, no, not true. There's beauty in everything. Even these blah rocks aren't really blah. If you look closely, you can see flecks of gold in them. And the way the firelight dances on the cave wall, shadow and light? Ooh, it's so gorgeous! Sweetie Belle, have I ever told you about my favorite legend?
716066 No. I didn't know you had one.
71600d Her name... was Mistmane.
71600c Mistmane? Isn't she the old wrinkly sorceress with the flower?
71600d Yeeees, but did you know she used to be the most beautiful unicorn in all the land?
71600c [flatly] No.
716080 So what happened to her?!
71600d Well, Mistmane was a very promising young sorceress.
716000 [Asian-style music]
71600d [narrating] She was as talented as she was beautiful and kind. Everypony loved her and missed her when she was sent to the finest magic school.
71600d [narrating] While she was gone, she was delighted to find out that her best friend, Sable Spirit, was crowned empress. She couldn't wait to return home once she finished her studies.
71600d [narrating] But once she arrived, she was devastated by what she saw.
716402 What happened here?
716403 The Empress happened. She makes everypony work day and night on her palace. We don't have time to take care of anything else.
716402 But that can't be. I know her! She would never do this.
71600d [narrating] But there was no denying what was in front of her.
716404 [gasps]
71600d [narrating] Sable Spirit took everything that was beautiful away from anypony else! And Mistmane was sure there had to be some explanation.
716066 I'd assume there was, too. If somepony told me either one of you two'd gone evil...
716065 Yeah, I'd never believe it.
71600a I dunno. I've seen the way you two get when you miss breakfast.
716000 [beat]
71600a [chuckles nervously] Just kiddin'. But I'd want answers too.
71600d So did Mistmane. She went to confront her friend.
716402 Sable, is that you?
716405 Don't tell me you don't recognize your old friend.
716402 I don't. My friend would never work our families and friends to the bone for something as silly as a palace.
716405 Silly? My palace is a beacon of beauty! Anypony who passes will be in awe of its majesty!
716402 What good is a pretty palace if it just hides the misery of its ponies?
716405 Beauty is everything. You taught me that.
716402 What?!
716405 You were always the pretty one. You got to go to the best magic school. Everypony missed you. Everypony loved you! I admit I was jealous, so I tried to perform a spell that would make me beautiful. You can see how that went!
716402 [gasps]
716405 I found if I couldn't have beauty, I would take it. I wasn't chosen to be empress, you know. I took it! Just like I'm going to take everything else.
716402 I can't let you do that.
716405 Let me? [laughs]
716000 [magic zaps]
716405 [grunts, growls]
716000 [magic dragons roaring]
716000 [magic zaps]
716000 [wood creaking]
716405 [grunts]
716000 [ponies cheering]
71600d [narrating] Everypony thought Sable Spirit was defeated, and that was that. But Mistmane knew there was more she could do to help.
71600d [narrating] Beauty isn't everything. But Mistmane knew that it does have the power to make ponies smile.
716000 [magic noises]
71600d [narrating] She made a huge sacrifice to bring that smile back to her friends' and family's faces... including Sable Spirit's.
716405 [gasps] You did this for me? Even after I was so cruel?
71600d [narrating] Sable Spirit was so touched that she vowed to be more like her friend in the ways that mattered. From then on, she ruled with kindness and compassion.
716000 [ponies cheering]
71600d [narrating] Even though she gave away her physical beauty, she dedicated her life to spreading beauty all over Equestria. Any time you go out of your way to brighten somepony's day by doing something like giving them flowers, you're following in the hoofsteps of Mistmane.
716066 I think she's my favorite legend too.
716000 [Fly-ders buzzing]
716000 [splat, hiss]
716065 [screaming]
71600c Ugh! These Fly-ders won't quit! What do they want from us now?
716008 Well, like it or not, we're food, too.
716066 And I've got the bites to prove it.
716065 [panicking] What are we gonna do?! They're almost here!
716000 [thwack]
716000 [rubble falling]
716000 [beat]
71600c What?! Now those bugs can't get in!
716065 [hyperventilating] And we can't get out!
716065 [hyperventilating]
716008 Let's all just stay calm. Let me re-light this fire...
716000 [sticks rubbing]
716000 [flames crackling]
71600d We just have to wait until the swarm moves on. Then we'll think of a way out.
716065 How long will that be?! Don't bears live in caves?! [moaning]
71600c Whoa-whoa-whoa, Scootaloo. You're focusing on the wrong things.
716065 You have a plan?!
71600c Close. I have a story.
716008 Lemme guess – it's about you?
71600c Practically. It's about my favorite legend, Flash Magnus!
71600a Wasn't he the pony who took on the dragons?
716065 Dragons?! Big, scary, mean ones or like Spike?
71600c Oh, these were definitely the big, scary, mean kind!
716065 [panicked sigh]
71600c But not too scary. You can sit closer to me if you want.
716000 [zoom-thump]
71600c A long time ago, before the Wonderbolts were even founded...
71600c [narrating] ...Flash Magnus was a lowly cadet in the Royal Legion.
716000 [heroic music]
716000 [smacks]
716000 [plane propellor noises]
71600c [narrating] And the Legion needed to fly over the Dragon Lands to get to their comrades on the other side. But as they got closer to the dragons...
716406 [coughing]
71600c [narrating] ...the dragons attacked!
716000 [dragons roaring]
716065 [shivering] You said this wasn't too scary!
71600c [very muffled] Scootaloo, if you just hang in there—
716065 What?
716000 [stretching, snap]
71600c I said if you just hang in there, I promise you'll like the ending. So, like I was saying, Flash Magnus and the Royal Legion tried to get past the dragons...
71600c [narrating] ...but the dragons wouldn't let them!
716000 [dragons roaring]
716407 Everypony, retreat!
71600c [narrating] Flash Magnus and a few other cadets were separated from the battalion. He managed to get away, but the dragons captured his friends and took them back to their lair!
716000 [Legion cadets screaming]
716000 [plane propellor noises]
716000 [thump]
716406 Commander! We need to save our captured comrades!
716407 I appreciate your loyalty, Flash Magnus, but getting past those dragons is going to be impossible. Nothing will work.
71600a The commander was right. You can't outfight dragons.
71600c But you can out-think them.
716406 Commander Ironhead, I'm pretty sure I can outfly the dragons. If I can lure them into chasing me, you can all sneak into the lair and retrieve our friends before they get back.
716407 Are you really willing to take that chance, soldier?
716406 I am, sir.
716407 It's a very brave thing you're doing. You'll need all the help you can get.
716000 [clank, shing!]
716406 Is this... Netitus, the fireproof shield?!
716407 It has protected Legion heroes for generations. And today, I can't think of a worthier flank for Netitus to protect.
716000 [clank]
716407 Good luck, soldier.
716000 [plane propellor noises]
716406 [exhales] [shouting] Hey! Come and get me, fire-breath! If you can! [clanking shield] Hey, hey! Come and get me! Hey, I'm over here!
716000 [dragon roars]
71600c [narrating] While Flash Magnus bravely flew for his life, Commander Ironhoof was able to get his soldiers back.
716000 [dragons roaring]
716000 [plane propellor noises]
71600c [narrating] Flash Magnus flew like the wind...
716000 [dragon roaring]
716000 [shield burning]
71600c [narrating] ...faster than the dragons!
716000 [burning]
71600c [narrating] But he knew he couldn't do this forever. Luckily, he had a plan.
716000 [lightning striking]
716000 [electricity crackling]
716407 [whistles]
716000 [plane propellor noises]
71600c [narrating] He led the dragons straight into a storm that the Legion had planted!
716000 [lightning striking]
71600c [narrating] One taste of the lightning, and the dragons retreated.
716000 [long pause]
716000 [pomf]
716406 [coughs]
71600c [narrating] Flash Magnus' plan worked!
716000 [Legion cadets cheering]
716065 Wow! I did like that ending.
71600c Told ya! He always inspired me to be my brave and awesome self.
71600a Mm-hmm!
716008 Yeah, I guess he kinda reminds me of you.
71600c Tch! You guess? Come on, I'm just like him!
716400 [laughing]
716008 Hey, do you hear that?
71600a Uh, I don't hear anythin'.
716008 Exactly! Those gosh-darn Fly-ders are gone! We can get out!
716000 [thumping]
716000 [rockslide]
716008 Whoa!
71600d Or not.
716008 We're gonna have to see if we can get out the other way.
716065 You mean go further into the dark, spooky cave?!
71600c Scootaloo, just remember the story. Gotta be brave like me and Flash Magnus, okay?
716000 [water rushing]
71600c I hear water!
71600d And if there's flowing water, then...
716008 ...it might lead to the way out!
716080 Whoa!
71600d Okay, on three. One, two—
716081 Three!
716000 [splashes]
716000 [waterfall sounds]
71600a Woo-hoo!
716066 Yeah-ha-ha!
716008 Huh. Well, what do you know? We found ourselves a shortcut to Winsome Falls!
716065 [sighs] It's never looked so beautiful.
71600d Well, almost.
716000 [snapping]
71600a [gasps]
716008 We sure are sorry that our camping trip wasn't what we hoped it would be.
71600a Are you kidding? This trip is awesome!
71600d It is?
716066 We got to hear legendary stories and go on an adventure.
716008 Wait, you three wanna stay?
716080 Of course we do!
716066 We could turn those trees into a nice little shelter!
71600a We can get you some big logs and branches to help build it!
716065 And I bet we could find some more berries! Come on! I can't wait to see what happens next year!
716000 [credits]
717000 [teleportation zap]
71727c Ha! Straight to the changeling hive! I told you I could do it.
717037 Well, not exactly straight, Starlight. We've been popping all around Equestria, and we still have to walk.
71727c [scoffs] It's like twelve steps away. Before Chrysalis' throne was destroyed, the closest magic would've gotten us was waaaaaaay over there. On a scale of one to ten, how happy do you think Thorax is gonna be about our surprise visit?
717037 Definitely ten. I mean, who wouldn't be happy at the chance to marvel at the overwhelming talent that is the Great and Powerful Trrrrrixie?!
717000 [fireworks]
71727c Trixie, we're coming to offer Thorax encouragement and support. His letters make it seem like the responsibilities of being a changeling leader are a little overwhelming.
717037 Yeah. I know. That's basically what I said.
71727c He's dealing with the wants and needs of his subjects. Redesigning the hive, a dread maulwurf wreaking havoc outside...
717037 It does sound like a lot, but are you sure that last thing is real?
71727c The dread maulwurf? Sure it is. Thorax said it's like half-bear, half-mole, half-raging-pile-of-claws! But now that the changelings don't feed on the love of everything around them, plants have started to grow back. But this maulwurf keeps eating them all up.
717037 "Maulwurf". Uh-huh. You're just trying to scare me, but it won't work. Because not only am I the Great and Powerful, I am also the Unscareable Trixie!
717408 [growls]
717037 [screams] Please tell me Thorax also mentioned a terrifying-looking changeling who greets visitors but is actually nice!
71727c [meakly] Nope.
717408 And I'm not nice. [growls]
717000 [magic blasts]
717037 Starlight, you got us here. I'll take us home. Teleportation spell, go! Did I save us?
71727c Nope.
717000 [dun-dun-dun]
717000 [theme song]
717000 [suspenseful music]
717037 What are you waiting for?! Use some magic to get us outta here!
71727c Calm down, "Unscareable Trixie". We have to find out what's going on. Thorax might need our help.
717037 We need our help! Teleportation spell, go! Teleportation spell, go! [gasps] Teleportation spell—!
71727c Ugh! Why do you keep doing that? You know it doesn't work that way.
717037 I know, but this is my process.
717000 [thud]
71732e [yelp]
717408 I've captured these trespassers!
717361 Starlight! Trixie! It's okay, Pharynx. You can let them go.
717408 But they were lurking on our grounds! In the old days, I would've already feasted on their love.
717361 Well, that's why they're called the "old days", because they're old. We don't do that anymore.
717000 [celestial music]
717408 Dah! I liked the old days better.
717361 Uh, what are you two doing here?
71727c We wanted to surprise you. [sheepishly] Surprise.
717361 Well, it's great to see you! I'm sorry about the welcome committee.
717408 [hisses]
717000 [changelings yelp]
71727c I thought Ember helped you get more assertive so you could deal with all the renegade changelings who didn't wanna change.
717361 Oh, she did. Really helpful. I was able to convince all of them to change, except one of them... My brother.
71727c Your brother?
717361 Yep. Pharynx is my elder broodmate.
717408 Ha! [grunting]
71727c Oh, yeah. You guys have the same... um... eye shape?
717408 What a ridiculous comparison! We are nothing alike!
717361 [sighs]
717408 [grunts]
717361 Stop doing that!
717408 The hive looked better with holes. [hissing]
717000 [plink]
717361 Ugh. Well, how about I show you the rest of the hive where it's less loud and bangy?
717361 There've been a lot of changes since you were here last. I'm trying to start some new activities since the only thing we did before was hunt and patrol. There's theatre, swing dancing, a once-a-week potluck lunch. Ooh! And who can change shape and organize craft time? Hmm? [transformation noise] This guy!
71727c I am really impressed, Thorax. The hive, all the activities...
717409 Gah! He did it again! Pharynx dumped an entire can of black paint on me! He said my fuchsia color wasn't "intimidating to our enemies"! What enemies?!
717361 I am so sorry. I promise I'll talk to him.
717409 You're the ruler of the hive, Thorax! You need to do more than talk!
717037 Well, maybe not everything here is amazing.
71727c Seriously, Thorax. What is up with your brother?
717361 Ugh. Pharynx used to be head of patrol. But now we're peaceful and there's no need to patrol, so he just stalks around the hive making everyone miserable. The other changelings are sick of it, and if I can't get him to accept love and friendship and change like the rest of us, everything I've done here is at risk.
717000 [beat]
717037 Uh-uh.
71727c [encouragingly] Hmm?
717037 [sighs] Uh-huh.
71727c We know a thing or two about what it's like to be outsiders. Maybe we could talk to him for you.
717361 Do you really think you can help?
717037 Thorax, if there's anypony who can help your brother, it's me. And with Starlight helping, it might take slightly longer, but I guarantee you we can do it.
71727c [groan]
71740a Thorax, we're ready to start work on the trail of plants to lead the maulwurf away.
717361 Oh, I have to head outside. You sure you're okay handling Pharynx?
71727c Absolutely.
717408 [angry grunting]
717037 Yeah... we totally got this. [chuckles nervously]
717408 [continues grunting]
717408 [angry grunting]
717037 So, how do you wanna play this? I'm thinking "good pony/bad pony". You yell and blast him with magic while my natural charisma will convince him that— uh, Starlight?
71727c Hey, Pharynx. I know when we first met, it didn't go so well.
717408 I put you in a bag. I thought it went great. [grunts]
71727c Right. [clears throat] So... not a big fan of the vines, huh?
717408 They're a safety hazard. An enemy could hide in them or use them as weapons. I don't even know why they're here.
71727c Because they're pretty?
717408 That's ridiculous.
71727c Oh, totally. We get you. But... [clears throat] maybe don't express how you feel by destroying them?
717408 I don't take advice from ponies. The only thing I take from you is breakfast. At least, I used to.
717037 You know, you're a lot like us!
717408 Doubt it.
717037 It's true. Do you know who Twilight Sparkle is?
717408 No.
717037 Well, she's the most well-liked, studious, do-goodiest pony in Equestria.
717408 Ugh! She sounds awful.
717037 Oh, you'd hate her. I used to. She made me unsure about my place in the world, which led me to act out against her.
71727c And I used to be a dictator who ran a village with an iron hoof.
717408 Really? Hmm. Maybe you two do understand me.
71727c Yes! We do! But now, Trixie has come to terms with being second-best, and I no longer control ponies against their will. And our lives are so much better for it.
717408 Wow. So you're both losers. Stay away from me, or I'll do to you what I did to the vines.
717361 Well, "Operation Lead Maulwurf Away" is coming along. How'd it go with Pharynx?
71727c Your brother is, um, challenging.
717361 Oh, that bad, huh?
71727c It wasn't great.
717361 You wanna talk it out? You can come with me to the feelings forum.
717037 The feel-like-what-now?
717361 Oh, it's a place for changelings to express their feelings so we all gain a better understanding of each other. It's really helped bring the hive closer together.
71740b Sometimes I feel like I'm a blue changeling. Sometimes I feel like I'm a purple changeling. But here I am, a green one.
71740c You can be anything you want to be. Be blue one day and purple the next. Be both on the same day!
71740b But then I feel like I'd be living a lie.
71740c It's very brave of you to share something so personal. Does anyone else have similar concerns?
71739d I used to, but craft time has given me such a creative outlet, I feel great now!
71740d Uh-huh. Everyone loves craft time.
717000 [changelings agreeing]
71739d Well, everyone except for... you-know-who.
71740d Yeah. You-know-who spends all his craft time making spears.
71739d He's scary and intimidating. You-know-who makes me uncomfortable.
71740b He makes us all uncomfortable.
717361 Everyone, please! I understand Pharynx can be challenging at times.
71739d That's an understatement. He lined a hallway with thorns!
71740b He teaches little changelings to growl and hiss!
71740e My soup's too hot!
717000 [beat]
71740e What? I thought the feelings forum was for sharing our problems.
717408 It sounds like your lame "feelings forum" is for talking about me behind my back!
71740c The feelings forum is for talking about anything that's bothering you. Is there something you'd like to share, Pharynx?
717408 Actually, there is. The changelings used to be a fearsome swarm! Now we sit around talking about our feelings so much, you can't even stop a maulwurf from eating all your "pretty plants"! I could've sent that thing packing before, but I guess now we'll just try to lead it away and hope that keeps us safe!
71739d I don't feel safe with him around!
71740b I'd feel safer if he were gone!
717361 I can't do that.
71740f We want him banished! [arguing]
71740e [slurps] Hey, my soup's cooled down! These feeling forums are great for solving problems!
717000 [BWONG!]
71740c Everyone, please. If we are interrupting each other, we are not affirming each other.
717000 [changelings resume arguing]
71740c That's it! Feelings forum is over!
717000 [changelings grumbling]
71727c I... [sighs] I want to say something, but it goes against everything I've been taught as Twilight's pupil.
717037 Ooh! Then, by all means, say it.
71727c [sighs] I think Pharynx is a lost cause.
717037 Mm. I'm all for second chances. Third, even. But he just seems like a bad bug.
71727c And Thorax has a duty to the whole hive, not just his brother.
717037 If he keeps sticking up for Pharynx, the hive might decide they don't want Thorax as their leader.
71727c I think he might have to kick Pharynx out. But I don't wanna be the one to tell Thorax that.
717037 Me, neither. But somepony probably should. I nominate you!
71727c Ugh!
717000 [transformation noise]
71727c Thorax, we have something to tell you.
717361 It's about Pharynx, isn't it?
717037 [hesitating] Mmmmmmmaybe?
717361 Look, I know he's an aggressive warrior type, but when I was little, every young changeling wanted to be like that.
717000 [young changelings shouting]
717361 [voiceover] ...Every young changeling except me. The others would pick on me for not wanting to fight.
717411 Look at the little grub playing with his dollies!
717000 [young changelings laugh]
717412 Step away from my brother!
717000 [slam]
717361 [voiceover] But Pharynx never let them hurt me.
717411 We were just complimenting his dollies.
717000 [transformation noise]
717412 [shrieks]
717000 [young changelings scream]
717000 [transformation noise]
717413 Thanks, Pharynx.
717412 Why are you hitting yourself?! Stop hitting yourself! Why are you hitting yourself?!
717413 Ouch! Cut it out, Pharynx!
717412 They're right, you know. You need to have tougher skin.
717037 Aw, that was a really sweet story. Until the end.
717361 I know Pharynx loved me in his own way, and I know there's still good in him. That's why I keep sticking up for him. Anyway, what did you wanna talk to me about?
717037 Me? Oh, noooo. But, uh, Starlight has something she—
71727c Actually, Thorax, um, never mind! C'mon, Trixie, we've got a... thing to do.
717037 [whispering] What are you doing? I thought we agreed you'd tell Thorax he had to kick his brother out of the hive!
71727c Maybe we don't have to. Get Pharynx and meet me at the hive entrance. I'll explain everything.
717000 [magic zap]
717037 And how am I supposed to know where Pharynx is?!
717414 I just saw Pharynx.
717037 Oh! Well, that was easy.
71727c We'll just use one problem to solve another. I switched the trail of plants around to lure the maulwurf here. The changelings may not be able to stop it anymore, but Pharynx certainly can. When it attacks, he'll save his brother, showing everypony his good side, the others will accept him, and Pharynx will finally let love and friendship into his life and transform! [pants]
717037 Wow.
71727c I know, right? Great idea? Where's Pharynx?
717037 He's gone.
71727c Gone like gone to the throne room?
717037 Gone like gone! One of the changelings said Pharynx left the hive for good!
717000 [changelings cheering]
71727c [gasp] Then who's gonna stop the dread maulwurf I'm leading here?!
717000 [changelings screaming]
71727c [panting] Thorax, there you are! Pharynx is missing!
717000 [changelings cheering]
717037 Wait for it...
71727c And the dread maulwurf is coming this way!
717000 [changelings screaming]
717037 Told ya.
717361 That doesn't make any sense. The trail of plants should have led the dread maulwurf away.
71727c [nervous laugh] I might have relaid them to lead it back toward the hive.
717361 Why would you do that?!
71727c I thought if Pharynx saw you were in danger, the loving, caring side of him would come out when he protected you!
717361 But instead, he's out there alone somewhere between us and that rampaging monster?! I have to save him!
71727c I'm coming with you!
717361 Of course you are! This is all your fault!
717037 [condescending] Oh, don't be too hard on Starlight. Her heart was in the right place.
717361 You're coming, too!
717037 Oh. Right. I mean, I was gonna volunteer anyway...
717361 Who else is coming?
717000 [beat]
717361 [groans] Fine.
71727c Oh, sure, you could all stay here, not help Pharynx and he won't bother you anymore. It's your choice. But remember when you didn't have a choice! When you were forced to obey Chrysalis! You might have been unstoppable, but you weren't free to choose! And now you are, because of Thorax! Well, it's his brother out there, and now it's your chance to prove you're just as strong embracing love as you were feeding on it! Now is your chance to show what changelings can really be! Not because you have to, but because you choose to!
717037 That was an amazingly epic speech, Starlight! I just can't believe not a single changeling was moved by it.
717361 I can't blame them. If he wasn't my brother, I don't think I'd be here. We're gonna have to face the maulwurf by ourselves.
71727c Maybe it'll be long gone and we'll find Pharynx out here alone!
717000 [roar]
717408 [grunts]
71727c Or maybe not.
717000 [maulwurf growling]
717000 [transformation noise]
717000 [Pharynx-bug skreeing]
717361 Pharynx!
717408 What are you doing here?!
717361 I'm here to save you!
717408 Get outta here! Let me handle this!
71727c We're not leaving you!
717000 [maulwurf growling and roaring]
717000 [magic zap]
717000 [maulwurf roaring]
717361 [nervous] I may have forgotten to mention in my letters that maulwurfs have really thick hides!
717000 [maulwurf growling and snapping]
71727c I thought you said you could beat this thing!
717408 Yeah, with the rest of the swarm! Not alone!
71739d Good thing you're not alone!
717037 I told you it was an epic speech.
717000 [changeling battle-cry]
717000 [smack!]
717000 [thud]
717000 [maulwurf roars]
717361 It's no use! We're out of practice and he's too tough!
717000 [maulwurf roars]
717037 And strong! Too bad we can't get it to fight itself!
717408 That's it! Thorax, remember when we were young and I made you hit yourself?
717361 Now is not the time to make fun of me, Pharynx!
717000 [beat]
717361 Oh, right! Of course!
717000 [maulwurf roaring]
717000 [slap]
717408 Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself?!
717361 Yeah, maulwurf, why are you hitting yourself?
717000 [crunch]
717361 Why are you hitting yourself, huh? Huh? Huh?
717000 [thud]
717408 [hisses]
717000 [crunch]
717037 Ooh, that looks like it hurts.
717000 [maulwurf roars]
717000 [digging]
71727c We did it! It's gone!
717000 [changelings cheering]
717361 What were you doing out here?
717408 Leaving. I'm done with all of you.
717361 Oh. It's just, why bother fighting the maulwurf then? You coulda left it alone.
717408 Well, I couldn't just let it attack you!
717361 But I thought you were done with us, and you didn't care.
717408 I never said that. The hive is the thing I care about most.
717361 Well, you certainly don't act like it.
717408 Well, I'm sorry if I don't get excited about pretty flowers and feeling circles and—
717361 It's a feelings forum.
717408 Whatever. It doesn't matter. Even if I do care about the hive, I obviously don't have a place there anymore.
71739d Actually, you do. Because we've been wrong. Um, the hive may be a gentler, nicer place...
71740d ...but that doesn't mean we won't have to defend ourselves. Clearly.
717361 And who better to help us do that than the only changeling who never stopped protecting us?
717000 [changelings chattering]
717408 You all want me to stay?
717361 Unless you still want to leave the hive.
717408 Why would I want that? I love the hive!
717000 [changelings cheering]
717000 [magic noises]
717000 [changelings oohing and aahing]
717037 He did it! He transformed!
71727c I always knew you had it in you!
717408 Really? Because I thought you said I was a lost cause and you were going to tell Thorax he should kick me out.
717037 Oh! Starlight! How could you say that?
71727c Ugh! What?! That's—! I mean—! But you—!
717361 Lucky for us, you weren't a lost cause.
717408 Lucky for me, you didn't give up on me.
717000 [changelings chattering]
717037 Soooo... glad everything worked out.
717361 Yeah! Let's talk about how you not only led the maulwurf to the hive but also drove my brother away from it!
71727c I am so sorry about that, but I would like to point out that my admittedly terrible plan did bring everything together in the end. [nervous laugh]
717408 Hey. Do you guys want to hear the story about how I used to make Thorax hit himself?
71727c [relieved] Oh, absolutely, yes, right now!
717408 Well, when we were young, every changeling wanted to be a warrior. Except for Thorax. He was a little weak. I had to protect him... [fades out]
717000 [credits]
718415 Morning, Pinkie Pie. Get your Ponyville Chronicle right here!
718007 Fan-tizzy-astic! I just love to read about happy happenings, and it's always good to be a pony in the know, you know? And there's so much to know!
71800c Eh, seems like a bunch of boring hooey to me.
718007 Does "New Shrubbery In Castle Garden" sound like boring hooey to you?
71800c Snooze.
718007 What about... "Parasprite Infestation In Fillydelphia Eradicated"? Ah! That's great news!
71800c Eh. Another day, another parasprite hype story.
718007 [reading] "Noodles Named Official Food Of Whinnyapolis". "Author A. K. Yearling Announces Retirement". "Cloudsdale Election Heating Up For Candidate In Favor Of Cooling It Down".
71800c What?! Let me see that!
718007 I never knew you were so into politics, Rainbow.
71800c No, this! It can't be true...
718007 I'd have never have picked noodles as the official food of Whinnyapolis either, but here we are.
71800c No, Pinkie! I can't believe that the greatest author and secret pony adventurer of all time, A. K. Yearling... is retiring!
718000 [theme song]
718007 A. K. Yearling just retired. Like, today. Are you sure she wants visitors?
71800c Pinkie, the A. K. Yearling I know would never quit and retire out of the blue! Something could be really wrong, and we need to make sure she's okay!
718007 Okay! Heeeey... You're not just trying to make sure she writes more Daring Do books, are you?
71800c Of course not! But that wouldn't hurt either. Now, come on!
718000 [rapid knocking]
71800c Uh, maybe she's not home. Maybe she went to the editor-in-chief of the Ponyville Chronicle to correct the misprint they've made.
718007 Nope. She's home.
71800c How do you know?
718007 Because she's right there looking all sad and alone.
71800c [gasps] I knew it! Something is wrong! [knocking rapidly] A. K!
718007 Now she's sighing with the weight of the world. Now she's hanging her head in utter despair. Now she's shaking her hoof and cursing the heavens like nothing could ever possibly be the same again. Why, oh, why did this happen to her?!
71800c What?!
718007 Whoops. Never mind. That time, she was just stretching. [chuckles]
71800c A. K., it's us! Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie! Your friends!
718000 [door opens]
71800c Oh, no. Did somepony ransack your cottage again and steal some ancient, mysterious relic that's the key to saving all of Equestria?!
718007 Oooh! Sparky!
718356 [gasps]
718000 [chest closes]
718356 [sighs] Nothing's been stolen.
71800c Then is somepony blackmailing you and forcing you to retire? 'Cause if they are...!
718356 No. Nothing like that.
71800c So you're just quitting and moving away? Why... would... you... do... that?!
718356 I already explained everything to the Ponyville Chronicle.
71800c Oh, really? [reading] "Author A. K. Yearling announced yesterday that the next adventure novel in her popular series, 'Daring Do and the Curse of the Pharaoh's Tomb', will be her last. Yearling looks forward to her retirement." That doesn't explain anything!
718356 [groans]
71800c It just says you're giving up writing stories. But most ponies don't know that you actually are Daring Do and that the stories are real. So what you're really saying is that you're giving up being Daring Do, but you're not saying why!
718007 Of course, if you don't feel like talking about it, that's A-okay, A. K.! As your friends, we completely understand. Right, Rainbow Dash?
71800c Oh. Yeah. We just came to make sure you're all right. That's really why we wanted to find out what's going on.
718356 If you really want to know... My last quest took me to a village in Southern Equestria, where I started seeing these.
718007 [reading] Wake Of Destruction - Daring Do Ruins Entire Village Marketplace!"
71800c [reading] Dare Or Scare - Local Rogue Daring Do Involved In Frightful Fiasco"?
718007 [reading] "Daring Do Leads Bull Into China Shop During High-Speed Chase—"
718356 That's enough! [sighs] Everypony I tried to help is mad at me.
718007 That's not true. They're not mad at A. K. Yearling. They're mad at Daring Do.
718356 They don't sell my books in Southern Equestria. The ponies there don't know who A. K. Yearling is. They only know Daring Do, and apparently she does more harm than good.
718007 Then I guess it's a good thing you look so different as A. K. Yearling!
71800c So all we have to do is go down there and explain to these ponies that none of this stuff is true.
718007 Easy-peasy-cheesy!
718356 But that's just the thing – it is true.
718030 What?!
718356 I guess I've always been so focused on saving priceless relics and stopping the bad guys that I never really thought about the mess I leave behind.
718007 Then you are in a tricky pickle. But why is all this happening now?
718356 [sighs] I guess ponies are finally fed up. Either way, I'm done with adventures, having or writing.
71800c Come on! For every one pony who's upset, there must be at least a hundred that know you're a hero!
718356 I don't think so, Dash.
71800c Well, why don't we go visit this village "Som...nam...bu...la" and see for ourselves?
718356 Those articles seem to make it pretty clear how the villagers feel.
718007 But if we go there, the ponies can tell you in person just how much they appreciate you.
71800c And what a heap of rotten apple cores these articles are!
718356 You really think so?
71800c I know so! Let's go!
718356 [sighs]
718000 [adventurous music]
71800c [squealing] This is so cool! It looks just like that village in your last book where Daring Do recovers the Doomed Diadem from the Wild Bunch Gang who chase after her through the desert!
718356 It should. I based that entire chapter on my experiences here in Somnambula.
718007 What happens? No, wait, don't tell me. I changed my mind! Tell me!
71800c Daring Do thwarts Ahuizotl's evil plot to separate the Sister Crown Relics. And if it wasn't for her, the region would be cursed with eternal night, and the entire town of Somnambula would have sunk into the ground!
718007 Ah, puh! There's no chance that these ponies don't think you're a hero.
71800c Watch this. [to "Cortland"] Hiya there, mister! I was hoping you could tell me about a pony named Daring Do. I hear she's an awesome adventure-pony hero.
718416 Daring Do? Oh, she's awesome, all right. Awesome at destroying ponies' apple carts...
718000 [crash]
718416 ...and priceless, sacred statues!
718202 Indeed. Daring Do is a menace who destroys everything she touches!
718000 [murmurs of agreement]
71800c What?! No! Daring Do is the exact opposite of a menace!
718356 Ugh! I tried to tell you! Coming back here was a mistake!
71800c Come on, A. K.! So we picked a bad example. That was just one angry pony.
718007 Two angry ponies!
718356 It doesn't matter! I never should have come with you! You two should just go home!
71800c Come on! We gotta follow her!
718007 I dunno. It really seemed like she doesn't want us cramping her saddle.
71800c But we have to convince her that ponies do appreciate her! As her friend, I have to make sure she believes that.
71800c Look, Pinkie! It's the Get On Inn! Daring Do stays here all the time in her adventures. Which means there must be ponies here who love Daring Do! Maybe they can help us.
718007 [sniffing] Mmmmm. My nose is telling me to help myself to muffins.
718000 [bell ringing]
71800c Come on...
718007 Ooh, she's fancy. I got this. [to Mrs Trotsworth] A good evening to you, madame. We are but weary travelers who humbly wish to inquire on the status of a certain mare of intrigue taking residence here.
718417 What in Southern Equestria are you on about?
718007 Is it true that Daring Do stays here?
718417 Ha! Not anymore, she doesn't!
71800c Why not?
718417 The last time I rented that rascal a room, she was in such a rush to hightail it outta here, she didn't even pay her bill!
71800c But—
718417 After that, a band of ruffians showed up and destroyed half the rooms looking for her. Guess she made them even more mad than she made me!
71800c No, no, no. You've got it all wrong.
718417 Hmph! How do you figure?
71800c Daring Do was trying to save everypony from the curse of the Doomed Diadem of Xilati. And she was only in a rush because she had to get the crown back to the Tiara of Teotlale before the curse took effect. [to Pinkie Pie] Chapter seventeen.
718417 Sounds like a tall tale to me. And a hard one to believe, now that I know Daring Do is a scoundrel and a thief! Every year, ponies come to offer precious glowpaz to the Somnambula statue in the village in hopes for a good future. Why, that poor fella had his glowpaz necklace stolen by Daring Do just yesterday!
71800c Hmmm...
718030 [gasps] There's A. K.!
718202 Daring Do ruined our town and stole our precious glowpaz! We need to make sure that if she turns up again, there will be consequences! Everypony who's with me, meet at the statue tomorrow!
718000 [ponies agreeing]
718356 [sighs] Now I'm getting blamed for things I didn't even do? Why would I steal from them?
718007 They are super bad! But we're still staying the night, right? [chomp] Because I already ate all the free mini muffins! [giggles]
71800c Listen, A. K. After a good night's sleep, we're going to fix all of this. I promise.
718000 [ponies murmuring]
718356 I shouldn't be here, Rainbow Dash. This is never gonna work.
71800c Of course it will! All I have to do is go up there and explain to everypony how wrong they all are.
718007 Yeah! And then I'll be like, "What she said!"
718356 [sighs] Easy-peasy-cheesy...
718007 Exactly!
718202 Here it is! The remains of your– I mean, our Somnambula statue! Now that Daring Do has destroyed it, tell me, where will we hang our glowpaz?
718418 We don't even have any glowpaz because they were stolen by Daring Do!
718000 [ponies shouting and booing]
71800c Daring Do would never steal anything! And okay, she destroyed your statue, but it was because she was trying to save you all from Ahuizotl!
718000 [confused chattering]
71800c Ahuizotl? He's about yea big? Long neck? Itty-bitty face? Weird claw thingy on his tail?
718007 Ooh! Ooh! I know him! He's a baddie!
718000 [concerned murmuring]
71800c Trust me, if Ahuizotl had gotten away with the Doomed Diadem, your entire village would have been swallowed up! And that's a lot worse than losing some crummy old statue!
718000 [ponies gasping]
718416 Ahem! This was not some crummy old statue! It was the namesake of our town! If you want to understand us, you must first understand her.
71800c Who?
718416 Somnambula. Long ago...
718416 [narrating] ...this village fell prey to an evil Sphinx who demanded most of their crops. Like her fellow villagers, Somnambula didn't have much, but she used what she had to keep others from giving up hope. The son of the Pharaoh, Prince Hisan, was so moved by her compassion that he decreed nopony would go hungry again. But when Hisan stood up to the Sphinx, the beast captured him, telling the Pharaoh the only way to get Hisan back was to solve her riddle. Nopony would volunteer to save the prince. Nopony except Somnambula.
718000 [adventurous music]
718416 [narrating] The Sphinx gave her the riddle. "I shine brightest in the dark. I am there but cannot be seen. To have me costs you nothing. To be without me costs you everything." As Somnambula thought of the hardship she and her fellow villagers had experienced, she instantly knew the answer. "Hope!", she shouted.
718000 [Sphinx roaring]
718416 [narrating] The Sphinx was so enraged, it seemed she might still refuse to release the prince, so Somnambula asked her for one more challenge. But if she accomplished it, the Sphinx would leave from the kingdom forever. The Sphinx quickly agreed, asking only that Somnambula walk to the prince across a deep chasm... blindfolded! Further, the Sphinx had cast a powerful spell that prevented Somnambula from flying.
718000 [Sphinx laughing evilly]
718416 [narrating] But Somnambula never lost hope! She knew she'd need to make a leap of faith to save the prince. Guided by the sound of the prince's voice... she easily made it across.
718000 [Sphinx roaring]
718416 [narrating] The Pharaoh asked how Somnambula prevailed, and she explained that she had always hoped she could make things better for her people and that hope had carried her through. The Prince replaced the pearls Somnambula gave up with a string of glowpaz. And around her neck, they glowed bright enough to light the entire kingdom.
718416 Forever after, glowpaz became our symbol of hope.
718000 [ponies chattering]
71800c Wow. I had no idea how special the statue was to you. Somnambula sounds like a pretty cool pony. But I bet if she were here, she'd tell you how cool Daring Do is too, because they've both fought to protect this town!
718000 [ponies chattering]
718202 If Somnambula were here today, she would condemn Daring Do for destroying your– our symbol of hope!
718000 [ponies booing and shouting]
71800c Hey, buddy! What did Daring Do ever do to you to deserve all this?!
718202 Only... everything!
71800c Dr Caballeron?!
718202 Yes... Rainbow Dash. [laughing evilly] When I saw you, her closest friend, I knew that Daring Do would not be far behind. I really do owe you for leading her right to me.
71800c But I-I didn't mean to—
718202 Thank you for helping me break Daring Do's spirit by destroying her reputation, but I can't have you running off and telling her my plan. [whistles]
71800c Help!
718356 Caballeron?! No!
718007 He's got Rainbow Dash! Come on!
718007 [panting] I'm... coming... Rainbow... Dash... [to Daring Do] Ah! I knew you'd come!
71814e You did? I sure didn't. What if I cause more trouble?
718007 You won't.
71814e How do you know?
718007 I just do! You wouldn't let anything happen to Rainbow Dash. You care too much.
71814e You're right. Which way did they go? To the pyramid!
71800c Somepony help! Somepony! Anypony! Pinkie Pie?! Daring Do?! Is that you?!
718007 Don't worry, Rainbow! We'll save you!
718000 [rumbling, gurgling]
718202 [laughing evilly] If my previous plan didn't cause you to give up, Daring Do, then the shame of losing your dear friend Rainbow Dash to the slime will! Oh, and that ancient magic from the legend is real. There'll be no flying in the pyramid! Good luck, Daring Do! [laughing evilly]
718000 [slam]
71814e [grunting] He's right! We'll never get to her in time!
718007 If this really is like Somnambula's story, then we just have to have hope that we can.
71814e I think we need more than hope, Pinkie. There was a bridge in the story, and there's no bridge here. What are we going to do?
71800c [whimpering]
718007 I don't know, but Rainbow Dash is our friend. Just like Somnambula. We need to make a leap of faith and hope that we can save her! [grunts]
71814e Pinkie!
718000 [steam rushing]
71814e Aha!
718007 Wheeee! [giggles] I knew we'd do it!
71814e Thanks for reminding me to never give up hope, Pinkie.
71800c And I'm kinda "hoping" you ponies will untie me before we all take a bath in bubbling green slime!
71814e We're on it!
718000 [steam rushing]
718000 [ponies chattering]
71814e Not so fast, Caballeron!
718201 [gasps]
718000 [glowpaz clattering]
718419 You stole our glowpaz!
718000 [ponies shouting]
71814e I should have known you were just trying to sully my name so that you'd be free to steal whatever you wanted.
718202 Of course that was the plan, Daring Do! At first I just wanted the glowpaz, but then I saw an opportunity to write you out of the story for good! [laughing evilly]
718000 [ponies gasping]
718202 And with the destruction you leave in your wake, it didn't take too much to convince ponies you were a villain!
71814e You're wrong, Caballeron. And I won't let you break my spirit again. Because I'm never going to give up hope that I can protect ponies and ancient treasures from miscreants like you!
718000 [ponies shouting in agreement]
718202 R-Remember! She ruined your statue! You're fools to believe in her! [growls] You'll pay for this, Daring Do!
718000 [ponies cheering]
71814e Okay, okay, that's enough. [to Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie] Thanks for helping me come to my senses. You two are true friends.
71800c Are you kidding? That... was... awesome!
718007 We're just glad you're back to your old self again.
71814e [chuckles] Me too. But I'm glad I realized that even if you're fighting for something good, you're still responsible for your actions.
71800c And if something bad happens that you didn't intend, you shouldn't give up hope or lose faith in yourself.
718007 Yeah! All you gotta do is make it right. Feel free to use that in your next book!
71814e You know, I think I will.
718030 [squealing and laughing]
718000 [Egyptian-style music]
718000 [ponies cheering]
718000 [credits]
719000 [ponies chattering]
719000 [flowers rustling]
719136 Hmph! Looks like I'm not the only one who left Mares Day to the last minute.
719027 There's just so many! How can I choose?!
719000 [angry crowd chattering]
71902f Now, hang on, everypony! We'll help all of you!
719027 How?!
71900d What I would do...
719000 [crowd gasps]
71900d ...is pick flowers that accentuate my mane. It makes for a captivating color story when you present them to whomever they're intended.
719000 [boop]
719000 [flowers rustling]
71902e That's it!
71902f Color consultations was a great idea, Rarity! Now, what can we do for you?
71900d Oh, darling, I need a dozen lavender pieces for Photo Finish's shoot on the most beautiful manes in Equestria.
719000 [beat]
71900d I know you're swamped, but it's for Vanity Mare! She's going to take pictures of my mane, so color coordination is a must.
71902f Anything for you, Rarity.
719000 [fans blowing]
71900d Have you a single big one? If the wind came from one direction, it would really intensify the effect.
71941a I don't. Uh, but I could make you one! It's not like I've got anything else to do.
719000 [door opens]
719000 [whistle]
71900d Hmm. I do enjoy the windswept look, but other ponies might need to see it before they feel it.
719000 [switch clicks]
719000 [door opens]
719000 [ponies aah-ing]
71900d My mane will be flowing over the chaise in the tableau I have in mind. But I was hoping to choose the color. Could you make one in a pale yellow? I need something across the color wheel from this. [giggles]
71941b Oh, if these came in different colors, I'd buy one for every room.
7190c4 Hmm... Sales have been down. More colors it is!
719000 [bits clinking]
719000 [bell rings]
71900d Pinkie? I need to put Photo Finish in a good mood, and nothing creates a better mood than your confecti— Ooh. Am I interrupting?
719007 We were just celebrating the anniversary of the twins' first sneezes! [giggles] [clears throat]
719007 Just about one year ago
719007 There was a tickle in your nose
719007 You snorted through the nursery
719000 [snorts]
719000 Happy Sneeze-iversary!
719000 Achoo! Achoo! Aaaaa-choo!
719000 [can squirting]
71900d [deadpan] Congratulations.
71913c [blow on candles]
719000 [theme song]
719000 [stretching]
719000 [snap!]
71900d [shrieks] Pinkie! I can't have Photo Finish shoot my mane like this! And this party string won't come off!
719007 Oh, that's because it's not just party string. It's super-sticky celebration string!
71900d [low growl]
719007 Sorry. I guess my sneeze-versary was a little too sneeze-abratory. [giggles nervously]
71900d [shuddering sigh] It'll be fine, Pinkie. I'll find a way to clean this up before the shoot tomorrow. [whimper] Actually, you might consider doing the same.
719000 [stretching]
719007 [grunting, straining] If only we had some kind of super-sudsy mane conditioning shampoo for you and a magical cleaning remover potion for me.
71900d [gasps] That's it! We'll pay a visit to Zecora! She's a wonder with a cauldron. I'm sure she can mix up a fix for both of us.
719007 [straining]
719000 [splat]
719007 That's good, because it would take forever to yank all of those baked goods out of the super-sticky celebration string.
71900d I... think you may still have some baking to do.
719000 [eerie music]
71900d I do wish Zecora lived in town. One shouldn't have to brave the darkest part of the forest for shampoo.
719007 Do you think Photo Finish would want to take a picture of my mane?
719000 [bird flapping]
71900d Well, uh... Hmm...I'm not sure that your style is quite right for this particular photo essay. Photo Finish travelled everywhere in her search for the most beautiful of manes.
719007 [shaking]
719000 [poink!]
71941c [yelp]
719007 Even Yakyakistan?
71900d Well, yaks don't have manes, per se, and I'm not sure their style is quite what she's looking for either.
719000 [splash]
71900d Though at this moment, neither is mine.
719007 Don't worry! Zecora will abso-tively be able to help!
71900d I'm sure you're right.
719000 [beat]
71900d Listen, spooky eyes! Why don't you take a picture?! It will last longer!
719000 [creatures squeaking]
71900d On second thought, don't. Getting my picture taken in this state is what I'm trying to avoid!
71900d Are you certain that's safe?
719047 I'm sure they seem strange, but my methods are mine. After all, I've been doing this for quite a long time.
719007 I'll have those cupcakes cleaned off in no time!
71900d You really should bake new ones.
719007 Nah!
719047 For your mane, of course, just soap will do, so use my super-sudsy shampoo.
71900d Oh-ho, what a relief! I can't tell you how worried I was that my mane wouldn't be ready for the shoot. [laughs]
719047 You were right to be concerned. Manes are tricky, I have learned.
71900d Oh! [scoffs] Tell me about it!
719047 Cleaning is simple, but a magical fix could cause any number of troublesome ticks.
719007 Really?
719047 Oh, there are tales I could tell to make your hair stand on end. Horrifying, terrifying attempts to mane-mend!
71900d Well, I do enjoy a good yarn, but I'm not sure I could take anymore mane fright today.
719007 Well, I love a good scary story! [giggles]
719047 There's the contagious frizz that spreads friend to friend, or the story of the infinitely splitting end!
71900d [screams]
719000 [clatter]
71900d Uh-huh, hmm, yes, well, very entertaining. Uh, thanks for the shampoo. Ta-ta!
719007 Anything about curls that keep on curling until your whole body is one big curl?
719047 [laughs] There is one story I nearly forgot - of an Earth pony who needed to clean up her shop.
719007 Wow! That's just what I have to do! Huh, weird.
719047 Perhaps it'd be better if I were more clear. You can't clean up Sugarcube Corner from here.
719007 Geez, Zecora, I can take a hint.
719047 With just a few drops, any mess you'll improve if you focus on that which you want to remove.
719007 It won't be hard to focus on the super-sticky celebration string. It's kinda the only thing you can see.
719007 Zecora says it would only take a few drops, but I figured we should all chip in. Just in case! Remember to only focus on the party string. We don't wanna accidentally remove anything else.
71913c [babbling]
719007 Ooh! Sudsy! [giggles]
71900d [humming] A relaxing shower really gives you the chance to focus on the fabulosity of your mane! [laughs, sniff sniff] Not the most pleasant scent, but it gets the job done. [humming] My mane feels lighter alrea— [screams]
719047 [sipping]
719000 [door opens]
719047 [spits]
71900d It's important that you know that I am not pointing hooves, but—
719047 I don't understand. Is that you, Rarity? Why would you think to point your hooves at me?
71900d Let's just say I understand why your shampoo hasn't made a splash in the marketplace.
719000 [cloak rustling]
71900d Goodness, Zecora! You could at least pretend it isn't that bad!
719047 I'm sorry, my dear, but there is nothing to say. You just took the wrong potion from here yesterday.
71900d Oh, thank goodness! I thought maybe your shampoo had triggered early-onset mare pattern baldness!
719047 No, this lack of hair was put into motion when you mistakenly washed with remover potion.
71900d [laughing] Oh, what a relief! Well, if you could just whip up a cure, I'll be on my way. So much to do before the shoot tomorrow.
719047 As I mentioned before, there's no easy fix. Mane-mending magic's the trickiest of tricks.
71900d [mumbling] Sorry?
719047 I doubt that your mane has left us forever. There is a chance we can fix it, I think, if we're clever.
71900d W-w-w-w-w-w-wait, there's, there's a chance?! You think?!
719047 I need to focus if I'm to work any faster. One wrong ingredient spells utter disaster. You should go finish your list of to-dos. Keep your mind off of all of these mane-losing blues.
719000 [ponies chattering]
71900d [exhales] There's nothing to worry about. Zecora will have a cure before I've even finished my to-dos. But I don't know if I can even show my face looking like this!
719059 [gasps]
719246 [crying]
71902f I'm sorry, miss, but I can't match your mane if I can't see it.
71903a What about mine?
71902f Marigold, I should think!
71900d Uh, sorry. I, uh, believe it was my turn, and I-I-I-I just need to pick up some—
719000 [flowers rustling]
71903a Perfect!
719033 Now me!
719000 [squeak]
71941d It's wonderful how this display shows that your fans provide just the right amount of air!
71941a Well, I owe it all to Rarity.
71900d Oh, so kind of you to say. I-I—
71941a Kindness has nothing to do with it! Rarity always knows how to make something look its best. Probably because she looks so good herself! That ain't something us non-fabulous folk here can understand.
71900d N-Non-fabulous?!
719000 [customers agreeing]
719000 [ponies muttering]
7190c4 Now I appreciate everypony's interest in our new sofa colors, but the yellow one is spoken for.
71900d Oh, thank you, Davenport. Um, perhaps I can pick it up once everypony leav—
719064 I'll give you twice whatever the pony who wants to buy the yellow one is paying!
719218 Three times!
71900d But— But— I— I—
7190c4 Sold!
719000 [ripping noise]
719000 [crowd gasps]
71900d [worried shriek]
71900d I can't believe how differently ponies treat you when you can't command their attention.
719003 Are you sure that's what happened?
71927c Wait. You can't command ponies' attention because your mane's messed up?
71900d "Messed up"? Does this look "messed up" to you?!
719314 [gasps]
71900d Honestly! How hard is it to pretend it's not so bad?
71927c Hard.
71900d If today is any indication of how ponies will treat me from now on, I can't simply wait to see if my mane grows back!
719003 I'm sorry, Rarity. I'm sure nopony means to make you feel worse than you already do.
71927c Didn't you say Zecora was working on a cure?
71900d Yes, well, even if everypony isn't utterly indifferent to my presence, Zecora might not be able to fix this in time for the shoot. Can't you do a spell to restore some semblance of my mane?!
71927c The thing is, it's pretty much like Zecora said. Fixing manes with magic is—
71900d Tricky! I know! I don't care! Make with the tricks!
71927c Huh?
719003 [sighs]
719000 [magic zap]
71941e [screams]
719000 [shattering]
719000 [magic zap]
719000 [bird pecking]
71900d This won't do! I need an actual mane!
71927c But it has to come from somewhere.
719003 Oh, you can't just make a mane with magic. The results could be disastrous.
71900d More disastrous than this?!
719000 [thump]
719000 [magic zaps]
719000 [flapping noise]
719000 [scissors snipping]
719003 [sighs] I don't think there's anything else we can try.
71900d [panicked stuttering] B-But Zecora said there was still a chance!
719000 [door opens]
719047 At last, Rarity, I have searched for so long! What I told you before was totally wrong!
719003 Zecora, you found a cure? That's amazing!
71900d [sighs in relief] You mean I'll get my fabulous mane back in time for the shoot?
719047 Oh, no. I'm afraid I can't fix it before the big shoot. But in time, the hair will grow back from the root. There's no magical cure to hasten us through it, unless you went backward in time to undo it.
71927c Uh-uh. I think we can both say that's not a good option.
71900d [groans, bawling]
71900d I have always believed that the right outfit can make up for any other areas that are lacking. But I will need your honest opinions. [nervous ta-da] How awful is it?
719046 [simultaneously] Uhhh...
71906a [yowls]
71900d Oh, come on! Can't anypony pretend it's not bad?!
71900e We could, um, try.
71900c Maybe...?
71900d Well, if any of you have an idea how to make this disaster look good enough for Photo Finish's piece in Vanity Mare on the most beautiful manes in Equestria, [sobbing] I'm open to hearing it!
719008 Is that all?
71900c No problem!
71900d Hm?
719000 [Bessie being milked]
71900d I don't understand, Applejack. How is milking a cow going to help?
719008 That's just it. It looks like we hired a new milkmaid...
719009 This is pretty close to my color as a young'un!
719008 Just a little down-home ingenuity.
71900d It's a good idea, Applejack, but Photo Finish is looking for the most beautiful manes, not bonnets.
719000 [thip]
719008 [laughs nervously]
71900c This'll do the trick. Just you wait!
719000 [spinning noises]
71900d [gasps] You know, this is really quite fetching!
71900c Yes! Nailed it!
719000 [poof]
71900d ...Just not portable.
71900c [groans]
7192f9 [growling]
719000 [squirrel chittering]
71900e There!
71900d Oh, let's face it. I'll just have to call Photo Finish and cancel.
719003 I think we all know how bad Rarity's been feeling, but I never thought she'd cancel her shoot with Photo Finish.
71900c You saw her mane, right?
719008 But it's Rarity. If anypony can turn lemons into lemonade, it's her.
71900e I guess it's harder for her when she feels like the lemon.
719003 Well, she's not a lemon – she's our friend. And right now, she needs our support.
719000 [knocking]
71900d [muffled] Come in.
719000 [bell rings]
71900d Would you mind closing the door? I'm more comfortable in the dark.
719000 [click]
719008 Okay, Rarity, you've done just about enough sulkin'! Havin' a fabulous mane is a wonderful thing, but it ain't the only thing!
71900c Yeah! And we're here to remind you how awesome you are, mane or no mane!
71900d [sighs] It's lovely of you to say, but it's hard to argue with cold, hard facts.
71900e What facts are those?
71900d That without my mane, I simply can't shine as I once did, and ponies treat me like the sad, invisible pony I've become.
719003 Rarity, you're not invisible. You're our friend. A friend that started a fashion empire.
71900e A friend who made us all feel beautiful in her lovely creations.
71900c A friend who stuck by us, no matter what!
719008 A friend so generous that she once chopped off her own tail to help a sea serpent.
719003 I know you lost some confidence when you lost your mane, but unlike your hair, confidence is something you can get back right now.
71900d Goodness... You're right! The only pony behaving differently today was me! Besides, what doesn't shine from the outside in...
71927c Um, Rarity, what are you doing?
71900d I'm preparing to shine from the inside out!
719000 [guitar twang]
71941f [gasps]
71900c Awesome!
719000 [flowers rustling]
719136 It's my own fault. I shouldn't have bought flowers without asking Spoiled what she likes.
71902f Well, we don't have much left. What does she like?
719136 Um, uh... purple?
71900d I have a solution!
719000 [guitar twang]
71902f Rarity, that mane is...
719420 Amazing!
71900d Thank you. Although I'm afraid I missed my chance at Vanity Mare, which means I have quite a few lavender arrangements to spare.
719136 Uh, is lavender purple?
719000 [flowers rustling]
719000 [fans blowing]
71900d Mm... The windswept look is very last-season. Perhaps you could set this up outside. It's sure to draw in the hoof traffic.
719000 [fan blowing]
719262 Ahhh!
719000 [crowd chattering]
719000 [bits clinking]
71900d Photoshoot or no, you can always use a chaise!
719008 Well, Rarity, if you wanted to shine from the inside out, I think this afternoon, you became the brightest filly in Equestria!
71900d Oh, pshaw, Applejack. I'm simply making up for all the time I wasted feeling sorry for myself.
71900c I don't know why you were so upset. Your mane looks awesome!
71900d I'm just glad I have all of you to remind me that even if I accidentally use magical remover potion on my mane, I can look good on the outside as long as I feel good on the inside.
719003 How'd you end up using remover potion on your head, anyway?
71900d [gasps] Pinkie!
71900d If I had the remover potion this whole time, that means Pinkie must have the—
719000 [door opens]
719000 [flooding noise]
719007 Wheeeeeeee! [giggling]
71900d ...shampoo.
719007 Shampoo? Wow! That explains why our manes are all so bouncy and soft!
719000 [guitar twang]
71900d Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the rest of that remover potion.
719007 Great! Hey, is there something different about you? New hoof polish?
71900d So you're sure? You're sure it's fully recovered?
719008 Yes, Rarity. It's been months. Your mane looks fine.
719007 Oooh, look! It's the "Most Beautiful Manes in Equestria" issue of Vanity Mare! You should read it.
71900d Oh, honestly, Pinkie? After all I went through, I'm not sure it even matters what mane graces the page—
719000 [whap]
719007 Read it!
71900d But I... I cancelled the shoot.
719008 We had a little talk with Photo Finish.
71900e And explained just how beautiful we thought you were. Inside and out.
719000 [pages flicking]
71900c While you were shining from the inside out, Photo Finish took a few pictures.
71900d I don't know what to say!
719008 Luckily, you don't have to say anything. Your style speaks for itself.
719012 [encouraging noises]
719000 [credits]
72000e Thank you so much, Zecora. I never would've found the crisscross moss without you.
720047 Of course. I know where it grows, so it's not much to ask. Though retrieving it has been a difficult task.
72000e Oh, but the oxen visiting Sweet Feather Sanctuary next week will surely appreciate it. It really adds a shine to their coat.
720000 [splut]
720047 There we go. Now, that wasn't so tough. Fluttershy, tell me, will this be enough?
72000e Gee, I don't know. It's a pretty big pack. So maybe enough to fill up this sack? [gasps, laughs] Oh, my! You're rubbing off on me, Zecora!
720047 Whoa. Whoa!
720000 [branch snaps]
720000 [splash]
72000e [screams] Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!
720047 [gasps]
72000e Zecora, are you all right?
720047 No need to fret. I only got wet. At least now I can easily grab all the crisscross moss there is to be had.
720000 [poof]
72000e [gasps] What's happening to you?
720047 Honestly, it's hard to tell. But suddenly, I don't feel so well...
72000e [gasps deeply]
720000 [theme song]
72012a All right, Zecora. Let's have a listen to the old ticker.
720000 [jazz drum solo]
72012a Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.
72000e Do you think it's serious, doctor?
72012a Well, that wasn't a good sign.
72000e I can't believe a flower did this. I take back thinking it was pretty!
720047 [coughing]
72012a Mm-hmm. We're looking for any color other than red.
72000e Phew. [gasps loudly]
72012a Oh, it's just as I thought. I'm afraid you have a very rare disease called... [echoing] Swamp Fever!
720000 [thunder and lightning]
720047 Tell me, doctor. What should I do? I've never heard of Swamp Fever, mind you.
72012a Unfortunately, very little is known about the disease. Except, of course, its symptoms – change of coat, coughing bubbles, shock sneezing, confusion, and the last stage, the afflicted turn into the very trees that drop the disease-spreading flower.
720047 Oh! Is there anything that can be done for such a terrible conundrum?!
72012a A cure has yet to be discovered. I'm sorry, Zecora.
720047 Hmmm.
72012a It's a lot to take in. I'll leave you two to discuss.
720000 [door closes]
72000e Zecora, this is all my fault! If you hadn't been helping me get the crisscross moss, you wouldn't have gotten Swamp Fever. I'm so sorry.
720047 Fluttershy, you are not to blame. These things happen all the same.
72000e I refuse to accept that! There has to be somepony who can help you!
720047 Oh. There's a healer of legend who never would fail. But I only know her from ancient folktales. Mystical and masked, she came in the night and cured everything from hoof cough to fur blight. What became of the healer, nopony knows, for she disappeared ages and ages ago.
72000e The Mystical Mask! Of course! My parents would tell me about her whenever I was sick in bed.
720047 There's so many accounts of her power to heal. She can't just be a legend. I think she's real.
72000e If that's who we need to cure you, then I'm going to find her! And I know just the pony who can help!
72000e [pants] Oh.
720000 [door opens]
72000e Twilight? Twilight? Twilight! Oh, I'm so sorry to bother— Are... Are you cooking?
720003 Yeah! Spike and I are having a cook-off!
720005 My cauliflower bites blew her sweet potato muffins out of the water!
720003 I'm glad you're here, Fluttershy, because we're gonna need a second opinion about that.
72000e [grunts, gulps, grunts, gulps] Um, they're both delicious, but... [quickly] Zecora-has-Swamp-Fever-and-there's-no-cure-and-it's-all-my-fault-and-the-only-pony-who-can-cure-it-is-the-Mystical-Mask-and-I-need-your-help-to-find-her!
720003 Uh...
720005 So, what'd she pick? The cauliflower bites, right?
720000 [pages flipping]
720003 [sighs] That's the last book on ancient ponies, and still no mention of the Mystical Mask.
72000e Hmm. Did we check the unabridged versions?
720003 Yes, and the books on rare diseases, the books on rare plants, and the entire section on bog habitation.
72000e Well, we might have to look through every book in the entire library, but I know we'll figure it out.
720003 Oh.
720000 [music]
72000e [sighs] Another dead end. Have you found anything yet, Twilight?
720003 [snoring]
72000e Twilight?
720003 Aah!
720000 [thud]
72000e Goodness! Are you okay?
720003 [sighs] I'm fine. Fluttershy, you know that I want to help Zecora. But I think we'd be a lot better off if we got some sleep. We've been at this for hours.
72000e Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
720003 No problem. I'll grab you a pillow and—
72000e Oh, no-no-no. I meant you should sleep. I can't rest until Zecora is healed.
720003 I understand how you feel, but I still think we'd have more luck if we tried again in the morning. Just promise me you'll take a break soon.
72000e [not listening] Mm-hmm.
720003 [yawns] Good night, Fluttershy.
720000 [door closes]
720003 [snoring] 9-by-13-inch pan...
720000 [thud!]
72000e Twilight!
720003 [awake] Nonstick pans!
720005 [groans] What's all the commotion in here, ladies?
72000e Sorry, but I figured out who the Mystical Mask is!
720003 [gasps] You did?!
72000e All I had to do was cross-reference a book about masks with another book on ancient Equestrian healers, then use a third book to translate it all from Olde Ponish, and there it was! Zecora was right! The Mystical Mask wasn't just a legend. The Mystical Mask was Mage Meadowbrook!
720003 [gasps deeply] The ancient sorceress from Hayseed Swamp? We studied her at Celestia's school! Are you sure?
72000e Absolutely! Mage Meadowbrook wasn't just a sorceress. She was also a healer, and back then, healers wore masks so they wouldn't get sick themselves!
720003 Fluttershy, I am so incredibly proud of you for using your research skills to figure this out! But Meadowbrook lived ages ago, and didn't she disappear?
72000e Mm-hmm. But if we go to Hayseed Swamp, maybe we can find something she left behind! Something that could lead to a cure!
720003 It seems like a long shot, but I guess it's possible.
720000 [pyow!]
72000e [grunting] We have to try! I've got a route all planned out, and on the way, we can check up on Zecora, and then—
720003 Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're leaving now?
72000e Of course! Every second we spend waiting is a second Zecora is coughing bubbles!
720003 But Fluttershy, you haven't slept! And that's a long journey!
72000e There's no use trying to talk me out of this, Twilight! [grunts] We've got no time to waste!
720003 Can we at least grab some breakfast?
72000e I packed cauliflower bites.
720003 Aw. No sweet potato muffins?
720005 I, uh, ate them all. They were actually really good. [chuckles]
72000e And that's when I realized the Mystical Mask was actually Mage Meadowbrook!
720047 [coughs] That's marvelous, Fluttershy. I am quite impressed. While you are gone on your journey, I'll try not to be... worried.
72000e [gasps] Oh, no. Zecora, you didn't rhyme! You must be getting worse.
720047 Oh. No, no, no, not at all. Something... something... ball? [sneezes]
720000 [electricity crackles]
72000e [gasps] That's it! We have to go now!
720003 Lead the way, Fluttershy.
720000 [thud]
720000 [circling birdies]
72000e [groans]
720000 [door opens]
720000 [door closes]
720000 [thump]
720000 [music]
720003 So... [chuckles nervously] where do you think Meadowbrook lived?
72000e [yawns] I'm not sure. Maybe there's somepony we can ask.
720003 I think we might be the only ponies here.
720000 [beat]
72000e Wait! I recognize that tree! [gasps] Yes! This has to be it! It's just like the illustrations of her home!
720003 Anypony who lives in a tree is okay by me.
72000e [grunts] Phew. Well, if the doorway is sealed up, we'll just have to dig our way in. Back up, Twilight! I don't want you to get hurt! [grunting]
720003 Or we could try the handle.
72000e [laughs nervously] It really blends in with the bark.
720003 Easy to miss.
720000 [door opens]
72000e Wow. It looks like this place has been abandoned for years. [gasps] Twilight, look! It's the same kind of lilypad that gave Zecora Swamp Fever! Hmm. I wonder if Meadowbrook was looking for a cure for Swamp Fever, too. [gasps] Do you think she found it?
720003 I hope so, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
720000 [loud squeak]
720003 That's exactly what I'm talking about. You're making your excited squeaking noise!
72000e Uh, I wasn't making my excited squeaking noise.
720000 [loud squeak]
720084 [scream]
720421 [Cajun accent] Y'all can stop screamin' now. Didn't mean to scare ya. I do that a lot.
720003 Scare ponies or rock creepily in the dark?
720421 Well, both, I s'pose. Name's Cattail. Pleased to meet ya.
72000e Likewise, but, um, may I ask, why are you in Mage Meadowbrook's home?
720421 Oh, I take care of the place. I ain't much of a cleaner, but from what I hear, my kin wasn't neither. So I doubt they'd mind a few cobwebs in our ancestral home.
72000e [gasps] You're related to Mage Meadowbrook?
720421 Mm-hmm.
72000e Oh, my goodness, Twilight, we did it! Not only did we find Mage Meadowbrook's old house – we actually found one of her descendants!
720003 Honestly, I would not have guessed it.
720421 So you're lookin' for some kind o' cure, huh? Well, now, I know Meadowbrook was known to always be writin' in her journals. If she had the cure you want, I reckon that's where it'd be. Come on. I'll show ya the library.
720003 Library?! Now we're talkin'!
720000 [beat]
720003 Oh. Well... [chuckles] Libraries come in all shapes and sizes.
72000e This is good. It'll take us less time to go through everything.
720000 [thud]
72000e [blows air, reading] "Today, my mom made me eat peas. Peas are yucky." And we can probably skip this one, unless she found a cure when she was a foal.
720003 [reading] "I met a colt today. He pulled my mane, so I put a frog on his head." Also not helpful, but I do kinda want to see where it goes. [grumbles]
72000e Wait! Listen to this! [reading] "Today, I tried again to brew an unsniffle elixir..."
720422 [crossfading] [Cajun accent] ...and I finally got it right!
720424 [sneezing]
720000 [sipping noise]
720424 [sighs]
720425 Meadowbrook, I think it's time you had this.
720000 [thumping]
720423 [gasps] My very own healer's mask! You think I'm ready, mother?
720425 Mm-hm.
720000 [knocking]
720000 [door opens]
720425 [gasps] What caused this?
720423 [narrating] Mother calls it Swamp Fever. We've been tryin' to find a cure, but it hasn't been easy.
720000 [lily puffs]
720425 [coughing]
720000 [knocking]
720000 [door opens]
720426 [coughs]
720423 [narrating] The fever spread like wildfire.
720000 [ponies sneezing and coughing]
720425 [coughing]
720423 [narrating] I fear if we don't find a cure soon, everypony will be in grave danger!
720425 [coughing]
720423 [narrating] With mother sick, I didn't think I'd ever find a cure. But starin' at those cursed flowers today, I saw somethin'.
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
720000 [lilies puffing]
720423 [gasps] Flash bees! [narrating] I realized the flowers' poison didn't affect the flash bees. And if they were immune to Swamp Fever, their honey could be the cure!
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
720000 [branch snaps]
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
720000 [zaps]
720423 [narrating] But they were so aggressive defendin' their hive, I didn't know how I was gonna get it!
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
720423 Here goes nothin'!
720423 [narrating] Today, I cured mother...
720422 [crossfading] ...and the rest of the bayou!
72000e [reading] "It was the greatest feeling I've ever experienced, and I promise to dedicate my life to curing ponies all over Equestria!"
720421 And she did just that. Right up 'til she disappeared without a trace.
72000e So all we have to do is find those aggressive flash bees and get them to give us their honey! Of course, it doesn't say how she did that...
720000 [beat]
72000e What? Is my mane messy? I know I haven't slept in a while, but... [gasps] Oh, no! I've caught Swamp Fever!
72000e Huh?
720000 [thump, thump]
720003 [slightly muffled] Are you sure these are necessary?
72000e What?
720003 I said, are you sure these are necessary?
72000e Yes! I won't risk infecting you or Cattail!
720003 What you can't risk is getting any sicker! If you don't rest, your symptoms will only get worse!
72000e [coughs]
720421 Mm-hmm. You really should rest up before going up against those flash bees. They are nasty critters.
72000e Um, you don't know this about me, but I'm pretty good with animals. And besides, Dogtail—
720421 Cattail.
72000e Um, Zecora is counting on me. I have to help her, just like Meadowbrook helped her mother and all those bayou ponies long ago!
720003 But Fluttershy, as much as Meadowbrook took care of other ponies, I'm sure she also took care of herself.
72000e [strained] You're not gonna change my mind, Twilight!
720421 Ooh. For bein' sick, she sure is strong.
720421 The flash beehive is just up yonder.
720003 Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
72000e No! It's too dangerous, Twilight. Besides, I've already gotten one friend hurt. I won't let it happen to another. [exhales] Okay, Fluttershy, you can do this! [coughs]
72000e [panting] [straining] Mind over matter! [grunts] [straining, panting]
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
72000e Hello, flash bees! I was hoping I could get some of your honey.
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
72000e Oh! I see. You don't let others have any. Well, I'm sorry, but I really need it.
720000 [zap]
72000e [squeaks] I didn't want it to have to come to this, but I'll just have to use... the Stare!
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
720000 [zap, zap, zap]
72000e [shrieks] [coughs] You really are aggressive! [coughs] Oh, dear. [whimpers]
72000e [groans] What happened? Where am I?
720003 [exhales] I'm so glad you're okay. You're still in Meadowbrook's tree.
720421 You fainted, but Twilight shot some magic up and caught ya. It was crazy.
72000e Goodness gracious! [coughs] Have you heard from Zecora? Is she okay?
720003 Uh...
720421 We got word your zebra friend has started sproutin' leaves.
72000e She's already turning into a tree?! I thought we'd have more time!
720003 Actually, you've been asleep for three days.
72000e Three days?!
720003 Mm-hmm. You were asleep so long, we were afraid you wouldn't be able to move when you woke up. But thankfully, you just wore yourself down!
72000e Oh, dear. We have to get back to the hive! I've wasted so much time, and—!
720421 Now hang on there, Fluttershy. Those flash bee critters are tricky.
720003 Cattail's right. I can't even use magic to calm them down. We'll have to find another way to get the honey.
720421 We've tried everything from disguises to things I won't even speak of. [shudders]
720003 He's been through a lot these past three days.
72000e Wait... Disguises...
720000 [flash bee buzzing]
72000e [gasps] That's it! I know how she did it! I know how Meadowbrook got the honey!
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
72000e This is how Meadowbrook got the honey from the flash bees!
720421 She threw a mask at 'em? I wouldn't recommend that.
72000e No. The male bees aren't aggressive around the queen bee, and this mask has the same stripes that she does.
720003 Fluttershy, that's brilliant!
72000e [sneezes]
720000 [zap]
720421 Whoa!
72000e There's no time to waste!
720003 Hooves crossed!
720421 Oh, golly! I can't watch!
72000e [coughs] Mind over matter!
720000 [flash bees buzzing]
72000e [buzzing]
720000 [splat]
72000e Twilight... It's working!
720047 [gulps]
720000 [leaves rustling]
720003 I think she's cured now, Fluttershy.
720047 Ohhh, I do feel fine, and this honey is divine.
72000e Oh, you're rhyming again! Welcome back, my friend!
720047 Thank you, Fluttershy, for all you endured. If not for you, I would not be cured.
72000e Oh, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have been sick in the first place.
720047 Regret is not what you should feel, because on this journey, you've learned a great deal.
72000e That's true. I certainly learned that if you don't take care of yourself, you won't be able to take care of anypony else. In fact, if I had rested like Twilight had suggested all along, maybe I would have thought to use Meadowbrook's mask sooner.
720000 [window squeaking]
72012a [coughing]
720000 [bubbles popping]
72012a Please tell me you found the cure! [sneezes, sneezes]
720000 [credits]
72100a Okay! let's see how your still life's comin' along, Kettle Corn!
721000 [beat]
721066 Well, that certainly is... round.
721427 I can make it rounder!
72100a I'm afraid that's all the time we have today. We'll try somethin' else tomorrow.
721427 But I like circle painting.
721065 And on the way to figuring out what you're meant to do, you'll find a ton more stuff you like. That's what makes looking for your cutie mark so great.
721081 Mm-hmm.
721000 [door opens]
72100a Sorry, everypony. We're closin' up shop. We'll have to help you out tomorrow.
7210f3 Awwww!
721000 [door closes]
721065 I don't know if we can help them tomorrow. Working with blank flanks one at a time takes forever.
72100a If only there was a way we could help a whole herd of them at once.
721066 That would be perfect! We'd save time and they could help each other!
721065 Just like we used to! Oh, but it'd have to be somewhere big enough to handle all those blank flanks.
721066 Somewhere outside, with tons of activities to try.
72100a Are you two thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
721080 Cutie Mark Day Camp!
72100a And I know just the place, Applejack used to go there when she was little.
721065 Camp Friendship! Oh. Sorry. I thought we were all gonna yell that one too.
721080 [laughing]
721000 [theme song]
72100a Attention, all blank flanks!
721065 And blank flank affiliates! Come to our cutie mark day camp to find out what you're truly good at!
721066 Bond with other blank flanks and find out what you're meant to do together!
721000 [ponies chattering]
721065 Hey, Rumble!
721180 Oh, hey, Crusaders. Look, I can't stop. I've gotta meet my brother for... something.
72100a No problem. Just wanted to make sure you heard about our cutie mark day camp. The first session's tomorrow.
721000 [paper being scrunched]
72117a What'cha got there, little brother?
721180 What? Oh, nothing. Come on! I want to show you a new dive roll I'm trying.
721000 [whoosh]
721000 [paper being uncrumpled]
721065 Come one, come all! Cutie Mark Day Camp is for blank flanks of all kinds!
72117a Hmmm...
721000 [foals laughing and chattering]
72100a Welcome, cutie mark campers!
721066 Who's excited to be here?
7210f3 We are! [dissolves into excited chatter]
721066 Well, we're excited too! At Cutie Mark Day Camp, you'll be able to try all kinds of things!
72100a Kayaking!
721065 Horseshoe-tossing!
721427 Circle-painting!
72100a You can try 'em all! But the most important thing is that you'll be tryin' them together.
721065 That's what worked for us!
72117a Then I bet it'll work for these little guys too!
721000 [foals gasping]
721000 [ding]
721180 I thought you said we were gonna go practice for the Wonderbolts Ponyville Extravaganza show.
72117a I'm going to Wonderbolt practice. You're going to cutie mark practice.
721066 And we're glad to have you!
721000 [foals making awed noises]
721428 I can't believe your own brother is a Wonderbolt!
721000 [more foal chatter]
721065 U-Uh, Rainbow Dash is practically my sister, and she's a Wonderbolt too!
721000 [beat]
721000 [foals laughing]
7210f2 Do you know Spitfire?
72117a I know she'll be mad if I'm late. [to Rumble] Now you have a good time and try some stuff. Who knows what you'll be good at?
721000 [horseshoe clinking]
721000 [foals wowing]
72100a All right! Looks like we found the first activity of the day – the horseshoe toss!
721000 [foals cheering]
72117a Well, wish I could stay and play, but it's time to fly. Have fun!
721000 [whooshing]
721000 [foals making awed noises]
721000 [horseshoe clinking]
721066 Come on, Rumble!
72100a Step on up and show us how it's done!
721427 No way he's as good as his brother.
721180 Egh.
721000 [clink]
721180 [unenthusiastic] Whoops. Aw, it looks like I won't be getting my cutie mark in the horseshoe toss...
721066 Don't worry about it, Rumble. Hardly anypony finds their calling on the first try.
721180 Eh, I wasn't worried.
721065 Good! 'Cause there's a ton of other stuff to try. We'll find you something you're good at.
721000 [foals cheering]
721180 [sighs]
721000 [montage music]
721000 [thump, splash]
721180 Whoops.
721000 [thunking]
721000 [twing]
721180 Whoopsie.
721000 [hooves thumping]
721000 [foals laughing]
721000 [thump]
721180 Whoops.
721000 [pencil scribbling]
721428 Skeedaddle:
721428 The first and last lines
721428 Have five sy-lla-bles but the
721428 Mid-ddle has sev-en.
721428 It's called a haiku.
721000 [scribbling]
721000 [pencil breaks]
721180 [spits]
721000 [unenthusiastic] Whoops. I've tried it all.
721000 Time to tell my brother this
721000 Camp isn't for me.
721065 Come on, Rumble. Isn't it fun just trying stuff?
721180 Not really.
721000 [shimmer]
721000 [foals cheering]
721427 Kettle Corn:
721427 Haiku cutie mark!
721427 And I never would have tried
721427 Without Skeedaddle.
72100a That's what Cutie Mark Day Camp is all about.
721066 Working together and helping each other.
721000 [foals cheering]
721427 But I can still come back, right? And maybe paint some circles?
721065 Of course! Let's all meet right back here tomorrow.
7210f3 Hooray!
721066 Wow. I can't believe we got a cutie mark on the first day!
72100a Yup. This camp was a pretty swell idea. Everypony's really enjoyed it.
721065 [sighs] Everypony except Rumble. He didn't have much luck with anything.
721066 Trying to find out what you're meant to do can be frustrating. You remember how long it took us to get our cutie marks?
72100a [shivers] I remember the nightmares.
721065 Well, we can't let Rumble quit camp just because he didn't find something he's good at then.
721066 We'll just have to convince him to come back and try harder!
721080 Mm-hmm!
721000 [whooshing]
721000 [Wonderbolts motif]
721065 Hey, Rumble!
721180 What are you all doing here?
721065 We just wanted to apologize for not finding anything you liked today.
721180 Oh. Whatever. It's fine.
72100a It's not fine. It's frustrating, and we know what it's like.
721180 I'm not frustrated!
721065 It's okay! We've all been there. But we won't give up on helping you.
721066 We know you'll get your cutie mark. Everypony does.
721180 Actually, I don't need your help. Because I don't want to get my cutie mark!
721080 What?!
72100a I... I must have hay in my ears, because I thought I just heard Rumble say—
721180 You heard right! I don't want my cutie mark!
721066 [gasps] He said it again!
721065 Not wanting a cutie mark is like not wanting to breathe!
721066 Everypony wants to know what they're meant to do!
721180 Hmph! Not this pony.
721080 Why?!
721180 Because cutie marks are silly, and... a-and they just force you into one thing your whole life!
721066 That's silly. Having a cutie mark doesn't mean you can't do other things.
72100a Yeah! Our cutie marks are in helpin' other ponies with their cutie marks, but I still like makin' potions with Zecora.
721180 And when was the last time you did that?
72100a Um... I-I-I think it was, uh... Well, we've been pretty busy helpin' other ponies lately.
721180 Oh. You mean doing the thing you got your cutie mark for? The thing you're stuck doing for the rest of your life?!
721066 Okay. Maybe we will be doing that more than anything else. But we love being Cutie Mark Crusaders!
721180 Well, that's fine for you, but I'm not gonna be put in a box!
721065 A blank flank who doesn't want a cutie mark? That's gotta be the strangest thing I've ever heard.
72100a Granny always says, "Some ponies have to find their own hay."
721065 Are you sure she didn't mean "find their own way"?
72100a Oh. That would make more sense.
721066 I can't believe Rumble isn't interested in getting his cutie mark either, but we can't force him.
721065 And we've got a whole camp full of ponies who are interested in getting cutie marks.
721080 Mm-hmm.
721000 [whoosh]
721180 [sighs] Here he comes. The fastest, most elite flyer in Equestria!
72117a Thunderlane!
721180 Whoa! [yelps] Urgh... I was gonna say me. You're not the only Pegasus in the family, you know.
72117a Oh, sorry, little brother. You're right. You might be the most elite flyer in Equestria some day. But for now, you should try other things, too! Speaking of which, aren't you supposed to be at camp?
721180 [scoffs] That camp is for losers who can't do anything.
72117a Great, so there's no pressure. You can try everything and not be worried about looking bad.
721180 I'm not worried about that. I just don't want to get a cutie mark in any of their ridiculous activities.
72117a Well, you're still going back tomorrow. You can't be a blank flank forever!
721180 Huh...
721000 [bell rings]
721066 All right, cutie mark campers, that's it for jam-making!
7210f2 But this is fun, and I didn't get my cutie mark yet. What if I'm not good at anything else?
721065 You don't get a cutie mark just because you're good at something or even because you like it. There's more to it than that.
721000 [splat]
721427 I'm real good at painting circles, but I got my cutie mark in haikus.
721428 Which is what I like! But... I'm still a blank flank like you.
7210f2 So you can't get a cutie mark in something you like?
72100a Now, we didn't say that.
721180 You don't have to!
721065 Rumble, you came back!
721180 Say bye-bye to painting circles. You'll be too busy haiku-ing from now on!
721427 But... I like circles.
72100a Come on, Rumble. That's not how cutie marks work.
7210f2 So that's how cutie marks work?
72100a Am I speakin' Olde Ponish?! I just said it wasn't!
721180 [Rumble]
721180 Cutie marks are great, they say
721180 Pfft, yeah, right!
721180 They make you special in your way
721180 But that special mark that's just for you
721180 Will erase the stuff you liiiiiiike... to do
721427 So, no more painting?
721428 No more haiku?
721066 Rumble, stop! That's just not true!
721180 [Rumble]
721180 So you're good at charming snakes
721180 Too bad!
721180 Or you bake delicious cakes
721180 Oh, well!
721180 Maybe there are lots of things
721180 That you like to do
721180 Well, your options get pretty stark
721180 Once you got that cutie mark
721180 Blank flanks are better
721180 Nopony to tell you who you have to be
721180 Blank flanks are better
721180 Keep your spirit soarin' free
721180 So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin'
721180 Don't need no mark, so why keep tryin'?
721180 If you like just bein' you
721180 Then keepin' that blank flank blank
721180 Is the thiiiiiiiing to do
721065 Cutie marks don't limit you.
72100a They only show you what you can do.
7210f2 But... what if you can't do a thing? These cutie marks are frustrating!
7210f3 [Foals]
7210f3 Blank flanks
7210f3 Blank flanks
7210f3 Blank flanks
7210f3 Blank flanks
721180 [Rumble]
721180 You say there's nothin' you can do?
7210f3 Yeah, exactly!
721180 [Rumble]
721180 A blank flank is the way for you
721180 It's no work to just be who you are
721180 No hunt to be some cutie star
721180 You're perfect just being you
721180 Don't bother with what you cannot do
721000 [Rumble and Foals]
721000 Blank flanks!
721180 [Rumble]
721180 ...are better
721180 Nopony to tell you who you have to be
721000 [Rumble and Foals]
721000 Blank flanks!
721180 [Rumble]
721180 ...are better
721180 Keep your spirit soarin' free
721180 So listen up 'cause I ain't lyin'
721000 [Rumble and Foals]
721000 Don't need no mark...
721180 [Rumble]
721180 ...so why keep tryin'?
721180 If you like just bein' you
721180 Then keepin' that blank flank blank
721180 Is the thiiiiiiiiiing to do!
721180 That's it, blank flanks! Be proud of who you are! You don't need some phony pony telling you you're just one thing! Blank flanks forever!
7210f3 [Foals]
7210f3 Blank flanks forever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever and ever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever and ever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever and ever!
721000 [Rumble and Foals]
721000 Blank flanks!
7210f2 Whoopee!
72100a Now wait just an apple-pickin' minute, Rumble. Where do you think you're leadin' our campers?
721180 They're not your campers anymore! I'm starting a new camp!
721000 [digging noise]
721180 Everypony on this side of the line is in Camp Blank Flanks Forever!
721000 [foals cheering]
721065 Whoa-whoa! You can't be a blank flank forever!
721000 [foals gasping]
721180 That's just the kind of talk I'd expect to hear from Camp Cutie Mark! Which is why blank flanks need a camp where we can enjoy being blank flanks and appreciate our blank flankiness without being pressured to get a cutie mark!
721000 [foals cheering]
721065 Now hold on, everypony.
721180 Blank flanks forever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever! [cheering]
721066 What just happened?
721065 Has everypony gone mad?!
72100a In a word - yes.
721066 I just can't see what we did wrong. I thought everypony was having fun.
72100a They were until that Rumble came and made a mess of things. What are they doing now?
721065 It looks like whatever they want.
721066 Honestly, it's not all that different from what they were doing here.
72100a Then what was the point?
721065 Point is that Rumble is a madpony who must be stopped!
721066 Now calm down, Crusaders. We just need to talk to him again. The key is to remain calm.
721066 [yelling] Cutie marks... make you... special!
721180 By putting you in a special little box!
721066 [yelling] Special!
721180 Box!
72100a Come on, Sweetie Belle. I think you've "remained calm" long enough.
721000 [foals chattering]
721066 Kettle Corn, you covered your cutie mark?!
721427 Kettle Corn:
721427 I'm blank flank again,
721427 Keeping my options open.
721427 I'm more than haikus.
721066 You just haiku'd right then!
721180 Don't let them get in your head! You're an open-ended question! Blank flanks forever!
7210f3 Blank flanks forever!
721000 [click]
7210f2 Blank flanks forever! Blank flanks forever!
721000 [horseshoes clinking]
7210f2 Whoa! You're cracking great!
721428 Thanks! [gasps] Oh, no! What if I get a cutie mark in it?!
721180 Then you'll be stuck doing it forever! Blank flanks, no more potential cutie mark activities!

721066 Well, Cutie Mark Day Camp is a bust.
72100a No, it isn't! It's a swell idea! We just can't seem to talk any sense into that... that Rumble.
721000 [rumble]
721000 [whoosh]
721065 Maybe we can't, but I bet I know somepony who can.
721000 [whoosh]
72117a Lemme get this straight. My little brother up-ended your entire camp? How in Equestria did he do that?
721066 Well, [inhales] [motor-mouth] it started when he couldn't toss a horseshoe or paddle a kayak or shoot an arrow or use a pencil, and we felt bad that he wasn't good at anything, but now he doesn't want a cutie mark at all because he's afraid he'll get stuck doing something he doesn't like forever, you know? [gasps]
72117a No, I don't. Rumble's good at all that stuff.
72100a Well, that doesn't make a lick of sense. Unless... he was bein' bad at stuff on purpose!
72117a [sighs] I was afraid of this...
721065 Afraid of what?
72117a Ever since I became a Wonderbolt, Rumble's either watching me or trying to fly like me. He won't do anything else. That's why I thought your camp was such a good idea.
721065 I don't understand. If Rumble wants to be a Wonderbolt someday, what's wrong with that?
72117a Not a thing. But right now, he isn't even giving anything else a chance.
72100a Sounds to me like Rumble isn't afraid of bein' put in a box at all.
721066 It doesn't?
72100a Nope. I think Rumble's already picked out a box. He's afraid he'll get a cutie mark that'll keep him from it.
721000 [whoosh]
721000 [quick Wonderbolts motif]
721000 [birds chirping]
7210f2 I don't know how to say this, Rumble, but Blank Flank Forever Camp is kinda...
721428 Boring?
721180 If we wanna stay blank flanks, we can't risk doing stuff.
721428 What if I get a cutie mark in being bored?
721065 Attention, blank flanks of Cutie Mark Day Camp!
721000 [thump]
721000 [foals chattering]
721066 The Cutie Mark Crusaders are pleased to announce today's special guest – Thunderlane!
721000 [whoosh]
72117a Hey, everypony! It's me!
721000 [whooshing]
721000 [foals ooh-ing and ahh-ing]
72100a Anypony who's interested, gather 'round for a day of activities with a genuine Wonderbolt!
721000 [thump]
721428 Uh, sorry, Rumble. But cutie mark or not, I'm not missing out on this!
7210f3 Whoa!
721000 [foals straining]
721000 [clink, spinning]
721000 [zip]
72100a All right, campers. It's time for our last activity of the day.
721066 A Wonderbolt obstacle course! Just like the one they'll fly through in their upcoming show!
721065 But on the ground, since not everypony has wings.
721000 [foals cheering]
721000 [bouncing noises]
721180 Thunderlane, aren't you gonna run the course?
72117a Nope! I know I'm a Wonderbolt and my cutie mark is all about moving fast, but I really like to cook!
721180 Since when?
72117a We take turns making the meals at Wonderbolts HQ. I didn't want to at first, but now I love it! I just wish I'd tried it sooner.
721180 You do?
72117a Of course! There's more to me than just flying, and I bet there's more to you, too.
721427 Kettle Corn:
721427 Obstacles are fun!
721427 Running free through mud and dirt
721427 Beats circle painting!
72100a That haiku pretty well sums it up.
721065 Looks like Thunderlane was right about the obstacle course getting Rumble to come back over.
721066 Hey, Rumble. Aren't you gonna do our Wonderbolt course?
721180 I'm cooking today. Maybe I'll do the course tomorrow.
72100a So you're comin' back tomorrow?
721065 You're not worried about getting your cutie mark?
721180 Nah. I already know I'm a good flyer. It kinda runs in the family. I guess it's time to see what other stuff I can do.
72117a Hm-hmm.

722000 [music]
722000 [quill breaks]
722003 Oh!
722000 [rumbling]
722005 [belches, sighs] Aw, thank goodness. I thought I had too many deep-fried gems.
722003 [mutters] It's from my parents! Spike, they won a zeppelin cruise and get to take the whole family! [sighs] I wish I had time to go with them, but there's just too many princess duties I have to take care of.
722005 Come on, Twilight. Even Princess Celestia takes a break sometimes, and she raises the sun.
722000 [beat]
722005 [grunt]
722003 [gasps]
722005 You need a vacation! I can keep track of the friendship log, boost community morale, and answer fan mail for a few days.
722003 But, Spike, you're as much a part of my family as anypony. I can't just leave you here to do all that work.
722005 [loudly] What?! I can't hear you! You're on vacation!
722003 I guess I could use a little time off from being a princess. You're the best, Spike!
722005 I know.
722003 I'm gonna go pack everything neatly into one suitcase!
722005 Wait for it...
722003 [shouting] Cruises have activities, right?! I should probably make a schedule?!
722005 There it is.
722000 [theme song]
722000 [awed muttering]
722321 Oh, gee. I am really looking forward to a relaxing vacation.
722320 Watch out. She won't admit it, but when your mother says "relaxing vacation", she means "doing something crazy". Last time, she ended up bungee-jumping over Luna Bay!
722321 What was that, hon?
722320 Oh, I was, uh, just telling Twilight about my new, uh, bingo strategy book! It's a, heh, real page-turner!
722193 Oh, I can't wait to get on this zeppelin and fly like a Pegasus!
722003 Really? I remember you getting airsick on Admiral Fairweather's Wild Ride at Pony Island.
722193 Oh, please! I grew out of airsickness a long time ago.
722000 [feedback]
722165 [over loudspeaker] I hope you ponies feel welcomed aboard, because you are!
722003 Well, that was an... assertive welcome.
722000 [whirring]
722429 [awed reactions]
722320 Guess this is what it's like to be big-time prize winners. [laughs] I just wish I could remember what contest we won.
722003 Wait. You don't know where this prize came from?
722321 When somepony offers you a free vacation, you just sign the paperwork and don't ask questions!
722320 Especially when it means we all get to fly off together. What should we do first?
722003 Well, I did categorize the ship's activities and make a schedule organized by each of our interests. Dad, you're easy. Bingo competition right here.
722320 Oh, I just love how the numbers and letters are organized in their little boxes. It's so satisfying.
722003 Shining Armor, they've got a tiny boat race in a tiny pool here.
722193 Aw, sis. Only you would remember I love tiny things.
722319 [babbles]
722003 And Cadance, there's a Peewee Princess Playtime here that Flurry's gonna love!
722319 [babbles]
722198 Oh, wonderful!
722321 Hmm. This barrel jumping at Neighagra Falls sounds interesting.
722003 Eh. I just want to see you all have a good time. And this works out perfectly, because we have room for the one thing I wanna do! Our ship passes the Frozen North at sunset, which is the only time you can see the astrological phenomenon known as the Northern Stars. It's like the stars are shooting out of the setting sun!
72242a [interested reactions]
722198 Well, we definitely don't want to miss that.
722003 Then it's settled. Hmm. But we don't have anything to do right now. Any suggestions?
722000 [feedback]
722165 [over loudspeaker] Attention, cruise ponies! Don't let this zeppelin be a bore! Leave your room and see the tour!
722198 A tour could be fun.
722429 [agreeing]
722193 I'm flying! I'm— [groans, gags]
722198 I'm afraid Flurry may be airsick. Since I know that isn't a problem for you, would you mind taking her below?
722193 [grunts]
722000 [feedback]
722165 [over loudspeaker] Far to our right, you can just make out the white tufts of Cloudsdale, where Princess Twilight Sparkle once toured the weather factory.
722000 [interested reactions]
722003 How'd he know that? And why announce it on a cruise?
722000 [indistinct conversations]
722198 Why don't we move to the other side of the deck?
722000 [indistinct conversations continue]
722165 [over loudspeaker] We are now high enough to see all of Canterlot, even the royal tree where Princess Twilight and her brother Shining Armor were born!
722003 What? That's not right.
722000 [clamoring]
722321 [gasps] Oooh!
722320 Let's get down for that!
72242b [laughing]
722003 Um, you guys know that's not where we were born. What are you so excited about?
722320 Well, it is a really nice tree, sweetheart.
72242c We just wanted to say how excited we are to be here!
722003 Um... yeah. Us, too.
722165 [over loudspeaker] On our route north, we will pass the spires of the Crystal Empire, where Princess Cadance rescued her Alicorn baby Spike from a monster made of fire!
722198 Well, that doesn't even make sense.
722320 Well, "Royal Grandparents" sounds a bit fancy, but of course you can take our picture.
722000 [camera shutters clicking]
722003 What?!
72242d [excited sounds]
722198 Uh... Oh!
722003 Okay, that's it! Does anypony know where the cruise announcer is?
722003 Excuse me, sir.
722165 You can call Iron Will "Iron Will"!
722003 [gasps] What are you doing here? And why do you keep announcing random things about me and my family?
722165 The assertiveness seminar market dried up, so Iron Will started a new career organizing themed vacation packages!
722003 And the theme of this vacation is...
722165 [over loudspeaker] Everypony, stomp your hooves if you are here for the premiere Cruise of the Princesses Experience!
722000 [clamoring, hooves stomping]
722000 [ponies clamoring]
722000 [door closes]
722003 Iron Will, I'm not sure it was entirely honest of you to offer this cruise to my family without telling us that ponies bought tickets just to see Cadance and me!
722165 Iron Will outlined all the details of the cruise in the Prize Acceptance and Consent Form that you signed.
722321 Well, when somepony offers you a free vacation, who reads the fine print?
722165 Iron Will prides himself on providing a quality vacation experience. But if Twilight Sparkle and her family don't want it, Iron Will can cancel the cruise and break the hearts of every princess-adoring pony on board.
722003 [groans]
72242e I love you, Princess Twilight!
722198 As much as I want a family vacation, I don't think I could entertain all these cruise ponies. My hooves are pretty full taking care of Flurry Heart.
722321 I guess we were just so excited by the idea of a family cruise.
722320 [sighs heavily] All right. I guess we better turn this ship around.
722003 Wait! Iron Will, what if I offered you a deal? If I agree to do whatever princess activities you want, will you promise that my family gets to do the activities they want?
722193 Sis, you don't have to do that. We want you to enjoy yourself, too.
722319 [babbles]
722003 I don't want the vacation to end now or let down all these ponies who were looking forward to seeing us. So what do you say, Iron Will? Do we have a deal?
722165 Princess Twilight has a deal!
722003 Great! So it looks like we have some time before Dad plays Bingo.
722165 Actually, we have just enough to pick the winner of our grand-prize raffle.
722003 Oh. Well... [chuckles] who doesn't like prizes?
722165 All right, cruise ponies! When the zeppelin flies, it's time for a prize!
722000 [ponies cheering]
722003 Thank you all for being so gracious and respectful to me and my family. And now, without further ado, the winner is...
722000 [papers rustling]
722003 Star Tracker!
722000 [hooves clopping]
722003 Congratulations, Star Tracker! Enjoy your prize! Okay, Dad! Bingo time!
722000 [bump!]
722003 Uh... Oh. I'm sorry. I don't have the prize.
722165 Congratulations to Star Tracker, who wins the grand prize – spending the day with Twilight as an honorary member of her family!
722000 [fireworks]
722000 [ponies cheering]
722003 That's the prize?!
72242f Uh-huh. [chuckles nervously]
722003 Okay, well... I guess you should come with us, honorary family member.
722320 Sure! [laughs] There's always room at the bingo table!
722003 [amplified] Ahem! Is everypony ready?
722320 Sure are, sweetie! Give that cage a whirl!
722003 Dad? [amplified] What did you say?
72242f He... He said to, uh, uh, give it a-a whirl. Heh.
722003 Oh. Um, thanks.
722000 [sloooop]
722000 [rattling]
722003 [amplified] I-19!
722320 Hey, hey! Now we're talkin'! This Princess Bingo is great!
722003 Did you get that one, Dad? [amplified] Can anypony tell me how my dad is doing?
72242f He, uh, he said the Princess Bingo is, uh, great. Heh.
72200f [chanting] Princess Bingo! Princess Bingo! Princess Bingo! [continues underneath]
72242f Twilight is my favorite time of day. [laughs] And it's also your name. [laughs] So I just thought that was cool.
722003 [forced laugh]
722003 Phew! Just made it!
722000 [squeak]
722003 And I'm ready to give you the tiny boat race of your life!
722193 [whinnies, sick noises]
722003 Are you sure you're not airsick, big brother?
722193 [queasily] No way. How can I be airsick? I'm in the water, so it totally cancels out! [gurgles]
722003 I don't think that's how it works. But I'm ready if you are.
722165 Technically, Princess Twilight Sparkle should officiate the princess paddle boat race.
722321 Well, I suppose I could could race your brother.
722003 Oh. Well, as long as Shining Armor gets to race, I'm happy.
722000 [magic zap]
722000 [cameras clicking]
722000 [thump]
72242f [nervous noises] S-Sorry.
722003 [inhales]
72242f [nervous] I'm gonna write about this race tonight in my journal! [nervous noises] It's just so exciting!
722003 On your mark, get set—
72242f Go! [laughs]
722321 [cheers]
722000 [splashing]
722321 Oh, my word, that was exciting! Wasn't it, son? [laughing]
722193 [nauseous] Just so everypony knows, I'm getting out of this boat because of how not sick I feel.
722000 [splash]
722321 Aww, that's all right, dear. We'll take you back to the room.
722000 [squeak]
722165 [through microphone] That was just the first heat! Of ten!
722000 [abs popping]
722165 Now, who's ready to see a princess face when they win their race?!
722000 [cruise ponies cheering]
722000 [babies gurgling]
722319 [giggling]
722003 Cadance, I'm so glad you got in the Peewee Princess Playtime!
722198 Flurry is having a wonderful time.
722003 That's great. I'm just on my way to take some old-time Appleloosan photos!
72242f Themed photoshoots are the best. [nervous noise]
722003 And then do a quick question-and-answer session on becoming an Alicorn before Mom's barrel ride at Neighagra Falls! I really hope I don't miss that.
722198 Twilight, are you sure you don't mind doing all of these princess activities?
722003 Mind? What? Absolutely not. I mean, you guys are having fun, right? [sighs] Besides, I have to make sure these cruise ponies are happy if I want to be a good princess.
722198 You're already a good princess, Twilight.
722003 Honestly, as long as I get to see the Northern Stars tonight with everypony, I'll be happy. But right now, I gotta go take some pictures. See you later!
722430 Why don't you play and make a princess friend?
722000 [babies gurgling]
722198 Uh... I am so sorry, everypony, but it looks like Flurry needs her nap.
722003 Oh, why did that last question have to be a two-parter? I just hope I have time for one barrel ride with Mom!
722000 [thunk]
722000 [crunch]
722321 [gasps] Neighagra Falls was amazing! The endless open air, the water in my mane! Oh! The small confines of the barrel!
722320 [chuckles] Another relaxing vacation in the books, hon. [kiss]
722000 [splash]
722321 Oh, honey, I know you're disappointed, but we waited as long as we could. Maybe you should take a break from these princess things.
722003 Disappointed? No! I've just been answering some detailed questions about Alicorns! You know how much I love details!
722321 I just don't want you to forget. It's your vacation, too.
722003 How can I when it's a totally successful vacation?
722320 All right. Well, uh, we can't wait to see those Northern Stars!
722165 Iron Will lived up to his side of the bargain, and Princess Twilight only has one more thing to do for the day.
722165 [through microphone] It's your last chance. Come get in line if you want the princess to sign!
722431 [excited chattering]
722000 [time passing music]
722431 [excited squealing]
722432 [indistinct] I'm never letting this go!
722003 [sighs] How long have you been waiting?
72242f [nervous noises]
722000 [distant whooshing]
722003 Oh, no. What time is it?! [panicked noises, gasps]
722320 [in middle distance] Wow. [laughing]
722003 [crying]
722433 [laughing]
722003 [tearing up] I missed them? I missed the Northern Stars? [crying]
722198 You were right, Twilight. They were breathtaking.
722319 [gurgles]
722320 Aw, we wish you'd been here to see it, sweet-pea, but we're sure you're making a whole bunch of cruise ponies happy.
72242f [laughs] I'm so happy I could cry!
722003 [suddenly indignant] Oh, yeah. The cruise ponies are happy. My family is happy. Even Iron Will is happy.
722000 [crunch]
722003 You know who isn't happy? Me!
722000 [smack]
722000 [crunch]
72242f [yelp of pain] Augh, my hoof!
722003 [insincerely] I'm sorry. But maybe that wouldn't have happened if you weren't practically standing on my tail! Not even my real family stands so close! Rrgh!
722000 [thump]
722198 Twilight?
722003 I only made that deal with Iron Will so my family and the cruise ponies could have the vacation they wanted.
722198 What about what you wanted?
722003 I just want everypony to be happy.
722198 Well, sometimes ponies want more from a princess than you can give, and it can be hard to know where to draw the line.
722003 You seem to know pretty well.
722198 Once I had Flurry Heart, the line was easier for me to see. You will always have obligations as a princess, but you also have an obligation to yourself.
722003 [sighs] You're right. I think I need to set some boundaries. But first, I owe somepony an apology.
722321 Aww, how's that, dearie?
72242f Better. Thanks.
722000 [door opens]
72242f [panicking] Uh, I think I should go!
722003 No, Star Tracker. You should stay. I have something to tell you. All of you. I'm glad you all got to do the things you wanted, but I should have stood up for myself so that I could do what I wanted, too. [to Star Tracker] It wasn't fair of me to lash out at you. If I felt like you were standing too close, I should have said something. I'm sorry. [to everypony] What do you say we do something off the schedule?
722434 [gasps]
72242f Who are you?
722003 Yup! We're gonna do something I want us to do, as a family. Honorary members, too.
722193 [gags]
722003 [giggles]
722319 [giggles]
722213 [laughs]
722320 Now that's cold! This is more like it!
72242f You and your family have been really kind to include me, but you deserve your own vacation together. [laughs nervously] And I'm really glad we met, too!
722003 Ohhh!
722000 [splat]
722000 [boing]
722165 [through microphone] Attention, cruise ponies! If it's your dream, come to the deck for ice cream!
722431 [excited chatter]
72242f Oh, no! Leave the princess alone!
722165 What did you say to Iron Will?
722003 It's okay, everypony. [through microphone] [clears throat] First, I want to thank all of you for coming. It means a lot that you'd spend your hard-earned bits just to be with us. But I honestly came on this cruise to take some time off from being a princess. I'm just a pony, too, after all. And even though I want everypony here to be happy, I'd really like to spend the rest of the cruise relaxing with my family.
72242e Of course, Princess Twilight.
722430 But why was this trip advertised as a Cruise of the Princesses if you just wanted to get away?
722165 [whistling] Iron Will's Cruise of the Princesses makes no guarantees as to the participation of actual princesses.
722000 [pages rustling]
722435 What?!
722431 [angry chatter]
722165 But Iron Will learned his lesson before. Satisfaction not guaranteed. No refuuuuuuunds!
722000 [ponies gasping]
722000 [guitar riff]
722193 Wow. He may be pushy and manipulative, but nopony can say that minotaur isn't prepared.
722003 There's still plenty of activities. We pass Fillydelphia on the way back. I could give Flurry Heart a quick history tour.
722198 That's very thoughtful. But right now, the family and I have something scheduled for you.
722320 Behold! The Northern Stars!
722319 [gurgling]
722003 You did all this for me? This is amazing! Thank you. And Shining Armor, I can't believe you're up there even though you're airsick!
722193 I am not air— [gurgles] [nauseous] Oh, okay. Maybe I'm not feeling great!
722319 [laughing]
722321 Oh, dear!
722320 Whatever you say.
722198 [giggling]
722003 Now this is the only activity I need.
722000 [credits]
723007 Okay. All we need is a dot of salt, a dab of sugar, and a spritz of ginger.
723003 Uh... Are those real measurements? How do you keep track without a recipe?
723007 Pie baking is more art than science. And this will be my masterpiece! It's to celebrate Rainbow Dash's seventy-third Wonderbolt training session!
723003 Seventy-third? That's specific.
723007 I know! The pie is blueberry because Wonderbolt outfits are blue. The crust is rainbow, for obvious reasons. But the most special part is the seventy-three super secret sweets and spices that represent each training session! [giggles] Could you please pass the... [quickly] brown sugar, pink sugar, sweetroot, apple jelly, berry mash, and a towel?
723000 [splattering]
723003 You sure are going to a lot of trouble for Rainbow Dash's pie.
723007 Phew! That's because I know how much she loves them! My pies are her favorite! It's worth all the trouble to see her happy. Now I'm going to need some cocoa powder, cocoa flakes— Ooh! Cocoa bar! [chomp] [mouthful] Want some?
723003 Isn't that for the pie?
723007 [gulps, laughing] Oh, Twilight! That's hilarious! You don't mix chocolate into a blueberry pie! This is my mid morning, pie-making chocolate fuel that keeps this pie baking train chugging down the tracks! [chomp, babbles, gulp] Break time's over! Now let's finish this pie! Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, choo-choo!
723003 [chuckles]
723000 [theme song]
72307c Good training, everypony. Nice work, Crash. You really added that sparkle to that pressure diamond-drop.
72300c [gasps]
723007 Surprise! Happy seventy-third Wonderbolt training session! [blows party horn]
72300c My seventy-third training session? That's specific.
723007 I know! I'm just so proud and happy for you, and I've been counting all your training sessions, and I was going to wait until your hundredth, but I got too excited, and I know how much you love pie, so happy seventy-third training session!
72300c Whaaa?! You didn't have to do this.
723007 I know I didn't have to, but I reeeally wanted to! [squealing] Have a bite.
72300c Whoa! What's that?! Huh. Guess it was nothing. But wow, heh. This pie is the best I've ever had! Mmm! Is that cinnamon?
723007 I knew you'd love it! Have more. I made the whole thing for you.
72300c Really? Oh, that's so great! But I need to go change. A-And then I have to take Tank to the vet. Heh. His sensitive tortoise tummy's been acting up again. Do you mind if I take this pie with me?
723007 Of course not! I gotta get back to my shift at Sugarcube Corner anyway. Congratulations again!
72300c Heh. Thanks.
723000 [trash cart squeaking]
723007 [sighs] I knew she'd love it. [gasps deeply] Is that...? Is that...?!
723000 [zoom]
723007 Stop!
723000 [clattering]
723007 You didn't see a blueberry rainbow-crust seventy-three-ingredient pie with a slice eaten out of it in here, did you?
723436 Uh... n-no?
723007 Right. Of course you didn't. That would be ridiculous. Because I made it for Rainbow Dash, and she loves my pies. She would never throw them away like trash in the trash with other trash, right? Right?!
723436 Um... riiight?
723007 Hmmm... That pie couldn't have been the one I made. I must be seeing things. I did have a lot of chocolate this morning. [chomp, gulps] But what if I wasn't seeing things? What if that was my pie? [scoffs] That would be bananas! [chuckles, laughing crazily] [gasps] Unless Rainbow Dash's been replaced by an imposter who throws delicious pies away!
723000 [beat]
723007 Or... has she been brainwashed by a pie-hating evil queen?
723000 [beat]
723007 You make a good point. Rainbow Dash is too stubborn to be brainwashed. Plus she hates washing. Hmm. There's something else going on here. Let's look up a few of the more recent pies I've made for her. The boysenberry pie I made for her birthday... and her three half-birthday lemon meringues... and the "It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway Day" custard pie! She ate all of these... Right?
72300c [gasps] Another pie!? Thank you so much! Whoa! What's that?!
723000 [zip!]
72300c [chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.
72300c Awesome! Three lemon meringues? Uh... Hey, what's that over there?
723000 [thunk, thunk, thunk]
72300c [chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!
723007 Happy "It's Not Your Birthday But Here's a Pie Anyway" Day!
72300c Thank you! No way! Check that out!
723000 [thunk]
723000 [clang]
723023 Oh! It's not even my birthday!
72300c Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!
723007 Have I ever really seen Rainbow Dash eat one of my pies? And do I always look when somepony points behind me? What's there?! Heh. Good one. But I need answers.
723007 I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie every month she's been a Wonderbolt, and you're telling me you've never seen her eat one?
723437 Uhhh...
72307c Uh, affirmative. Or, uh, negative. Um... I-I-I mean, she wasn't seen eating one.
723007 Hmm... Interesting. Very interesting.
72307c Are we under investigation?
723007 As chief detective on the pie case, I've labeled you all ponies-of-interest. So it's best you tell me everything you know.
72307c Well, we have been getting mysterious monthly pie donations.
723007 [gasps] Would you be able to pick these pies out of a line up?
723000 [ceiling fan creaking]
723007 I hear Rainbow Dash's pet tortoise Tank has been having tummy troubles. When did it start?
72312b About a week ago. Poor Tank had all the telltale signs of sugar overload – jittery shell, sleeplessness, reptilian indigestion.
723007 Hmmm... And this all happened the day after I made Rainbow Dash a "Thanks For Lending Me Your Jacket" peach pie. It seems the pieces of the puzzle are plopping into place, but the picture isn't pretty. [gasps] Note to self – P. Alliteration Pie. Is that everything, Doctor?
72312b Well, there's also this.
723007 Interesting. Did you have the lab analyze the flavor of that pie?
72312b No. But you know, Miss Cheerilee was in here not long ago. The class hamster was having similar symptoms. [gasps] Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!
723007 Perhaps. And I just might know Pony Patient Zero!
723000 [pipe bubbling]
72305b Dr Fauna's right. I do always have to remind the foals and fillies not to share the pies with the class hamster. Animals just can't digest pony food.
723007 Indeed. But where do these pies come from?
72305b Well, they're from Rainbow Dash. She drops off her "Day After Rainbow Dash's Half-Birthday" pie every year.
723007 Did you say the day after her half-birthday?! Very, very interesting. Because I give her a pie on her half-birthday every year! And I have a feeling it's the same pie.
72305b Well, wherever it comes from, the students just love it.
723007 I'm so glad. At least I can be sure somepony is.
723007 She didn't eat the blueberry. She didn't eat the banana. She didn't eat the cream, and she didn't eat the chocolate. She didn't eat any of 'em! Why?! And don't tell me this all just started recently! It's been going on for years! Cheerilee said so herself. If there's one thing I know, you can't escape the truth!
723000 [dings]
723000 [whoosh!]
723000 [lightning strikes]
723007 Rainbow Dash doesn't like pie, and she's been lying to me about it the whole time! [screams]
723000 [door opens]
723007 [muffled scream]
723008 Pinkie Pie?! Pinkie Pie!
723000 [clicking]
723000 [ka-chunk!]
723008 Whooooaaaa! [grunting] Oh. Party-planning cave. Right. You okay? Or are you just screamin' for fun?
723007 Screaming is fun. But I'm not okay! I've been making Rainbow Dash pies for years, but she doesn't even like them. She's been lying to me!
723008 But everypony loves your pies. They're the greatest thing since sliced apples.
723007 Thank you!
723008 And I could swear I've seen her eat one of your pies before.
723007 Have you reeeaaally?
723008 Um, I... thought I had. That's why I said it?
723007 Are you sure?
723008 Maybe I haven't...?
723007 Exactly! Because it's all been a sham! Rainbow Dash has been laughing at my pies behind my back and scheming of a way to get rid of them for years!
723000 [clouds rumbling]
723000 [thunder]
72300c Bring forth the worst-tasting food in all of Equestria!
723000 [carts rolling]
72300c And now I will destroy Pinkie Pie's horrid abominations, freeing the land of these disgusting pies forever!
723007 Nooooooo!
723000 [magic zaps]
72300c Good riddance, strawberry cream and peaches 'o plenty! Begone, apple crumble and lemon surprise!
723000 [magic zaps]
72300c Gone! Gone! Gone! [laughing evilly]
723000 [thunder]
723008 I really don't think that's what's happening.
723007 I don't think so either. I know so.
723008 Well, I've got just the thing to get your mind off all this madness. We've had a great apple harvest, so I was hopin' you could whip up a few of your delicious pies.
723007 Yes. I will make pies. Lots of pies. I'm going to make Rainbow Dash so many pies, it'll force her to admit the truth. Or I'll catch her in the act of getting rid of them. Operation - "Pie of Lies" is a go. Thanks, Applejack. I knew I could count on you to come up with a plan.
723008 I don't think that's what I did. Also, uh... how do you get out of here?
72300c [snoring]
723007 Surprise!
72300c [yelps] W-W-What's happening?!
723007 Happy unofficial "Wake Your Friends Up" Day!
72300c Ugh. I've never heard of "Wake Your Friends Up" Day.
723007 Well, it's unofficial. But I made you your favorite pie in celebration! Ta-da! Gifts are the second most important part of "Wake Your Friends Up" Day.
72300c What's the first most important part?
723007 Accepting the gifts and enjoying them immediately.
72300c Uh... Well, I'm sorry I forgot about "Wake Your Friends Up" Day. Let me make it up to you. Here!
723007 [sneezes]
723000 [thudding]
7231f0 [chomp]
723007 [sneezes] The pie! Where'd it go?!
72300c What do you mean where did it go? Heh-heh. Mmm-mmm.
723007 How—?! Where—?! When—?! [distressed sounds]
723007 Congratulations on your seventy-fourth Wonderbolt training session! Here's a pie. Now eat it!
72300c Okay, this is getting a little out of hoof. I haven't even trained yet.
723007 Well, I wanted to pre-celebrate because I already know how great you're gonna do. Eat the pie!
72300c Pinkie, look out!
723007 I'm not gonna fall for— [screams] Whoa! [grunting]
723000 [splat]
72300c Pinkie! Are you okay?!
723007 [grunting] Get me down!
723438 Sorry, ma'am, but we have to make sure you didn't sustain any internal injuries.
723007 But the pie! What happened to the pie?!
72300c Oh! The pie was delicious! You just get better!
723007 Noooooooo!
723007 [unconvincing] Ah! Somepony help me! Rainbow Dash, thank goodness you're here! I was trying to fix the top pie on my pie pyramid, but the whole thing became unstable. And there's only one way to save me! You have to eat the pies!
72300c Don't worry, I got ya!
723007 Oh, right. Or you could save me that way.
72300c You gotta be more careful, okay?
723007 [growls] Rrgh!
723000 [thud]
723000 [pies splat]
723007 Rainbow Dash! I wanted to thank you for saving me from the pie pyramid, so have a pie! Have three! Have fifteen! I know how much you love them! Now eat up!
72300c Uh... Thanks!
723000 [fillies laughing]
72300c I can't wait to eat... [loudly] ...all these pies!
723000 [fillies clamoring]
723007 What?! Where did they—?! How did you—?!
72300c Delicious! You did it again, Pinkie!
723007 [growls]
723007 Rainbow Dash, there you are! I made a pie for everypony, and you're the only one who hasn't eaten hers yet. So here. Your pie. For you to eat. Now.
72300c Are you okay? You seem to be staring more than usual.
723007 I just really like to watch others enjoy my pies. [unhinged giggling]
723000 [beat]
72300c You sure you don't have to blink?
723007 Me? Nope. I'm not much of a blinker. [licking] Don't mind me. Go ahead and take a bite.
72300c Well... Do I want to take a big bite or a small bite...? I just don't know... Or maybe medium? No, no, no. Definitely not medium.
723007 [panting] [strained] Just try some.
72300c Ahhhh... Do you have any milk?
723007 [grinding teeth]
723000 [deep bell ring]
7230a7 [chomps slowly]
723000 [bird flaps slowly]
723000 [whipping]
72300c [slurps]
723000 [bell rings]
72300c Ah, never mind. Your pies are just too good to resist.
723007 What?! No! No! That's it! I can't take it!
72300c Uh, everything okay, Pinkie?
723007 No! Everything is not okay! You hate my pies!
72300c What are you talking about?
723007 You know exactly what I'm talking about! I saw what you did! Well, I didn't see what you did. But I know that you've been fake-eating my pies! You threw away the pie I made for your seventy-third Wonderbolt training session, and I know you secretly somehow got rid of all the other pies I gave you! Admit it!
72300c That's crazy! What do you think I did? Somehow make them all disappear into thin air?
723000 [splat]
72300c [nervous chuckle] Okay. So maybe I made one of them disappear into thin air.
723007 How could you?!
72300c What?! I, uh... I-I just wanted to share these amazing pies with the folks of Cloudsdale! So I, uh... I was trying to send them up via... balloon mail.
723007 But you just said they were delicious.
72300c Well, obviously that's because... I have amnesia!
723000 [beat]
72300c I've been brainwashed!
723000 [beat]
72300c I-It's Opposite Day?
723007 Your memory is working fine, you hate washing, and I know today's not Opposite Day because I baked you a pie for it every year. A pie that you'd probably just throw away. Or give to charity. Or destroy with your laser eyes while laughing at me!
72300c Laser eyes?
723007 Oh! Oh! So you admit it!
72300c What? No! I can explain!
723007 I don't want to hear it!
723000 [pie tin clangs]
72300c She won't listen to me. She won't let me apologize. [sighs] I feel terrible.
723003 Well, you have been lying to her. To all of us, actually.
723008 Yeah. Is there anything else you're lyin' about that we should know?
72300c No! Well, not that I can think of off the top of my head. Is it my fault that I don't like pies? And not just Pinkie's pies. All pies! I know how much she loves making pies, and if I told her I didn't like them, it would have crushed her.
723008 Uh, you kinda crushed her anyway.
72300c Oh, but I...! [stutters, sighs] You're right. I guess I should've just eaten the pies in the first place. [gasps] Wait! That's it! I know how I can make it up to her!
723007 Pee-yew! Gummy, is that you?
723000 [thud]
723007 Huh. What is that? Oh. It's you.
72300c Pinkie Pie, wait! I know now that I should've been honest with you from the start, because lying to your friends is wrong. And because getting rid of all those pies was a giant hassle. I mean, do you have any idea how many pies you've made for me over the years?
723007 Yes, I know exactly how many. I have a very detailed pie-ling system.
72300c Of course you do. The point is I thought the hassle was worth it just to spare your feelings, but I was wrong. So to make up for it, I made this pie for you. Well, I guess I made it for me. To eat in front of you. Point is I'm eating this pie for friendship!
723007 Wait. That smelly circular monstrosity is a pie?
72300c Yeah! I know I can't go back and eat all the pies you made for me in the past, so instead I'm going to eat this one giant one for you now. So here I go.
723000 [splat]
723000 [splat]
72300c Ahhhh...
723007 Wait! I can't watch you do this!
723000 [clattering]
723007 I mean, is that crust or some kind of concrete?
72300c Yeah, honestly, I have no idea.
723007 Oh, I can't believe you're willing to eat this terrible pie for me. It's ridiculous, and this whole thing is overly complicated, and... [sighs] I think I finally understand why you lied.
72300c Whoa! What's that?!
723000 [zip!]
72300c [chewing noises] Huh. Guess it was nothing. Heh-heh.
723007 [squeals] I'm so glad you enjoyed my pies!
723000 [thunk, thunk, thunk]
72300c [chewing noises] Oh, never mind. Heh. Great pies!
723007 [high-pitched squeal]
72300c No way! Check that out!
723000 [thunk]
723000 [clang]
723023 Oh! It's not even my birthday!
72300c Oh, sorry. Guess it was nothing. [slurp] Mmm! But that custard was everything!
723007 Seeing you eat my pies makes me the happiest pony in all of Equestria!
72300c Heh. I know it does.
723007 You did a lot of ridiculous and overly complex things to get rid of my pies because it made you happy to see me happy. Just like I went to a lot of effort to make you the pies because it made me happy to see you happy.
72300c Yes!
723007 And if you're willing to go through all of that, it really shows how much you're willing to do for your friends.
72300c Aw, shucks. It was nothing.
723007 Now get out of that thing and give me a hug!
723000 [splat]
723007 Just remember. In the future, you can always be honest with me.
723008 Uh, I could've told her that.
72300c [straining] Heh. Cool. H-How about this? Your hugs are too tight.
723007 [laughing] No, they're not.
72300c [sighs]
723000 [credits]
72427c Oooh! Excuse me. When does the noon train from the Crystal Empire arrive?
724439 Uh... noon?
72427c Heh. Right. Sorry. I'm just a little excited because my friend Sunburst is coming.
72427c He's my oldest friend. I mean, we've known each other practically forever. We have tons in common.
72427c We both love magic and games and jokes – everything, really. Now that I think about it, there isn't a pony in all of Equestria I have more in common with.
724000 [muffled dance music]
724000 [train whistle blows]
72427c [gasps]
724000 [brakes hissing]
724000 [ponies chattering]
724000 [door closes]
724000 [train chugging]
724315 Starlight?
72427c [gasps] Sunburst! You made it!
724315 Of course! I've been looking forward to this visit for a long time.
72427c [grunts] Whoa. How long are you staying?
724315 Uh, just a... little reading for the train.
72427c [chuckles] Same old Sunburst. [grunts] It's going to be so great spending time together. Just like old times. You and me doing the stuff we like – games, magic...
724315 Antiquing.
72427c What?
724315 Antiquing. You know I like antiquing.
72427c You do?
724315 Um, of course! Historical knickknacks, ancient relics... Oh! You are so lucky! Ponyville is antique central!
72427c It is?
724315 How have we never talked about this? We are going antiquing, and you are gonna love it!
72427c Okay. Let's drop your stuff off at the castle first.
724315 Sure. Only... we may need to make a few of trips. [nervous chuckle]
724000 [theme song]
724315 This is so great! Who knew I'd be the one showing you the cool sights of Ponyville?
72427c I'm a little surprised myself.
724315 Wow! What a difference between the hoof-molded bricks and the extruded ones, right?
72427c Uh-huh... Ha-ha...
724315 Oooh! Check out all these chandeliers! Sometimes, the crystals have magical properties.
72427c Oh. Oh, that's cool. How do you—?
724003 Sunburst! I'm so glad you're here!
724315 In the antique store?
724003 In Ponyville! Starlight's really been looking forward to your visit. Though I'm glad you're in the antique store, too. I'm usually the only one.
724315 That's crazy! Who doesn't like antiquing, right?
72427c [nervous chuckle] Right.
724003 Oooh, look! An ancient map of Equestria made by the Mighty Helm.
724315 Without the help of unicorn magic or Pegasus flight, the Earth ponies of the Mighty Helm were able to map the entire coast of Equestria.
72427c Coooool...
724000 [montage music]
7243a1 [gasps]
7243a1 [laughing]
724315 You don't have to pretend to like all this stuff.
72427c What? No! I do like it. I mean, if you like it, I like it. Besides, we've almost looked at everything, right?
724003 Oh, wow! You have got to see this Saddle Arabian vanity!
72427c This shop looked a lot smaller from the outside.
724000 [montage music continues]
724315 Did you see this Palominian letter opener?
724003 Wow! That goes well with this ancient phoenix feather quill! We could write to each other!
7243a1 Pen pals! [laughing]
72427c [joins laughter, sighs] Um, I-I really like this old-timey barrel.
724315 Actually, the stuff I bought is inside the barrel. But I can't wait to see what it is!
72427c Wait. You don't know what you bought?
724315 Mm-mmm. It's a blind buy. Sometimes shops get too busy to go through everything, so they load up a box or barrel and sell it without knowing what's inside.
724003 Buying one is sort of like a treasure hunt.
724315 Once I found a first edition History of Equestria in the original Olde Ponish.
724003 Hliet foresettan pliht!
7243a1 [laughing]
724315 It's an Olde Ponish saying. "Reward prefers risk!" Uh, it loses something in the translation.
72427c Mm. [chuckles, sighs]
724003 Why don't we look through this stuff later?
724315 Yeah. What do you want to do, Starlight?
72427c Well, I don't know if you're gonna remember this, but...
724315 [gasps] Is this...?!
72427c Dragon Pit!
724003 I remember that game. You two used to play it?
724315 Pretty much any time we weren't working on magic. I can't believe you found a copy!
724000 [die clatters]
72427c Sunburst would get so excited whenever his dragon got trapped, he knocked the whole board over.
724003 That's adorable.
724315 Uh, well, it's an exciting game. But I have a little more control over my horn now.
724000 [die clatters]
72427c Uh-oh! Somepony's dragon's gonna get trapped!
724000 [rumble]
724000 [boing]
724000 [marble rolling]
724003 Doesn't seem so exciting to m—
724000 [clunk]
724003 Aaah! [laughing]
724000 [whoosh]
724000 [clatter]
724315 Huh. I guess it is adorable.
72427c [chuckle]
72427c I hope you're enjoying your visit so far.
724315 Are you kidding? I mean, first antiquing and then spending time with Twilight?
72427c Oh. Yeah. She's pretty great.
724315 Right? I mean, I know she's a princess, but I never thought she'd be so fun to just hang out with.
72427c Well, she is the Princess of Friendship.
724315 [chuckle] Right. I guess that makes sense.
72427c So tomorrow I thought—
724315 I suppose I'm just surprised at how well we get along. I don't have much in common with most ponies.
72427c You two are pretty similar. I don't know many ponies who are fluent in Olde Ponish.
724315 Exactly! I probably have more in common with Twilight than any pony in Equestria!
72427c Right...
724315 [sighs] Anyway, I better get some sleep. [yawns] Ponyville might be small, but there's a lot to do. Maybe we should ask Twilight what she recommends we see!
72427c Um... sure.
724315 Great! Good night, Starlight.
72427c Um...
724000 [door closes]
72427c ...Good night.
724000 [door opens]
72427c [singsong] Knock, knock!
724315 [yelps] Oh. Hi, Starlight. [yawns] Is it morning already?
72427c Yup! Maybe a bit early, but like you said, there's a lot to see in Ponyville.
724315 Uh... Right. Okay.
72427c Plus, I couldn't really sleep. I just kept thinking about all the stuff we have in common and how much fun we'll have today.
724315 Great. Uh, is Twilight up yet?
72427c Actually, I'm pretty sure she's busy with princess stuff today.
724315 Oh. [yawns]
72427c But I've got a full day of stuff planned. Just you and me.
724315 Uh, great. Um, would you mind turning around or preferably... leaving the room so I could get changed?
72427c Oh! Right! Sorry. [laughs nervously]
724000 [door closes]
724000 [fly buzzing]
72427c One genuine Sweet Apple Acres apple tree! Because we used to drink so much apple juice as foals?
724315 Uh, I don't remember that.
72427c Really? I mean, it was all we drank. Here. Try an apple. I bet that'll jog your memory. [grunts]
724000 [thunk]
724037 [yelps] Ow.
72427c Trixie? What are you doing here?
724037 Huh. I often seek the privacy of the orchard to practice new feats of amazement. And also, I fell asleep.
72427c Oh. Well, Sunburst and I were just catching up, so—
724037 [gasps] I don't suppose the two of you want to see a never-before-witnessed magical marvel?
724315 Sure!
72427c [sighs] Why not?
724037 Behold, visiting friend from Starlight's past, and be amazed by the Great and Powerful – and current best friend of Starlight – Trixie!
724000 [fireworks]
724000 [chains rattling]
724000 [padlock clicks]
724037 I give you... the Unicorn Escape! [grunting] Just... a sec... One more... [grunts] twist... and... [grunts] [straining] The Great and Powerful Trixie requires a little assistance.
724315 I know this trick. There's a special link, but I could never hold the chain up long enough to find it.
724000 [chains rattling]
724315 [grunting]
724037 [pained grunting]
724000 [pop!]
724037 Well, if I could do magic like that, I'd have a whole slew of new tricks at my disposal.
724315 I always liked close-up magic because I knew I could do it if I just practiced enough.
724037 [giggling]
724000 [montage music continues]
724000 [clomp, clomp]
724000 [newspaper tearing]
724000 [cards shuffling]
724000 [box shaking]
724000 [ball rolling]
724037 Starlight, why didn't you tell me how much Sunburst and I had in common?
72427c [sarcastic] Gee. I don't know.
72427c I know Trixie's "magic" is, you know, fun. But the Mirror Pool is actual magic.
724315 Whoa. This place is pure pony lore.
72427c Yup. I mean, it's supposed to be all dangerous, and I guess I shouldn't have broken the seal to get in, but you wanted to see the sights of Ponyville, right?
724315 So, Pinkie Pie just dove in and made copies of herself?
72427c Mm-hmm. If we made copies of ourselves, we could get a year's worth of hanging out over in one day.
724000 [beat]
72427c Uh, not that we would.
724000 [tapping]
724315 Do you hear that?
72427c Oh. I hope it's not a leftover Pinkie Pie.
724242 [deadpan] Not exactly.
72427c Maud! How did you get in here?
724242 [deadpan] This cavern's actually connected to mine.
724315 Uh, what are you doing?
724242 [deadpan] Tapping.
72427c Maud isn't super chatty. I mean, you and I could sit around and talk all day, but she looks pretty busy.
724315 Are you taking some kind of core sample?
724242 [deadpan] Not exactly. I'm uncovering this section of strata for closer study. You might want to step back.
724000 [crumbling]
72427c [coughing]
724242 [deadpan] I'm studying this area's metamorphic—
724315 —foliation. Is this gneiss, phyllite, or slate? Wow. The pressure above must be pretty uniform to get the planar fabric to be this consistent.
724242 [deadpan] You know about geology?
724315 Eh, I dabble. For example, by the speleothems in this cave, I kind of figured there was another way out.
724242 [deadpan] Because of the calcite deposits.
72427c [sighs]
724000 [montage music continues]
724000 [bubbling]
724000 [squeaking]
724000 [ting!]
724000 [tapping]
724003 Starlight? Where's Sunburst?
72427c [mumbles "I don't know"] Doing stage magic with Trixie? Studying new rocks with Maud? You're here, so I guess you two aren't off translating some ancient Olde Ponish text.
724003 What are you talking about? Why would Sunburst be doing any of that? I thought he came to Ponyville to see you.
72427c I thought so, too, but it hasn't worked out that way. When we were foals, we had more in common than any two ponies in Equestria. But now, it seems like he's got more in common with my friends than he does with me.
724000 [clunk]
724003 Oh. Everypony changes, but that doesn't mean there aren't still things you both like. You both love magic, right?
72427c Magic?
724003 Sure. You're really good at it, and Sunburst practically knows every spell that ever was.
72427c [gasps] You're right! Thanks, Twilight! You're the best!
724003 Heh. I try.
724315 Starlight, what happened? Maud and I found some fascinating sedimentary stratum, but when I turned to show you, you were gone.
72427c Maud does have a way of making rocks really interesting, but I wanted to work on something a little more "us".
724315 What's this?
72427c Just a little something I made up.
724315 Whoa! You made up this spell? Just now?
72427c Yup!
724000 [magic zap]
724000 [wind whirling]
724315 Wow.
72427c I know, right? But wait, there's more!
724000 [magic zap]
724000 [wind whirling]
724338 Cool, right?!
72443a Um... sure.
724338 Now we can play Dragon Pit! Just like we used to!
72443a Actually, I thought we could go with Maud and—
724338 I mean, nothing was better than just you and me playing this game when we were foals, right?
72443a Starlight.
724338 Do you what to be red or blue?
72443a Starlight! I don't want to play the game at all!
724000 [magic zap]
724000 [whoosh]
724000 [shimmer!]
724000 [door creaks]
724003 What's going on in here?
72427c Nothing. I was trying to have fun doing the one thing I thought we still had in common, but I guess we don't even have that anymore.
724315 I don't understand. Starlight and I have known each other since we were foals, but that doesn't mean we have to be foals to hang out.
724003 Uh, Starlight does have a tendency to overdo.
724315 I mean, it is surprising how well I get along with all of her friends, but she and I still have tons in common.
724003 Maybe you just need to remind her what those things are.
724315 That's it! That's exactly what I'll do! Uh, right after I think of them.
724003 Uh-oh.
724037 Obviously you and I hit it off. I am quite impressive. And we share a love for prestidigitation.
724000 [poof!]
724315 Right. And Starlight and I share a lot of things, too. I just need to think of them. What else do you guys have in common?
724037 Well, we've both made not-so-great choices in the past.
724000 [pop, pop!]
724000 [pop!]
724037 And we're self-conscious about everypony judging us, even though we've both changed and are trying hard to be better.
724000 [sawing]
724315 Yeah, we don't really have that.
724000 [beat]
724000 [clop, clop]
724037 Hmph! I can think of something you have in common. You're both poor practice audiences.
724242 [deadpan] Starlight and I don't really have a lot in common. Other than feeling different from most ponies. And comedy.
724315 Comedy?
724000 [clatter]
724242 [deadpan] I'm very funny.
724315 Was that a joke?
724242 [deadpan] No.
724315 Oh. Well, that's more than I can think of that she and I have in common.
724242 [deadpan] We don't really spend that much time talking about that, though. Mostly we're just comfortable around each other.
724315 [sighs] We used to be. We did everything together. But now I'm wondering if we've spent so much time apart that we don't connect over anything anymore. And if we can't connect over anything, then maybe we're not even friends!
724242 [deadpan] Well, at least it's not serious. That was a joke.
72427c [sighs] I appreciate you trying to help, Twilight. But it seems pretty clear that Sunburst and I have grown apart.
724003 I understand. But I feel like that only happens if you both let it. You still want to be friends, right?
72427c I created a spell so we could relive playing a game in our childhood home... and bodies.
724003 Right...
72427c I'm just not sure Sunburst wants to stay friends, too.
724003 I think you might be surprised.
724000 [door opens]
724242 [deadpan] Prepare yourself...
724037 ...for the new and improved Dragon Pit!
724315 We had to take out a few spaces to get it to fit, but you hardly miss them. Maud made the dice.
724000 [die clatters]
724242 [deadpan] Pumice is the lightest igneous rock. It seemed the best choice.
724000 [die clatters]
724037 And I added the special effects. There's nothing like a little well-placed magic smoke.
724000 [poof!]
724003 Looks like somepony's dragon is going to get trapped.
72427c I thought you didn't want to play this game.
724315 Well, I didn't want to pretend to be a foal, but I know you wanted to play. I thought it'd be fun to play a version big enough for full-grown ponies. What do you think? Fun, right?
72427c Actually, it's missing something.
724000 [magic zap]
724000 [cracking]
724315 Aaaah! [grunts]
72427c [giggles] Now it's fun.
72443b [laughing]
724000 [brakes hissing]
72427c I don't know why I got so worried about us not having anything in common.
724315 Yeah. I kind of think it doesn't matter as long as we enjoy each other's company.
724037 And that game was certainly enjoyable.
72427c What made it even better was getting to play it with all my friends.
724315 See you soon?
72427c You bet. I want to hear if you find anything interesting in that barrel.
724315 Trust me, Starlight. You'll be the first to know.
724000 [train whistle blows]
724000 [train chugging]
724000 [ominous music]
724000 [credits]
72543c [narrating] The best elements within us can spread light and virtue, and I know ponies who represent them all – strength, bravery, healing, beauty, hope, and sorcery. Myself and these Pillars of Equestria were gathered together by another to maintain and share the light of these powerful ideals. But we soon came to believe the pony who brought us together only wanted that power for himself. Cast out and alone, this power-mad pony turned to darkness to satisfy his thirst. Transformed into a Pony of Shadows, he returned for revenge – to extinguish the Pillars' light and rob the world of hope. To stop him, the Pillars and I must make a grave sacrifice. But we shall leave behind a seed in hopes that one day it will grow into a force to stand against the darkness for all time. We must now face the fiend with the only plan we have...
725315 [reading] "...I only hope it will be enough." That's the last entry. And maybe Star Swirl's final words before he vanished.
725000 [theme song]
725019 I've always wondered what happened to Star Swirl. This is quite a discovery, Sunburst.
725003 So it's genuine? You can verify that this journal really belonged to Star Swirl the Bearded?!
72501a Indeed. From the looks of it, the last thing he wrote before facing the Pony of Shadows.
72500c Uh... So, the Pony of Shadows was really real?
725019 It appears so.
72501a We never met the other Pillars, and we were too young to understand the danger they faced.
725008 Hold on a second now. All those legendary ponies were real, too? And they went off with Star Swirl to face the Pony of Shadows, and then none of them were ever heard from again?
725007 Uh, yeah. Weren't you listening?
72500e But what happened to them all?
72500d They must have defeated the villain, since Equestria is still full of light and hope.
72527c But how? And where did they go?
725019 My Olde Ponish is a bit rusty, but I wonder if the answers can be found somewhere within the pages of this book.
725003 Well, I just happen to be an expert in Olde Ponish. I mean, I've practically memorized every ancient text about Star Swirl there is!
725005 Seriously. All of them.
72501a We have fond memories of our old teacher. If you could discover what happened to him, we would be most grateful.
725315 Solving a thousands-year-old mystery could take forever! Think of the research! The re-reading! The re-re-reading!
725019 You might find you need help.
725008 Luckily, she's got a whole bushel o' helpers right here.
72500c Totally! Uh... how long will all this research take, exactly?
725003 Let's get this back to my library. I'm sure we'll figure out what happened in no time.
725025 [excited chatter]
725000 [candlelight fizzles]
725005 [yawns] Figure it out yet, Twilight?
725315 [snoring]
725000 [thud]
725000 [paper rustling]
725315 [yelps] What did you figure out?
725007 [gasps] You figured something out? [slurps]
72500e What is it?
725003 [sighs] Nothing. I mean, Star Swirl was a genius, obviously. But forget Olde Ponish. There's parts where his hornwriting is like another language! [groans]
725008 Twilight, we've been studyin' and referencin' and cross-referencin' for three days straight now.
72500c Ugh. I haven't spent this much time reading since the last Daring Do book came out.
72500d Perhaps it is time to take a break. This mystery is over a thousand years old, after all. Another day or two won't make a difference.
725003 Two days?! I don't want to waste two seconds! I'm close to an answer. I can feel it.
72527c [reading] "Hearg sylfum se Ponhenge". What's that?
725003 The Temple of Ponhenge?! You can read that?!
72527c The hornwriting's pretty sloppy, but it's nowhere near as bad as mine. [reading] "Toward dol grimlic of Fola Firgenbeorg"?
725315 "At the base of Foal Mountain"...
72527c [reading] "User endemest scield".
725003 [gasps] "Our last stand".
725005 [yawns] Well, that sure sounds like a clue to me. [blows]
725003 This is it. Ponhenge. I can't believe it.
725315 I've never seen magical runes like these before! Have you?
725003 Uh-uh.
72500c I don't think anypony's seen any of this for a long time. [straining] Whoa!
725008 It'd take a whole team of ponies to clear away all this brush.
725000 [rock clatters]
72500e Even then, I'm not sure we'd find out what happened here over a thousand years ago.
725003 [sighs] You're right. I suppose it was a long shot.
725005 Cheer up, Twilight. Finding a whole set of ancient ruins is pretty impressive. Maybe you could write a paper on it.
725003 I guess I hoped we'd get here and the mystery would just magically be explained.
725000 [magic shimmering]
725005 Uh... Twilight?
725003 [gasps]
725000 [magic humming]
725003 Star Swirl!? I... I've wanted to meet you my whole life! I can't believe you're here!
725000 [low humming]
725315 I don't think he is here. I don't think any of them are.
725000 [static fizzling]
725000 [magic zap]
725000 [boom!]
725000 [boom!]
72543d [laughing evilly] You summon me at your peril, Star Swirl! Once I defeat all of you, this realm will embrace the darkness as I did so long ago! [roars]
725000 [vines snapping]
72543d [laughing evilly] Drawing me here will only make me stronger. You will never defeat me!
72543c We did not come here to defeat you.
725000 [magic shimmering]
72543d What are you doing?!
72543c We came... to contain you.
72543d [screams]
725000 [thud, poof]
725000 [magic shimmers]
725007 [to Twilight] Well, you did ask for a magical explanation.
72500c Uh... what just happened?
72527c It looked like Star Swirl cast a spell that banished the Pony of Shadows.
725315 Of course! Powerful magic like that would leave an impression on this place. Bringing the book back here let us see what happened.
725008 Which was what?
725003 Star Swirl and the rest of the Pillars sacrificed themselves to save Equestria.
72527c It's amazing to think one of the greatest mysteries of Equestria was solved with a musty old book from an antique shop.
725315 But I wouldn't say the mystery's solved. Star Swirl's spell was one of the most powerful feats of magic in all of history. It'll take years of study before we fully understand it.
725003 I think I understand Star Swirl's spell!
725003 I know I've finished one of Star Swirl's spells before, but this one was on a whole different level! Was it an explosion of magical feedback? An evocation? A kind of incantation? It's Star Swirl, so the possibilities are endless! And once Starlight set me on the right track with his crazy hornwriting – [laughs, snorts] I mean, he was a genius, so I guess we can forgive a little messiness – I went through the journal again, and it's amazing!
72500d Twilight, darling. We understand you're excited, but that's all we understand.
72500c What exactly is so amazing?
725003 Only how Star Swirl and the other Pillars sent the Pony of Shadows to limbo!
725008 They did what now?
725003 They used their magic to open a portal between worlds – to limbo – and pulled the Pony of Shadows inside.
725000 [poof!]
72500d Darling, your diorama!
725003 I made more!
725000 [clatter]
725003 Star Swirl thought the only way to trap the Pony of Shadows in limbo was for the Pillars to take him there.
725008 So they got stuck, too!
72500e The Pony of Shadows must have been really awful for them to do that.
725007 I suppose being trapped for all time with a super-duper bad guy in limbo might be okay if you were doing the limbo, but that's still pushing it.
725003 The thing is, I think I can get them out.
725315 Twilight, are you serious? You can save the most legendary ponies of all time?
72527c I-I don't know. Opening portals between worlds didn't work out well for me. Are you sure it's safe?
725003 First of all, you opened portals through time. And second of all, Star Swirl wrote the spell you used to do it. If he'd been here, he could have stopped it. Equestria would be safer with him in it. We have to save him.
725008 But you'd be savin' all the Pillars, right? A-And they disappeared ages ago.
725003 That's the thing about limbo. It isn't one place or another. It's in between, so time stands still. If we can pull them out, it'll be like they never left. I actually built another model to demonstrate—
72500c [groans]
725000 [thud]
725005 What can we do to help?
725003 If I'm right, we need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.
72500c You mean, like, stuff that belonged to them?
72500e How would we know what to look for? Or where?
725003 Luckily, Star Swirl took a lot of notes. [reading] "My compatriots are as varied as the realm itself and hail from every corner of our land, bringing with them artifacts and talismans of great power."
725000 [magic shimmering]
72527c Um, Twilight? What are you doing?
725003 I'm not doing anything!
725008 Rockhoof's shovel!
72500c Flash Magnus' shield!
72500d Mistmane's flower!
72500e Meadowbrook's mask!
725007 And the blindfold Somnambula wore when she faced that nasty sphinx!
725003 I guess we don't need to figure out who should get what.
725372 Professor! It's a Mighty Helm headpiece! Maybe it belonged to Rockhoof himself!
72543e Legends don't wear helmets. This belonged to a real pony.
725008 Oh, I can guarantee Rockhoof was as real as you and me.
72543e [chuckling] And I suppose that ravine was dug with his trusty shovel to save the village from an erupting volcano.
725008 Probably.
72543e I love old legends as much as anypony. But a pony strong enough to save a village from rushing lava with a shovel is... preposterous.
725000 [rumbling]
725000 [ponies yelping]
725008 [straining, grunts]
725000 [loud thud]
725000 [birds chirping]
72543e I can't believe you just did that. Y-You saved us!
725008 I bet if you told somepony else the story, it might sound... [gasps] "preposterous".
72543e I suppose some stories might be true...
725000 [magic humming]
72543e And Rockhoof's appears to be one of them.
725000 [gate creaking]
725000 [smack!]
72500d Ow!
72543f You keep those hooves to yourself, dearie! This place has been in my family for generations, and I'm not about to let some whippersnapper take the last good piece of it! Time was, ponies came from far and wide to see these gardens. But that flower's the only worthwhile thing left!
725000 [hedge trimmers snipping]
725000 [broom sweeping]
725000 [hedge trimmers snipping]
72500d Perhaps it just seemed like your gardens were worthless. But a little pruning can work wonders. Of course you will have to look after more than just one flower now.
72543f You've given me back my family's legacy. The flower you wanted seems like a fair trade for that.
725000 [magic humming]
72500c I can't believe Flash Magnus' shield ended up in the Dragon Lands.
725005 Good thing you brought the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons to help you navigate our customs. Like our favorite sport – gorge surfing!
725329 Wahoo! [whooping] Ollie!
725000 [dragons cheering]
72500c Okay. That was awesome.
725440 Dragon Lord Ember commanded us to make peace with ponies, but it doesn't mean you can surf in our spot.
725000 [dragons growling]
725005 Whoa, fellas. As the official Equestrian friendship ambassador to the dragons, I have to say that's not very friendly.
725170 Well, what do you know? The puny pony-dragon's sticking up for his pony pal.
72500c Hey! That's an ancient pony artifact!
725170 Hooves off my gorge board! I found it in the desert, and finders keepers.
72500c It isn't yours.
725170 Huh. It sure looks like mine. But I might consider racing you for it.
72500c No problem.
725170 Um... No. I mean [to Spike] you.
725005 [nervous chuckling]
725000 [dragons cheering]
725441 Awesome!
725170 [blows raspberry]
725005 [gulps]
725440 On your marks... Get set... Surf!
725000 [lava splashing]
725005 Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaaa! Aaah! [grunting] [painting] I won? I won! Woo-hoo! Give up the shield, Garble!
725170 [grunts] Lord Ember only commanded us to be nice to ponies. She never said anything about pony-loving dragons.
725005 Uh, s-since Dragon Lord Ember commanded you to make peace with ponies, you can't very well attack one of their friends, can you?
725170 I guess we'll find out! [grunts] Aaah!
725000 [thunk]
725170 Ugh. Why is he always hiding behind ponies?
725005 I wasn't hiding when I beat you down the ridge.
725170 You fell.
72500c Wow. You must be slow if all Spike had to do to win was fall down.
725170 I'm faster than you.
72500c Doubt it.
725170 Fine! I'll race you back to the top. If you win, you can have your pony junk. But if I win, you'll leave and I get to give it to him!
72500c Fine. I'm pretty sure I could beat you anyway. But with that heavy hunk of metal on your back, it'll be a snap.
725170 Huh? Oh, yeah. Thanks for the tip.
725000 [shield clatters]
725170 See ya at the top, loser! Hey! That's mine!
725005 Finders keepers, remember?
725440 See, because that's what you said to them when they first showed up—
725000 [thud]
725000 [flash bees buzzing]
72500e Just remember not to turn away from them, Cattail. Flash bees can get pretty aggressive. I guess that's why none of the other bayou animals can get to the water.
725000 [animals whimpering]
725421 Wouldn't it make more sense for you to wear the mask that calms the bees?
72500e It would... if I didn't have to fly up here to move their hive. There!
725000 [flash bees buzzing]
72500e Now the other bayou creatures can get to the water without the bees feeling threatened.
725000 [splashing]
725421 You know, you didn't have to help with this. I would've lent you the mask anyway.
72500e I know. [giggles] But I couldn't leave without helping.
725000 [magic humming]
725442 I don't think anypony can find anything in there.
72514e I wouldn't give up hope just yet.
725000 [slime draining]
725007 This old blindfold was stuck in the drain.
72514e Weren't you looking for a blindfold?
725007 Oh, yeah!
725000 [magic humming]
725003 I can't believe I'm gonna meet Star Swirl the Bearded! You know, outside of my dreams.
72527c I can't believe you're actually going through with it.
725003 What do you mean?
72527c I'm all for pushing the envelope, obviously, but this is pretty out there for you, Twilight.
725315 What's "out there" about saving the most legendary ponies of all time from a thousands-year-old prison?
72527c Well... nothing when you say it like that. Unless "the most legendary ponies of all time" knew what they were doing, and we shouldn't mess with it.
725315 I'm sure Star Swirl and the Pillars did the best they could back then, but magic has come a long way. Mostly because of the work they did.
72527c That's true. And you did get your wings from finishing one of Star Swirl's spells.
725003 Exactly.
72527c But then I messed with one and nearly destroyed the universe, so...
725003 Starlight, Star Swirl the Bearded is the greatest wizard who ever lived. The chance to have him back in Equestria is worth the risk.
725005 That's good news.
72500c Otherwise, we'd have brought this shield for nothing.
725008 I hope you don't think you're the only one to find her artifact, because this here shovel says otherwise.
72500d [laughing] Honestly, you two. Not everything is a competition. But Mistmane's flower is by far the most attractive of the artifacts.
725007 You're just saying that because you didn't have to scuba dive in a pit of green slime to get yours!
72500e Or move a flash beehive.
725003 Good work, everyone. Let's do this!
725000 [magic zap]
72527c [groans]
725000 [magic zaps]
725000 [magic humming]
725000 [boom!]
725000 [thuds, crashes]
72543c What... What has happened?
725003 It worked! We brought you back!
72543c To where?
725003 You and the others have been trapped in limbo for over a thousand years, but I figured out how to get you ho—
72543c What?! No, no, no, no! You must undo what you've done!
725003 What? Why? I mean, I don't think I can.
72543c You cannot bring us back!
725003 But I did. I brought all the Pillars back.
72543c You cannot bring only the Pillars back!
725000 [lightning strikes]
725000 [ponies gasp]
72543d [laughing evilly]
725003 Oh, no!
725000 [to be continued]
725000 [credits]
726000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
726315 That's the last entry. Star Swirl's final words before he vanished.
726008 All those legendary ponies were real, too? And then none of them were ever heard from again?
726003 They used their magic to open a portal to limbo.
72643d [screams]
726003 We need to find items that are connected to the Pillars in some way.
726003 We brought you back!
72643c You cannot bring only the Pillars back!
72643d [laughing evilly]
726000 [theme song]
72643d [laughing evilly] Your pitiful attempt to imprison me has failed, Star Swirl!
726000 [magic fizzles]
72643c You must return us to limbo. It's the only way to stop him.
726003 I only figured out how to bring you back.
726315 Working on it! No table of contents!
72643d Allow me to assist. [grunts]
726000 [vines lashing]
726000 [rocks breaking]
72643d There! Without the power of Ponhenge, your banishing spell is useless!
72643c You have studied my writings. Surely you have some other plan.
726003 No. I just wanted to save you. I didn't think—
72643d Don't fret. When I extinguish the light and hope of this miserable world, you won't remember any of this.
726003 No!
726000 [magic zap]
72643d Argh! This one is almost as... strong as you, Star Swirl. But even in my weakened state, she cannot stop the might of shadows! [grunts]
726000 [magic zap]
726003 [straining]
726000 [magic zap]
72627c Lucky for her, she's not alone!
72643d [straining] Arrrrggghhhh!
72643c Know this, fiend! We will not rest until we find a way to return you to limbo!
72643d [growls] Never! Your days of glory are through, Star Swirl. Now my dark power will reign, and you six will bow to me!
726000 [whoosh]
72600c Um... where'd he go?
726443 That is a riddle we must unravel. And quickly.
726423 How long have we been gone?
72600e Over a thousand years.
72643c Then my spell worked – before it was meddled with – and the realm has been at peace for a millennia!
726007 Weeeeell... we did have to save everypony from Nightmare Moon and Discord and Chrysalis and King Sombra and Lord Tirek, and there was that one time when Starlight traveled through time and almost destroyed life as we know it! But that's all in the past.
726406 If you are truly this accomplished, we will stop the Pony of Shadows twice as fast together.
72643c We shall see. It is an easy thing to say you have saved the world. It is quite another to do it.
72600c Oh, we've saved the world, Beardo. And we can do it again.
72643c Be that as it may, the problem of locating the Pony of Shadows remains, and this land is vast.
72600d It sounds like you need a map. Luckily, we have just the thing.
72643c Something about this magic seems familiar...
726000 [magic zap]
726000 [ponies gasp]
72600d Did you know he can do that?
726003 He's Star Swirl! He can do anything!
72643c This map, and indeed this very castle, are grown from the seed we planted over a thousand years ago.
7263fe Then it did work!
726315 What worked?
726443 Each of us infused a crystal seed with our magic in hopes that it would grow into a force for good.
726402 We wanted to leave something to protect the realm in our absence, but we never dreamed our gift would become so powerful.
726008 Y'all mean the Elements came from you?
726007 You know, the sparkly crystal things that grow from the Tree of Harmony and represent each of us? Laughter, honesty, generosity, loyalty, kindness, and magic!
726443 They are reflections of our own elements of hope, strength, beauty, bravery, healing, and sorcery.
726423 We had no idea our small seed would bloom into the living spirit of the land. I am glad our mantles have passed to such capable ponies.
72643c More importantly, we no longer need Ponhenge to send our foe back to limbo. We can use the stored magic in this Tree of Harmony.
726003 But doesn't a banishing spell take a lot of power? We'd have to sacrifice the Elements for that.
72643c Mm-hmm.
72600e They'd be gone... forever?
726003 Star Swirl, I don't think the Tree can survive without the Elements. If it dies, Equestria will suffer.
72643c If the Pony of Shadows has his way, your land will not exist. So unless you have a better idea...
726000 [magic zap]
72643c Our foe will seek dark places from which to draw power. I will prepare my spell so that we may strike as soon as you find him.
72600c What are we waiting for?
726406 I like your spirit!
726000 [excited chatter]
726005 What about this one?
726003 Seapony etiquette isn't going to help right now, Spike.
72627c Uh, Twilight? Are you okay?
726003 I just unleashed ultimate evil and doomed Equestria because I was obsessed with meeting my idol! Why wouldn't I be okay?!
726000 [thud]
72627c [scoffs] You didn't know that was gonna happen.
726003 But I should have listened to you and left things alone. Now the Elements of Harmony will be lost to fix my mistake!
72627c Maybe there's another way.
726005 If there is, Twilight will find it.
726003 Portal gate... Portal keys... Portal spells... Yes! If the Pillars can hold open the gateway to limbo, a powerful pony can do the banishing spell herself! Do you know what this means?
726005 [panting] I can stop carrying books?
726003 The Pillars don't have to leave Equestria! Even though we'll lose the Elements, we'll have the ponies that created them. And the Pony of Shadows will be banished for good!
72627c That's great. Heh. But I was thinking of another way that maybe doesn't involve banishing at all?
726003 Star Swirl knew what he was doing when he cast that spell. If I can make it even better, maybe he'll see that I take magic as seriously as he does.
7263fe It seems the dark places Star Swirl indicated on the map have changed.
726008 I bet the Pony of Shadows would've loved the Ghastly Caverns before a thousand years of erosion turned it into the Ghastly Gorge.
72600e The Appeloosian Wastes sure sounded dark and desolate.
72600d Who knew they would become such a popular square dancing destination?
726007 And I get how this part of Equestria used to be cast in eternal night where the Pony of Shadows could draw power and wreak havoc while ponies were powerless to stop him. But...
726000 [clang]
726007 [echoing] ...it's kinda made a comeback! Did I mention it's really bright?!
72643c It seems there are fewer dark corners in the realm these days.
72600c Isn't that a good thing?
726406 True. The Pony of Shadows will have a hard time regaining power. When he rears his head, we'll be ready!
726000 [thunk]
72600e Isn't there some way to banish him without losing all of you?
726423 Oh, I wish there were. But to save our home, we are willin' to leave it.
726003 I don't think you'll have to! My spell isn't finished yet, but I think we can send the Pony of Shadows to limbo without all of you having to go as well!
72643c While I appreciate your enthusiasm, Twilight, this is hardly the time to take risks on half-baked spells.
726003 [sighs]
726008 Beggin' your pardon, Mr the Bearded! But Twilight doesn't do anythin' halfway!
726007 Especially not magic!
72600c Seriously! She got her wings by finishing one of your spells!
72600d I think you'll find her work is worth reading before you dismiss it out of hoof!
72600e Mm-hmm!
726423 While it is an unconventional approach, I believe it could work.
72643c Hmm. I suppose there is a chance.
726315 But we still have no idea where to find the villain.
726000 [cutie marks shimmering]
726005 Maybe we should try there?
726008 The Hollow Shades. I think a branch of the Apple family lives there.
726315 They'd have to be pretty distant. The Hollow Shades was abandoned eons ago.
72600d Hmm, that's odd. The only time the map's called all of us to one place was Starlight's village.
72600c So it's like a super-villain tracker! No offense.
726003 Do you think the map could be trying to tell us where the Pony of Shadows is?
72643c Hmm... The Tree of Harmony acting to protect the light of the realm... Yes. A good thought, Twilight.
726003 [squeals]
72643c I will make my notes on this spell. Ready yourselves for battle.
72627c Uh, I know I'm not as experienced as all of you, but is banishment really the only option? I mean, it's been a long time. Maybe the Pony of Shadows is ready to talk?
72643c I doubt we can save our homeland with a conversation.
72627c But we could try.
726003 Starlight, I'm sure Star Swirl and the others did try.
72643c The Pony of Shadows was not interested in reconciliation. Once a villain, always a villain. Twilight, Sunburst, would you accompany me? I wish to refine this spell for our use.
7263fe Come. We must prepare for the struggle ahead.
72627c [sighs] I know Star Swirl is a great wizard, but this whole plan seems... wrong. The map's only ever sent us to solve friendship problems.
726005 Maybe so, but the Pony of Shadows doesn't really seem like the "friendship" type.
72627c Honestly? We don't know anything about him.
726005 Well, nopony does.
72627c That's not entirely true.
726000 [squeaking]
726000 [grinding]
72627c You all knew the Pony of Shadows before he became what he is now. You must've been friends. So what happened?
7263fe The tale of our rift is a sad one.
726444 [operatic singing]
726000 [ponies arguing]
726000 [clang!]
7263fe [narrating] Stygian was a pony like the rest of us, though more scholar than hero. He recognized our emerging world would need champions to defend it.
726445 [hisses, roars]
726444 [roaring]
726000 [magic zap]
726000 [ponies cheering]
726406 [narrating] He may have gathered us together, but he himself was just an ordinary unicorn who soon grew jealous of our abilities.
726402 [narrating] He stole objects from each of us. Artifacts to use in a spell.
726423 [narrating] And we cast him out for it.
726443 [narrating] We always thought he'd return and seek forgiveness. But when we saw him again, his heart was bent on revenge. He dashed even my hope of saving him.
726000 [magic zap]
72627c But why did he steal the artifacts from you?
726423 No doubt it was an enchantment to take our powers for himself.
72627c Hmm...
726000 [door opens]
72627c That looks like a lot of work.
72643c It is what must be done, and it would be best if we were not disturbed.
726003 I'm sorry, Starlight, but we can't stop to talk. The stakes are too high, and we have to—
72627c Banish Stygian to limbo. I get it.
726315 Uh, who?
72643c Stygian was the name the Pony of Shadows gave up when he turned to darkness.
72627c And I'm just trying to figure out why.
72643c Envy. He wanted more power than he had, and that desire led him down a path from which there is no return!
72627c I know from experience that's not always true. When the map called you six to my village, it was for a friendship problem. Are you sure this is different?
726003 I...
72643c Stygian wants to destroy all that is good in this world. There's no way to befriend a pony like that.
72627c I guess I'm lucky your idol wasn't around when you decided to be my friend. I might've been banished to limbo, too.
726000 [door closes]
726443 I am glad we have the chance to see what has grown from our efforts so long ago.
726402 It seems a shame to harm it.
72643c A necessary sacrifice. With the Elements' power, we will bind the Pony of Shadows in limbo. And thanks to Twilight, we will remain to watch over the realm ourselves.
726000 [magic humming]
7263fe Um... how do we use them?
72600d Well, you... Oh. I'm not sure. They simply work for us.
72643c The Elements are attuned to you. We must use their magic in pairs.
72600c No problem. We're used to banishing evil before breakfast.
726000 [hoof-bump]
726008 And it'll be an honor to save Equestria with y'all.
72627c I really hope Twilight knows what she's doing...
726315 I don't remember reading anything that said the Hollow Shades was like this.
726402 Ohhh. The Pony of Shadows must have twisted it to his purposes.
726000 [evil chuckle echoing]
72643c Prepare yourselves. He is here. Stygian! Show yourself and face us!
72643d [laughing evilly]
726000 [rumbling]
726000 [cracking]
726000 [ponies scream]
726315 [groans] I definitely would've remembered reading about this.
72643d [laughing maniacally] Welcome to the Well of Shade! When you turned your backs on me, I discovered this place. The darkness spoke to me of a power beyond any I could imagine, and I listened. The shadow and I became one. Soon, all of the realm will be the same. Then all ponies will feel the despair I did when you cast me out!
72643c We did what we had to do. You tried to steal our powers for yourself.
72643d No! It was you who were selfish! And now you will pay!
726000 [magic zap]
726000 [cracking]
72627c Are you still sure this isn't a friendship problem?
72643c Ready? Open the portal...
726000 [shatter!]
72643c ...Now!
726000 [magic shimmering]
726000 [wind whistling]
726000 [magic zap]
72643d No! You will not trap me again!
72643c Twilight! Push him in!
726003 Huh? There's... a pony in there.
72643d [roars]
726000 [light humming]
726003 Are you... Stygian?
726446 I was, once. Until my friends betrayed me.
726003 But Star Swirl says you betrayed them. You wanted their magic...
726446 No! I wanted their respect. I brought them together. I planned strategy, and I read all I could about the beasts we faced. But I didn't have magic or strength, so nopony ever noticed me. I went to Ponhenge to make my own copies of the artifacts. With them, I thought I could be a Pillar, too, and stand by their side in battle. I never wanted to steal their power. But instead of sharing and letting me help, my friends threw me out. [voice deepening and growling] So I became stronger than any of them! The darkness welcomed me when no pony would, and I will do what I must to protect it!
726003 This is all a misunderstanding! If the Pillars knew how you felt, I'm sure they wouldn't have turned their backs on you. The shadow isn't who you really are. Let me help you be Stygian again.
726446 Even if my friends did still care, what makes you think you have the power to help me?
72627c Because it's what she does. I wasn't so different from you, and Twilight helped me change. If there's one pony in Equestria that can save a friendship, it's her.
726446 I... I want to believe you... [growls] But the darkness will not be stopped!
726003 Aah! [grunts]
72643d Argh! [pained groans]
726003 Fight the darkness, Stygian! You don't need it anymore! Revenge isn't what you want! Friendship is!
72643d [growls]
72627c Twilight!
726000 [magic zap]
726003 [straining]
72643d [roars]
726003 Ugh! The shadow won't let go of him. He wants to stop, but he can't do it alone.
72643c Then we must help him!
726000 [magic shimmering]
72643d [roars, screams]
726000 [magic explodes]
726000 [whoosh]
726003 [grunts, sighs]
72600c Yeah! Oh, it felt sooooo good to do that again!
726007 Friendship power rush! Whoo!
72600d The Elements! They didn't disappear!
72600e Maybe because we used them for healing magic instead of banishing?
726008 Look!
72643c Long ago, you needed our help, Stygian. But instead of listening, we turned our backs on you. Pride clouded my judgment. I owe you an apology. Thank you for helping us see the errors of our ways, Twilight. It seems I never accounted for the Magic of Friendship.
726003 Thank you, Swirlstar! Uh, Star Swirl!
726000 [cutie marks shimmering]
72627c [clears throat] Soooo... apparently a conversation can save Equestria?
72643c [chuckles] Something tells me I will be making a lot of apologies today.
72643c I simply cannot believe how tall you've gotten!
726019 Well, it has been over a thousand years. Will you stay here and teach magic once again? My sister and I have such fond memories of your lessons.
72601a As long as you don't ask for those essays we owed you before you disappeared.
726019 [giggles]
72643c [chuckles] I'm not certain Canterlot is where I belong. The realm has grown, and I believe I'll have a look around before I settle in any one place.
726423 And I long to see what has become of my home.
726402 I believe we all do.
726019 Then I hope you will return to Canterlot on occasion and share the wisdom of your great experience with the next generation of ponies.
72643c We would be honored. But if it is wisdom you seek, look no further than your own pupil. She showed me that the power of friendship is a magical force indeed. And that in turning away from others, you hurt yourself as well.
726003 It's funny. I thought meeting my idol would give me all the answers I ever wanted. But instead, I forgot what I already knew. Good thing I had a student of my own to remind me.
726000 [credits]
801003 This happened while we were gone?
801008 Wow! Those are all the places we went when we left to save Equestria!
80100d Ugh! There's that horrid town where we were almost sold!
80100c The pirates! They were pretty awesome! Uh, once they decided not to throw us overboard.
801007 And Mount Aris! Ooh, Starlight! Did you know we made seashell necklaces for aaaaaa... [inhales] ...aaaaall the seaponies?
80127c I... You... Really? What about that unicorn? The one who attacked Canterlot?
801003 Tempest! I invited her to come to Ponyville, but she wanted to spread the word of the Storm King's defeat and share what she learned about friendship.
801008 Y'all think that's why the map grew? Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
80100e I hope not. I've had quite enough life-threatening adventures, thank you very much.
801000 [squeaking]
801007 How many friendship quests do you think we need to go on before we have to expand the throne room?
801003 We can't do it all alone.
801007 Sure we can! We just need to knock this wall down, get some paint...
801003 No. I mean, the world is filled with so many different creatures who know nothing about friendship. We need help if we're gonna teach them all about friendship. Lots of help.
80100d Perhaps. But where does one go to learn about friendship?
801003 Here! They can all go here! Because we're gonna open a school!
801000 [theme song]
801019 I think a school of friendship is a wonderful idea, Twilight! I'll help in any way I can.
801000 [scribbling]
801003 I just have a few questions. What time should school start each day?
801019 It really d—
801003 What's the ideal length for class? Do you test regularly?
801019 Oh, well, that's—
801003 What about class projects?
801019 That's a very—
801003 Assigned seating? Open seating? Or is that... too unstructured?
801019 [giggles] Oh, Twilight. You were my star pupil. If anyone knows how to run a school, it's you.
801003 There's a big difference between attending a school and running one. It's not like there's a rule book to follow.
801019 Actually, there is. The EEA guidebook is very specific about how to run a school.
801003 The EEA? I've never heard of that. Should I have heard of that?!
801019 Of course not. You've never run a school before. The Equestria Education Association is a board of learned ponies that oversee every school in Equestria.
801005 Even your school? But you're you!
801019 Not even a princess can do whatever she likes when it comes to shaping young pony minds. The EEA ensures that whether it's unicorns studying magic, Pegasi learning weather, or Earth ponies researching agriculture, all schools are held to the same high standard. They'll need to approve your plan before you can move forward.
801003 Okay, Spike, looks like we have a presentation to make.
801005 [scoffs] After everything we've been through, how hard can that be?
801000 [deep chord]
801005 I'm gonna go with "really hard".
801003 Uh, hello. My name is—
801447 Princess Twilight Sparkle. I am Chancellor Neighsay. Equestria owes you a great debt. But princess or no, we expect you to do things by... the... book!
801000 [thud]
801000 [pages flipping]
801003 I think you'll find my curriculum meets all your requirements, Chancellor.
801000 [pages flipping]
801447 And can we trust you to follow through with this plan? Will you leave the school unattended to gallop off on your... "adventures"?
801003 My journey beyond Equestria showed me firsthoof that the threats out there are greater than we imagined!
801000 [EEA members hushed whispering]
801003 If we want to keep our land safe and create a friendlier tomorrow, we need to teach the Magic of Friendship far and wide.
801447 A school for ponies to learn how to protect themselves.
801003 Uh, more like respecting differences and communicating.
801000 [long pause]
801447 The EEA concurs. Every pony should be prepared to defend our way of life. So, if your work is in order, provisional EEA approval is granted. We will need to observe your school up and running before it can be fully accredited.
801003 Then please, join us for Friends and Family Day. It'll be the perfect time to see our progress!
801000 [stamp]
801000 [various glints]
801000 [splashing]
80100c It's too much. Too much!
80100d Ugh, you think so? I had hoped dressing the part would help me feel the part.
80100c Not your dress! This! Us! Teaching?! They're gonna think I'm an egghead!
801007 Well, the students are gonna love my confetti cannon class. It's gonna be... a blast!
801000 [party cannon squeak]
80100e Um, hello there. I'm your teacher. I hope you enjoy class. But if you don't enjoy it, that's okay, too.
801008 I don't know about all this.
801003 It's going to be fine. Everything about this school just feels right.
80127c See? If Twilight isn't stressed, you've got nothing to worry about.
801008 And you're sure you want us to be teachers? In classrooms?
801003 The EEA is very clear on how schools should be run. We have a huge responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book. That means no cannons in class, Pinkie.
801007 Awww. Not even a [high-pitched] teeny cannon?
801000 [tiny party cannon fires]
801003 I know it's not some big adventure against the forces of evil, but this could be the most important thing we've ever done. I can't run a school of friendship without my best friends. Can I count on you?
80100d Of course you can, darling.
80100c Call me Professor Egghead. I'm in!
801000 [bell rings]
801007 [screams] First day at school! So many new ponies!
801003 About that. One thing I forgot to mention. It's not just ponies.
801000 [students chattering]
801007 That was unexpected.
80100d Ooh! Students certainly traveled from far and wide to attend our school!
801003 Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms. After all, friendship is something that needs to be shared with every... creature.
801000 [magic zap]
801000 [ponies chattering]
801003 Welcome to the School of Friendship! I'm your headmare Twilight Sparkle. Please follow Guidance Counselor Starlight to sign in and get your class assignments. Then we can show you your living quarters.
801000 [thump]
801188 Whoa, sorry! I'm Sandbar. Are you a student here, too?
801184 [sarcastically] No, I just figured I'd randomly stand here and see how many ponies would walk into me. [huffs]
80129e Gallus! [wheezes]
80100c Grandpa Gruff? What are you doing here?
80129e Flew all the way from Griffonstone to introduce Gallus.
801184 Rainbow Dash, right? Gilda told me about you. You're a teacher? Huh. Thought you'd be... cooler.
801000 [door slams]
8012b4 Ponies!
801007 Prince Rutherford!
8012b4 This Yona Yak. She come to pony school. Hah. Make it better.
801187 Yak can't wait to meet ponies and tell all about Yakyakistan!
801000 [ponies screaming]
801187 [yelps]
801000 [thud]
801000 [crash]
801008 Why don't I show you around before you destroy the place?
801186 But dragons are better than this! Why am I here?
8013f6 Because as Dragon Lord, I'm ordering you to be here! Hey, Spike! Come meet Smolder.
801005 Great to see you, Ember! Uh, which one is Smolder?
801000 [beat]
801361 Ocellus! What did we talk about?
801000 [changeling zap]
801361 I told you, stay in your own form. It's the polite thing to do. Sorry, she's shy.
801185 What is that?! No way! I didn't know ponies could turn into... um... What are you?
801361 A changeling.
801185 Ponies can turn into changelings?!
80100e No, but changelings can turn into ponies.
801185 Huh. That's confusing!
801000 [changeling zap]
801448 I am General Seaspray of Her Majesty Queen Novo's navy. I would like to introduce the queen's niece, Silverstream.
801185 This place is amazing! I've spent most of my life in a coral reef underwater. I was a seapony, but now I'm a Hippogriff. Long story. Anyway, wow! Is that a yak?!
801000 [ponies chattering]
801003 Thank you so much for supporting the grand opening of our school. I hope you'll all join us for Friends and Family Day to see the amazing progress your students are making.
801000 [cheering]
801003 Looks like school's in session!
801000 [Choir]
801000 The School of Friendship, first day of class
801000 Will we fail or will we pass?
801000 Students come from far and wide
801000 Brand-new friends here by our side
801003 [Twilight Sparkle]
801003 Take a breath, look around, it's amazing
801003 I can't believe that it's real
801003 Students galore, new ideas to explore
801003 Can't contain the excitement I feel
801003 Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now
801003 Think "success", keep it firmly in sight
801003 Make sure to do things by the book
801003 Make sure to do it all right
801000 [Choir]
801000 The School of Friendship, must get to class
801000 Will we fail or will we pass?
801000 Students learning from the best
801000 Taking notes to pass the test
801003 [Twilight Sparkle]
801003 Wait, hold on! Not like that! Just a second!
801003 I'm not sure if that method's approved
801003 Let me take a look – yup, right here in the book
80100c [Rainbow Dash]
80100c Come on! We just got in the groove!
801003 [Twilight Sparkle]
801003 Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now
801003 We are shaping young minds to ignite
801003 Do it like it says in the book
801003 Now make sure you're doing it right
801007 [Pinkie Pie]
801007 There's not an equation on how to have fun
80100e [Fluttershy]
80100e The students look bored now – oh, what have I done?
801008 [Applejack]
801008 Can't teach bein' honest, not sure what to do
80100d [Rarity]
80100d I'm quite certain I'm lost
801025 [Mane Six except Twilight Sparkle]
801025 None of us has a clue!
801183 [Young Six]
801183 School of Friendship, another class
801183 Wish it were more of a blast
801183 Thought this school would be more fun
801183 Can't wait for our classes to be done
801183 School of Friendship
801003 [Twilight Sparkle]
801003 Can't mess up, can't afford a mistake now
801007 [Pinkie Pie]
801007 No way to have fun
80100e [Fluttershy]
80100e Oh, what have I done?
801183 [Young Six]
801183 Bored with this class
801003 [Twilight Sparkle]
801003 Think "success", keep it firmly in sight
801183 [Young Six]
801183 Wish that we could leave en masse!
801025 [Mane Six except Twilight Sparkle]
801025 We don't have a clue
801183 [Young Six]
801183 Listen to this one request
801183 Make things fun, we're really stressed
801003 [Twilight Sparkle]
801003 Make sure to do things by the book now
801472 [All except Twilight Sparkle]
801472 Can we tell her this thing is a mess?
801000 [students groaning]
801185 Is this what boring is? Am I bored?
801186 Ugh, please. These ponies are the heroes of Equestria?
801188 Listen, these ponies saved all of us from the Storm King.
801184 How? By boring him into surrender?
801189 Our teachers are a little different than I expected.
801187 Ugh! Pony school waste of time! Yak school teach how to braid yak hair! Braiding yak hair is best! Whoa!
801000 [thud]
801186 Oof! Is there anything in Yakyakistan that isn't the best?
801187 Yes! Wait. No! Yaks best.
801186 No claws, no wings, no fire. What is it exactly you're proud of?
801188 Whoa, cool it. No need to harsh Yona's love for her heritage, okay?
801184 Awww, are we not being sweet and friendly enough for you, pony?
801185 That was sarcasm, right? Because you weren't being sweet or nice!
801186 Maybe dragons and griffons are just too tough for friendship.
801187 Yaks tough, just not nasty.
801184 Who you calling nasty, klutz?
801449 [grunting]
80100c Okay, break it up! Break... it... up!
80127c What is going on here?!
801184 Just a friendly discussion about the magic of friendship amongst friends.
801008 Everypony— I mean, everyone, go to your next class! I just can't believe it. Fights breakin' out when they're supposed to be learnin' friendship?
80127c Things definitely aren't going as "by the book" as Twilight planned.
80100c That's because we're terrible teachers! Face it. This school isn't gonna work.
801008 [fading in] ...fights breakin' out in the hallway...
801000 [other main characters talking over each other]
801007 ...putting myself to sleep!
80100c I don't look like that, do I?
801007 [snores]
801003 I get it. Things are getting off to a rougher start than expected. But that's okay!
801005 Who are you, and what have you done with Twilight Sparkle?
801003 Every school in Equestria follows these rules. As long as we do too, we'll be fine.
80127c Maybe we should... try something new?
801003 The EEA will be here this afternoon for Friends and Family Day. They need to see a school that follows their guidelines.
80100e Even if those guidelines aren't working?
801003 Well, then we have to try harder and make sure they do.
801000 [bell rings]
801003 Another morning, another chance to inspire our students!
801000 [door opens]
801188 Hey! Professor Dash's class is this way.
801189 Where are you going? You're not [gasps] skipping, are you?
801186 That's exactly what we're doing.
801185 But Friends and Family Day—
801184 Is after class. Relax. This is just a quick... mental health break.
80144a [whispering]
801185 That sounds legit! We're in!
801188 I guess I'll tag along, too. Make sure you don't get into... trouble.
801000 [students giggling]
80100e This way, Angel!
801185 Professor Fluttershy! We're busted!
801000 [changeling zap]
80100e Oh, my! What are you all doing? Aren't classes that way?
801189 Ah— [clears throat] A generosity field trip, daaaaarling. [giggles] I'm taking the students to the lake to look at our divine reflections.
801000 [beat]
80100e Oh, that sounds nice. Have fun!
801040 [growls]
801000 [changeling zap]
801000 [students giggling]
801186 I take back everything I said about you! That was cool!
801189 Thanks! Wait, what did you say about me?
801000 [students giggling]
80127c You're sure sticking to the book is gonna work?
801003 My friends can handle anything. They'll have these problems turned around before we know it.
801447 Problems?
801314 [gasps]
801003 Chancellor Neighsay! You're here!
801447 Yes. And you seem unprepared. If there are problems...
801000 [scribbling]
801003 Problems? Ha! Of course not! We can't wait to show you around!
801000 [scribbling]
801003 [chuckles nervously]
801184 And that's why griffons breathe fire when we get mad.
801185 They do not! Wait! Do they? No! Really?!
801187 Griffons just full of hot air!
801000 [students laughing]
801186 And yaks are actually good at jokes. How about that?
801189 What are dragons good at?
801186 Competition! Who's up for a race?
801000 [skidding brakes]
801003 Rainbow Dash! Why aren't you in class teaching?
80100c Because my students are gone! Uh, g-gone somewhere else! Doing a loyalty lesson! And-and I was just going to grab, uh... this pencil! Because they need it. Wherever they are. Which I know, 'cause... I'm the teacher!
801003 I see. [laughs nervously] Well, Chancellor, we have other classes. We can just—
801447 Let's follow the professor. I'm quite curious about this lesson in loyalty.
801000 [students laughing]
801003 [voiceover] Of course, we want to instill a sense of loyalty towards others. We encourage acts of generosity and kindness.
801000 [students yelping]
801184 Figured we shouldn't be the only ones enjoying the view.
801187 Waaaah! Yak not best at flying!
801003 [voiceover] And appreciation for the value of laughter...
801187 Flying is best!
801185 Congratulations, Yona! You are officially the weirdest thing I've seen so far!
801186 What do you say, Ocellus? Can you be weirder than a flying yak?
801000 [changeling zap]
801000 [other students gasping]
801003 ...and to always be honest in any situation.
801447 Honesty is imperative. Princess, are we going in circles?
801003 Uh, look at the time! We'd better head to the lake for Friends and Family Day. I'm sure all the students and faculty will be there.
801000 [ponies chattering]
8012b4 [laughs]
801000 [clink]
801000 [buzzing noise]
8013f6 What is that?!
801000 [shocked noises and screams]
801447 Aah! The school is under attack!
801184 [grunts]
801000 [spinning]
80144b [gasps]
801187 [screams]
801000 [splat]
801034 Oh, my goodness!
801000 [changeling zap]
801000 [crunch]
801000 [all coughing]
801185 Uh, maybe skipping class wasn't the best idea?
801447 How dare you! This act of aggression against ponies—!
801003 I-I'm so sorry, Chancellor. We clearly had some students get a little carried away.
801447 Those are students? But you said you were opening this school to protect Equestria! To defend ponies from... dangerous creatures who don't have our best interests at heart!
801003 My school teaches for all of us to work together through friendship.
801447 And how do you know these creatures won't take what they have learned here and use it against us?
801003 Friendship isn't just for ponies!
801447 It should be.
8012b4 Unicorn think yaks no need friendship? Maybe yaks no need pony school!
801447 Well, perhaps you should return to your kind.
8013f6 "Your kind"?! Smolder, let's go!
801448 Queen Novo will want to hear of this!
80129e Well, this place seemed lame anyways.
801361 [despondently] It's fine. We know not every pony sees us the way you do. We're used to it.
801003 Princess Celestia helped me reach out to all the kingdoms! When she hears you closed the school because—!
801447 Because you failed to meet the EEA's standards?
801003 What?!
801447 Irresponsible teachers, students skipping class, endangering ponies! Your school is a disaster. Perhaps if you had had higher standards for who was admitted, this could have been avoided. Regardless...
801000 [magic noises]
801000 [chains rattling]
801447 By order of the EEA, I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!
801003 [sad gasp]
801000 [To be continued...]
801000 [credits]
802000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
802003 This happened while we were gone?
802008 Friendship quests beyond Equestria?
802003 We're gonna open a school!
802447 We expect you to do things by... the... book!
802003 We have a huge responsibility, and I need you all to do this by the book.
802186 These ponies are the heroes of Equestria?
802184 This is just a quick... mental health break.
802447 The school is under attack!
802447 Those are students?
802447 I am shutting this school... [stomps] down!
802003 [sad gasp]
802000 [theme song]
802000 [phonograph playing sad music]
802000 [door opens]
802005 Twilight? You feeling okay?
802003 [muffled groan]
802000 [click, sad music stops]
802003 [incoherent groan]
802005 [sighs] Look on the bright side. Sure, the EEA closed your friendship school. But now you've got time to do other stuff! It's like being on vacation!
802000 [flumph]
802005 Whoa!
802003 A failure vacation! I'm supposed to be the Princess of Friendship! And all I did was make enemies with Equestria's allies, upset my friends, and get my school... [eye twitches] ...unaccredited! There is no bright side! [blows nose]
802005 Okay, then. I'm gonna need backup. Operation Cheer-Up is a go!
802000 [whoosh]
80200c Come on, Twilight! You can't sit around in the boring dark all day!
802008 Exactly! What you need is a double dose of Granny Smith's apple mash.
802000 [beat]
80200e Whenever I'm sad, a hug from Angel Bunny always makes me feel better.
802040 [squeaks] [whimpers]
80200e Oh! Uh... Maybe it's just me. [laughs nervously]
80200d I find that nothing brightens my mood like a new ensemble!
802003 [sighs, still tearing up] Thanks, Rarity. It's a great dress... [sobs] for somepony who knows how to run a school! [blows nose]
802007 [whispering, to Spike] You didn't tell me this was a pity party! I would've brought ice cream!
802003 I appreciate you trying to make me feel better, but not everything can be fixed with dresses and cupcakes.
80200d [gasps]
802007 What?!
802003 I just need some time to be alone and think.
802000 [doors close]
802000 [waterfall rushing]
802003 Oh...
80227c I wondered how long you'd take to get tired of pillow-fort pouting.
802003 Everypony's already tried to cheer me up. It won't work.
80227c [short laugh] I'm not gonna cheer you up. I'm gonna tell you what you did wrong.
802003 What?!
80227c You gave up too easily.
802000 [beat]
80227c Hey, you made me a guidance counselor. That means tough love.
802003 Neighsay was right. I failed. The school was a disaster.
80227c So was I when you met me. But you showed me that when you know in your heart something is right, you stand up for it. You did that for me. Why not for this?
802003 I can't go against the EEA! They're in charge of all the schools in Equestria!
80227c And you're in charge of all the friendship in Equestria. Why should you let somepony else stop you from doing your job?
802003 But the EEA rulebook—
802000 [splash]
80227c Doesn't matter! You can write your own rules! Because you are doing something new. Something important!
802003 You're right! Why we're doing this is way more important than how we're doing this! And we are doing this!
80227c Now, that's the Twilight I know. How can I help?
802003 You already have.
802000 [door opens]
802003 Guess what? The School of Friendship is back in business!
80200c What?!
80200d But why?!
80200e Oh, no.
802008 Bad idea.
802007 Do we still get to guess?
80200c No offense, Twilight, but teaching at that school was the most boring, horrible, awful thing ever.
802008 Uh, pretty sure she's gonna take offense to that.
802003 No, Rainbow Dash is right. I owe you all an apology. I was so focused on doing things the EEA way, I didn't listen to any of you. I'm sorry. I promise, this time, we'll run the school the way friends should – together.
80200d So... we'd be allowed to teach however we want to?
80200e No more scary pop quizzes?
802007 Confetti cannons for everycreature?
802000 [party cannons clanking]
802003 Whatever you need to teach the Elements of Harmony.
802007 Yippeeeee!
802000 [party cannons fire]
802008 Well, in that case, we're behind you one hundred percent, Twilight.
802005 [clears throat] Just two small problems. The school is still unaccredited...
802003 [eye twitches]
802005 ...and we don't have any students.
802003 I'll take care of the first part if you five can round up our class.
80200c Totally! Uh... how?
802008 Roundin' up the pony students ain't gonna be an issue, but...
80200e The creatures from the other kingdoms seemed pretty upset with us.
80200d Pfft! Nonsense! I'm certain we can win them over with our charm and style!
802007 [singsongy] Cupcake-gram for Prince Rutherfoooord!
8022b4 Why pink pony here? Yaks mad at ponies!
802007 Because... you don't have to be mad anymore! We're reopening Twilight Sparkle's School of Friendship! And it's gonna be super-uper-duper better than before! We're—
80200d —ever so sorry about the misunderstanding. All creatures are, of course, welcome.
80200e We would be really happy if you sent your student back to class.
802008 It won't be the same without 'em. We're open and ready to start teachin'—
80200c —right now! So, what are you waiting for? Get your student and let's go!
80229e Not happenin'!
80200c [groans] Do you need me to do the whole apology and explanation thing again? Okay. [inhales]
80229e Listen, missy! It's not happenin' because—
80244c [simultaneously] Our student is gone!
802018 [simultaneously] What?!
8022b4 Where Yona?! This all pony's fault!
8023f6 You're pretty quick to blame them! What are you hiding, yak?!
8022b4 [snorts]
802361 C-Can... Can we just focus on finding our lost students?
80229e Nice try! You grubs are probably hidin' the whole lot of 'em!
802019 Please, everycreature! If you can just explain what happened...
802448 The students left us notes before they disappeared. When the school closed, they didn't want to say goodbye to each other. They claim they ran away to stay together.
802003 I can't believe it! They did learn friendship!
802000 [beat]
802003 Sorry.
802448 The students couldn't have done this by themselves. Some creature is hiding them! If the niece of our queen is not found soon, I promise there will be retribution!
8023f6 Yeah? Well, my dragons will burn every kingdom until we find which of you is hiding Smolder!
80229e Tell it to the griffon army!
8022b4 Yaks fight griffons and dragons!
802361 The Changeling Empire can't afford an international incident. If any creature blames the changelings for this—
8023f6 What are you up to, shapeshifter?!
802361 B-But we're friends!
802019 Find the students quickly, Twilight, or I fear our world will be at war!
802003 Okay. Let's review what we know.
802005 Smolder, Ocellus, Silverstream, Yona, and Gallus disappeared together.
802000 [beat]
802005 That's all we know.
802008 They're probably just off hidin' somewhere.
80227c Unless they used some kind of spell to disappear.
80200c Ooh! Or went undercover!
802007 Maybe they were attacked by a ferocious shrimp! Nopony ever expects that!
80200e [gasps] Shrimps can attack?
802007 Nope! That's why nopony expects it.
802000 [door opens, bell rings]
802188 Whoa!
802007 Hi, Sandbar! Are you having a party?
802188 [incredibly nervously] No! I'm just, um... really hungry? Yeah?
802007 [squee]
80200d We need to think like our students. If someone told us we would never see each other again, what would we do?
802007 Go someplace we could all hang out and eat lots and lots of cupcakes!
802000 [beat]
802007 What?
80200e Sandbar was friends with all of the missing students... and he just got plenty of cupcakes.
802008 Huh. He was at the farm this mornin' pickin' up a wagonload of apples...
80200d And I saw him in a shop buying pillows and blankets!
80200c [gasps] He must be taking all that stuff to the other students! We've gotta follow him!
802000 [smack]
802184 [laughing] Huh. This place is way cooler than I thought it'd be.
802000 [thud]
802186 [chewing] Even I'm impressed. What's it called again, Ocellus?
802189 The Castle of the Two Sisters. I remembered it from class. Princess Twilight's "History of Pre-Equestrian Friendships".
802184 Huh. Who knew? School was actually good for something.
802187 Yona not really like school. But Yona like new friends!
802186 [grunts] [strained] Smolder... like breathing!
802185 Hey, you guys! Sandbar's back!
802000 [thump]
802000 [door opens]
802187 Cupcakes are best cakes!
802188 Aah!
802187 [panting]
802188 [sighs] Thanks for the assist, Gallus.
802184 [scoffs] I was saving the cupcakes. [chewing]
802189 Pillows! How nice! The castle is gonna be so much more comfy.
802186 And fun! Pillow fight!
80244d [grunting and laughing]
802000 [buzzing]
802000 [thump]
802000 [students laughing]
802185 You guys! I just found stairs!
802000 [beat]
802184 Aaaand we care because...?
802185 Stairs are awesome! We don't have anything like 'em underwater, 'cause you know, [magic zap] no way to climb 'em!
80244e Ohhhh.
802000 [magic zap]
802185 This place has everything! If only my family back home could see it...
802000 [thump]
802185 [chewing]
802189 I wish the other changelings could meet you all. You're not nearly as strange as the stories say.
802186 Gee, thanks. But yeah, hanging out with other creatures is actually... not bad.
802000 [rustling]
802000 [thump]
802188 Uh, most other creatures. What is that thing?
802189 [sighs] Am I the only one who didn't sleep through Professor Fluttershy's "Critters of Comfort and Conflict" class? It's a puckwudgie. Maybe I can make friends with it!
802000 [changeling zap]
802189 [puckwudgie noises]
802000 [puckwudgie growls]
802000 [more puckwudgies growling]
802000 [changeling zap]
802189 Oops.
802187 Yak plan better. [screams battlecry]
802000 [needles flying]
802000 [thunk]
802000 [puckwudgie snarling]
802000 [needles flying]
802000 [puckwudgie noises]
802000 [puckwudgie noises]
802186 [grunts]
802000 [needles flying]
802000 [flumph]
802186 Think, Ocellus! Did Professor Fluttershy say anything about how to beat puckwudgies in her lecture?!
802189 Uh... I'm sorry, I can't remember!
802184 I'm gonna go ahead and guess it's not pillows, apples—
802000 [needles flying]
802184 ...or cupcakes.
802185 Wouldn't class have been about how to make friends with them?
802188 Uh, guys? They're getting really close...
802187 Yona not scared! Yona have friends!
802000 [puckwudgies gnashing]
802000 [whoosh]
802184 Is that Professor Egghead?!
802000 [magic noises]
802005 Aw, yeah!
802000 [puckwudgie noises]
80200e Oh! Don't hurt them! Just ask them to leave nicely.
802000 [thunk]
802000 [fuse burning]
802000 [party cannon fires]
802000 [fireworks exploding]
802187 Not bad! [quickly] For pony.
802189 Wow! They're amazing!
802184 I had no idea our teachers were actually cool.
802188 [chuckles] I've been trying to tell you!
802185 Did you see that?! Rainbow Dash was like voooooom and then werrrrr, and the puckwudgies went flying! And then the birds came and—!
802186 Yeah, we all just lived it. But you're right. That was pretty amazing. Even by dragon standards.
802000 [puckwudgie noises]
802003 Is everycreature alright?
802183 [general agreement]
802005 [panting] You're lucky we got here in time!
80227c You know, this probably isn't the safest place for a campout.
802189 Does that mean you're going to send us back to our homes?
802003 Not exactly. We have another option in mind.
802184 We're listening.
802003 It's pretty clear you've already started learning friendship without your teachers. But we'd like to show you even more... if you'd come back to school?
802186 Not much of a choice.
802008 To be honest, we felt exactly the same way when Twilight told us she was reopening the school.
80200d But this time, we guarantee it shall be different.
80200c Oh, yeah! With class run my way, it'll be two hundred and twenty percent cooler.
80200e And without the EEA—
802000 [puckwudgie noise]
80200e —it'll be much friendlier.
802007 Plus, all your nations won't go to war if you come back with us! Bonus!
802000 [beat]
802188 Wait. What's happening?
802000 [magic noises]
802019 Twilight! I was so relieved to get your letter!
802448 As was Queen Novo. Oh, we're just glad you're alright, Silverstream!
80229e [to Gallus] Don't expect a welcome party from me, sonny! It's time you got home!
802000 [smack]
802184 I'm not leaving.
80229e Whaaaat?!
802189 None of us are. Sorry, Thorax.
8022b4 Yak not understand. This pony joke?
802186 No. We're going back to school.
8023f6 How? You can't even get inside!
802000 [magic noises]
802000 [chains shattering]
802003 School is back in session!
802183 [cheering]
802000 [magic warbling]
802447 Who dared remove my seal?
802003 I did, Chancellor Neighsay! And I respectfully ask you to step aside, or classes will start late.
802447 Classes won't start at all! The EEA has spoken, and none shall pass!
802000 [boom!]
802187 Yak pass if yak say! Hmph!
802447 This is for the greater good. The school was disorganized, the teachers unqualified! And those dangerous and unpredictable "students" put ponies' lives in danger!
8022b4 [growls]
8023f6 [growls] I'll show you unpredictable!
80244c [shouting]
802019 Hold on, please! I'm sure Princess Twilight Sparkle has a good explanation for all of this.
802003 I do! It's true that my School of Friendship is EEA-unaccredited...
802005 Look! She said it without doing the eye thing!
802447 Then it is not a school!
802003 It's not an EEA school. It's a friendship school with its own rules. I should know. I wrote the book!
802000 [thump]
802003 These students reminded me that every friendship is special, so the way we teach it has to be just as unique. My school is going to do things differently.
802447 Allowing all of these creatures to attend your school, changing the rules for them – it simply won't work!
802019 I seem to recall something about Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi doing something similar, don't you?
802003 I promise you, Chancellor. My school will help protect Equestria.
802447 Or destroy it!
802000 [magic noise]
802000 [students cheering]
80229e Hmph. How is this school going to be any different from last time?
802003 [Twilight Sparkle]
802003 This brand new school of friendship
802003 Is home to everyone
802189 [Ocellus]
802189 We're learning how to trust
802184 [Gallus]
802184 We're here to all have fun
80200d [Rarity]
80200d With friendship ties that bind us
802008 [Applejack]
802008 Tighter than the strongest bonds
80200e [Fluttershy]
80200e We're hoof-in-hoof
80204d [All]
80204d In hand in hoof in wing or even claw
802003 [Twilight Sparkle]
802003 There's a griffon in the garden
80200c [Rainbow Dash]
80200c Hippogriffs hang in the hall
802005 [Spike]
802005 And the door will be open
802005 To all creatures great and small
802007 [Pinkie Pie]
802007 And a yak or two or three
8022b6 [Yaks]
8022b6 Sing in perfect harmony
80227c [Starlight Glimmer]
80227c That might have been a changeling
80200e [Fluttershy]
80200e But it kind of looks like me
80204d [All]
80204d This school of friendship is for all of us
80204d A place where we belong
80204d Where we all learn to share and trust
80204d The only rule here is to find your way
80204d And friendship always wins at the end of the day
802003 [Twilight Sparkle]
802003 Some things you just can't teach with books
802003 Some things you only know
802003 So trust your heart and let us lead
802003 And your friendship's sure to grow
802183 [Young Six]
802183 And once we master kindness
802183 We will spread it 'cross this land
80204d [All]
80204d And give the gift that's ours to share
80204d So others understand
80204d This school of friendship is for all of us
80204d A place where we belong
80204d Where we all learn to share and trust
80204d The only rule here is to find your way
80204d And friendship always wins at the end of the day!
8023f6 Ugh, fine! If you promise to stop singing, Smolder can stay!
802186 Wahoo!
8022b4 Uh, if dragon stay, yak stay.
802361 I know you will make the changelings proud, Ocellus.
802448 You belong here. Now, can you show me those stair things you mentioned?
802185 [incoherent excited noises]
80229e [to Gallus] What? You belong at home! You think I care if you've made friends?
802184 Please, Grandpa Gruff? [whimpers]
80229e Alright, alright! Stop doing that!
802000 [students cheering]
80227c Guess I make a pretty good guidance counselor, huh?
802003 Yes! Writing the rulebook was the most fun ever! I can't wait to start working on the new lesson plans!
802008 [clears throat]
802003 ...with some help from my friends.
802000 [credits]
803079 Puh-leeeez put your hooves together for your next performer, Maud Pie!
803000 [applause]
803242 [taps on microphone] [deadpan] What do you call an Alicorn with no wings and no horn?
803000 [beat]
803242 Earth pony.
803007 [laughs]
803242 [deadpan] But seriously, being an Earth pony isn't so bad. We've got magic powers, too. Like walking around and picking stuff up with our teeth.
803000 [confused murmuring]
803242 [deadpan] That's sarcasm, by the way.
803007 [laughs] It's funny, 'cause it's true!
803242 [deadpan] My favorite thing to listen to is clastic rock – the accumulation of sediments over millennia forming to create sandstone, shale, and breccia. It sounds something like this.
803000 [feedback]
803000 [beat]
803242 [deadpan] And that's my time.
803007 [laughs] Isn't my sister Maud the most hilarious, entertaining, amazing comedian ever?
803000 [beat, ponies burst into uproarious laughter]
803000 [theme song]
803007 Your jokes, your hilarious delivery, your... your everything!
803242 [deadpan] How was my... timing?
803007 [laughing] You got me! C'mon, let's celebrate sister-style. We can get matching stickers that says "Eyes on the Pies", then show them off at the Ponyville Sticker Convention that I could plan for tomorrow if you want.
803242 [deadpan] Actually, I'm busy tonight.
803007 Aww, that's what you said yesterday. And the day before that. And the day before the day before that. [sighs] It's just, we haven't hung out in a really long time because you always have other plans. Even when you promised to build whipped-cream pyramids with me.
803000 [spraying]
803242 [deadpan] I know. I am sorry, Pinkie. The reason is I have a—
803007 Apology accepted, as long as we get some serious sister time before your birthday. And there's, uh, definitely no reason I wanna hang out before your birthday. Just, you know, not planning anything special.
803242 [deadpan] Okay.
803007 What about tomorrow morning?
803242 [deadpan] Okay.
803007 Yay! Just you and me. Best sister friends forever!
803242 [deadpan] Best sister friends forever.
803007 I can't wait for tomorrow to be today. [extended squeal]
803007 [continues squealing] Tomorrow is today! Who's ready for some fun times at Sugarcube Corner? The answer is "you"! I would also accept "Maud". Maud? Maud!
803000 [echoes]
803007 [gasps] Oh, I get it! We're playing hide-and-go-seek!
803000 [music]
803000 [barrel clattering]
803000 [splashing]
803000 [zoom]
803000 [thud]
803000 [knock, knock, knock, knock]
803000 [door opens]
803007 Aha! Found you!
803000 [crash]
803000 [clattering]
803007 Where's Maud? I've already tried Discord's dimension, Granny Smith's wax museum, and Yakyakistan! She has to be here!
80327c Nope, it's just me. Reading.
803000 [pages flipping]
803007 Story checks out. Or does it?! It does. But are you sure there's nopony hiding... in your closet?!
80327c Pinkie, I don't have a closet. Is everything okay?
803007 No. I was supposed to go birthday cake shopping with Maud today.
80327c And ruin her surprise party?
803007 I wasn't gonna tell her why, silly. But now I can't even find Maud. I'm usually way better at hide-and-seek than this.
80327c Oh, she probably just found a new rock formation and forgot you two were gonna hang out. Tell ya what. You take care of the cake, and I'll look for Maud.
803007 Really? Thanks, Starlight!
803000 [flowerpot clattering]
803007 Just checking.
803000 [door opens]
803007 [whispering] I've gotta get very important ingredients for a very important pony's cake. And it's gotta be tippy-top super-duper secret.
80344f Technically, it's not your turn yet.
803007 Oh. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to cut in front of anypony.
803000 [beat]
803007 Um, whatcha doin'?
80344f I am currently speaking to a pony at a baking supply shop two minutes before it closes for lunch.
803007 Rrrrrright. Okay. Just that I'm trying to plan a party here, and the clock is ticking, while you, uh... What are you doing anyway?
80344f I am currently speaking to a—
803007 I mean, can I help you move this along? What are you looking for? Rolling pins, cupcake tins, cookie cutters with tails and fins?
80344f [to S06E12 Unnamed Unicorn Mare #3] Goodbye.
803007 That's what you've been standing here all this time to say?
80344f I was deciding between "goodbye" and "see you later".
803007 Uh... but, they're the same thing.
80344f Technically, they're very different. "See you later" implies an event in the near future wherein we see each other. "Goodbye" expresses good wishes where parting or at the end of a conversation.
803007 Yyyyyeah, same thing.
80344f I will not apologize for speaking with precision.
803007 In that case, apology not accepted. Goodbye, later, see ya—same thing!
803000 [door slams]
803007 Ugh! Can you believe that guy?! Huh? "Out to Lunch"?! Oh, come on!
803000 [door opens]
803007 [groans] No Maud, no cake, no anything! And how annoying was that pony? Who takes so long to say goodbye? Or was it "see ya later"? Ugh! Now he's got me doing it!
803000 [bump]
803242 [deadpan] Hello, Pinkie Pie.
803007 Maud! Found you! My turn to hide! Hee-hee!
803242 [deadpan] I'm sorry I wasn't around this morning.
803007 Oh, pssh. What are you apologizing to me for? I'm not upset, you silly-willy.
803242 [deadpan] The reason is I met somepony—
803007 Wanna hang out right now? I mean, I can see you're not doing anything with anypony else. Unless they're invisible or reeeeeaaaally small.
803242 [deadpan] Pinkie, the reason I've been so busy is that I have a boyfriend now.
803007 A wha...?
803242 [deadpan] A boyfriend.
803007 A whaaa...?!
803242 [deadpan] A boyfriend.
803007 A whaaaaa...?!
803242 [deadpan] A boyfriend.
803007 That's so exciting! My sister, in love!
803242 [deadpan] Technically, we're in "like".
803007 Tell me everything! Who is he? What's his favorite color? Does he like ice cream? If he were a bird, what kind of bird would he be? Wait. Is he actually a bird? Oh! I don't know, because you haven't told me anything yet!
803242 [deadpan] You'll like him. We have a lot in common.
803007 Well, I love you, so I know I'm gonna love your boyfriend! Oh, I can't wait to meet him!
803242 [deadpan] You don't have to.
803007 [gasps] He's a rock! And you love rocks, so it's perfect! [gasps] Is Boulder jealous?
803242 [deadpan] No. Behind the rock. Mudbriar, are you back there?
80344f Technically, not anymore.
803007 [gasps] A wha-whaaaaaaaaa?!
803242 [deadpan] Pinkie Pie, meet Mudbriar.
80344f Technically, we've already met.
803007 You?!
80344f M'yes.
803007 You?
80344f M'yes.
803007 You...
80344f M'yes.
803007 I mean, [laughs] you! You, you, you!
80344f M'yes. M'yes. M'yes.
803007 I'm sorry. Let's start over. Hi, I'm Maud's sister, Pinkie Pie.
80344f I know.
803007 Sooooo... how did... you two meet?
803242 [deadpan] At a rock show.
803007 Oh! You're into rocks, too?
80344f No. I like sticks.
803007 Then why were you at a rock show?
80344f It was a petrified wood show, which technically makes it a stick show.
803242 [deadpanly happy] Except that in the per-mineralization process of petrification, all organic material is replaced with silicates – i.e., rocks.
80344f While retaining the original structural elements of wood – q.e.d., it was a stick show.
803007 I'm... really into sticks, too! They're great for hitting piñatas! Haaaaa...
803242 [deadpan] Pinkie...
803007 Oh! You wanna go first?
80344f That is stick abuse.
803007 It is? I'm sorry. Oh, this is awful. I'm not being a very good sister. Let's start over. I'm Pinkie Pie! Nice to meet you!
80344f Technically, we've already met.
803242 [deadpan] You should introduce Pinkie to your pet.
803007 Oh! Your pet likes fetch!
80344f This is my pet. So no.
803242 [deadpanly happy] Aw. Look at Twiggy and Boulder playing together.
80344f They're adorable.
803007 [whispering, to Maud] It's just a stick.
803242 [deadpan] Don't be rude.
803007 [sighs] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. One more time. I'm Pinkie Pie! [through gritted teeth] Nice to meet you!
80344f Technically, we've already met.
803007 [growls, snort]
803007 [straining] Daaah! I don't get this guy!
80327c Wow. Maud has a boyfriend?
803007 [groans] How could she like someone so weird? He has an inanimate object for a pet!
80327c So does Maud.
803007 Boulder has ten times the personality of some random stick! Mudbriar, too, for that matter. He's not like Maud at all! Maud is hilarious, friendly, caring, and easy to talk to!
80327c Yep, that's Maud.
803007 But this guy is awkward, quiet, and kind of... strange.
80327c Uh, that also sounds like Maud.
803007 [laughs] You're so funny, Starlight! Maud is nothing like Mudbriar. If she were, then we wouldn't be best sister friends forever.
80327c Well, Maud obviously likes something about him.
803007 [groans]
80327c Maybe you just need to spend more time with him. Find out what you have in common.
803007 That's easy – nothing!
80327c You both care about Maud. I know. He could help you with her party.
803007 I guess...
80327c And I'll keep Maud busy while you and Mudbriar plan the best surprise birthday ever.
803007 That I can do!
803007 Listen. Maud's birthday is tomorrow, and there's no time to waste. You're not afraid of slides, are you?
80344f No. Whyyyyyyyyyyy??!
803000 [crash]
80344f Oof!
803007 No reason. Wheeeeeee!
803000 [crash]
80344f [groans]
803007 Welcome to my party planning cave!
80344f Technically, due to the speleothems growing from the ceiling, this is more of a cavern than a cave. Maud taught me that.
803007 Yeah, okay.
803000 [squeaking]
803007 Here's what I'm thinking for her surprise party – edible rock candy plates, gem-shaped ice cubes, a pebble piñata. Uh... we'll skip that one.
80344f Might I make some suggestions?
803007 Oh. Suggest away! That's why you're here! You and me! Planning... together! Friends!
80344f I have a vision board of everything Maud loves, and none of those things are on it.
803007 Hmph. Let me see this "vision board".
80344f It's not a physical thing. I'm envisioning it. [quietly] Om, I enter through the large door of my mind palace and enter to the back, where I have all of my books and possessions, and what do I encounter? The Maud Room. None of those things are there. [out loud] Just as I thought. Maud doesn't like surprises.
803007 Where does it say that? She never told me that!
80344f Mmm. It sounds like she was protecting your feelings. She's very caring that way.
803007 Stop acting like you know my sister better than me!
80344f Technically, I never said that.
803007 [angrily] Well, technically, I don't care! And since I've been best sister friends forever with Maud my entire life, I think I'm the expert here! Oh, but fine. If you don't believe me, let's ask her! [whispering] But we have to be super-sneaky.
80344f Can you be more specific?
803007 No!
80327c Huh. You must be Mudbriar.
803000 [beat]
80327c I'm Starlight Glimmer. Nice to meet you. I've heard great things!
803000 [beat]
80327c I'm so glad the two of you are spending time together. So... how's it going?
803007 Mudbriar and I have just spent the best time bonding! And we're really starting to make some headway becoming besties, except for one teensy-weensy disagreement that maybe you could settle, Maud. See, Mudbriar here seems to think that [starting to laugh] you don't like surprise parties! Isn't it funny how [suddenly angry] wrong he is?!
803242 [deadpan] I like surprise parties...
803007 Hmmmm.
803242 [deadpan] ...because I know they make you happy when you throw them for me.
803007 See? Wait, what?!
803242 [deadpan] I'd rather just do something small with you, Starlight, Boulder, and Mudbriar for my birthday.
803007 No party? No party?! Did he put you up to this?!
803242 [deadpan] Mm-mm.
803007 [whispering] Maybe you should consider, I don't know, taking things a little less serious with Mudbriar because he's kinda sort of... [loudly] impossible to like?!
80327c Hey, Mudbriar, have you ever flown a kite? Let me tell you all about it. See, the first thing you should do is—
803007 I just can't believe you would choose sitting around with him over a party with your own sister!
803242 [deadpan] I didn't choose either of you. Technically, I said I wanted to be with both of you.
803007 [gasps] "Technically"?! Ugh, you even like the way he talks?
803242 [deadpan] Everything about him makes me happy.
803007 [gasps] [tearing up] Then I guess you don't need a best sister friend forever anymore.
803242 [deadpanly concerned] Pinkie...
80327c Uh, wait, let's all slow down and talk about this.
803007 No! [crying]
80344f See you later!
803007 [crying] I don't understand! How could Maud like Mudbriar? Is it Opposite Day? Nothing makes sense!
803450 I'm not shy, and I hate animals!
803451 Fashion?! Not for me, darling!
803452 Peh! An apple a day is downright disgusting!
803453 Slow and steady wins the race!
803454 I never learned to read!
803455 [laughing]
803007 What if I don't like cupcakes?! [screams]
803000 [rooster crows]
803007 Good morning! Oh, wait. Bad morning. [groans]
803000 [door opens]
8032f5 Get out of bed, sis. If you're gonna be here, you gotta work.
803007 Ohhh.
803000 [pickaxe clinking]
803007 You're probably wondering why I came back to the family farm in the middle of the night.
8032f6 Mm-hmm.
803007 Well, it all started when—
8032f5 Less talking, more farming!
803007 [sad groan] It's just... Maud has a boyfriend.
8032f5 I'm not jealous! Who said anything about jealous?!
803007 Don't be! He's super-duper weird! And somehow, he tricked Maud into liking him. And now I'll never get to see her again! [sighs] I came home because you two know her better than anypony. What am I missing? What does she see in him? [tearing up] What does he have that I don't?! [starts bawling]
8032f5 Buck up, Pinkie Pie. You look as miserable as I feel all the time.
803007 [sniffs]
803000 [splash]
803007 It's just that I love Maud, and I want to love Mudbriar, but I can't see anything to like about him!
803000 [beat]
8032f5 Ugh, fine! We're taking a work break. Come on!
8032f5 I'm looking at a sparkling bright blue and white rock. See it?
803007 You mean that lumpy grey one?
8032f5 No, the beautiful blue and white one. Right there.
803007 I would not describe that as beautiful, blue, or white, but... [laughs nervously] Okay.
8032f5 [to Marble] Show her.
803000 [rock cracks]
803000 [glistening]
8032f5 It's a geode! The outside looks like a regular rock, but the inside is filled with beautiful gems.
803007 So you're saying I should crack open Mudbriar like a rock! It all makes sense! No, wait. It doesn't.
8032f5 It's a metaphor, Pinkie! You see Mudbriar as a rock, but Maud sees him as a gem. Even if you never see past his dullness, you can see how happy he makes Maud. And to a sister, that's all that matters.
8032f6 Mm-hmm!
803000 [rock clinks]
803007 Oh, Limestone, Marble, thank you! I don't know what I'd do without you two! Pie pile!
803000 [thud]
8032f5 Okay, okay! You're crushing me to gravel, Pinkie!
803007 I really owe Mudbriar an apology. [gasps] And I owe Maud a party! I just hope I'm not too late!
803000 [paper rustling]
803000 [whirring hooves]
803007 I brought you an olive branch to say sorry. I was really unfair to you, and I'm ready to listen to your ideas for Maud's birthday, if you still want to plan it together.
80344f Technically, this isn't even an olive branch. It's a quercus, most likely castaneifolia.
803007 Oh, come on! [through gritted teeth] Sorry! Keeping it together...!
80344f And I love a good quercus. Friends?
803007 Friends! Now, do you have any ideas for the party?
80344f There is one.
803000 [music]
803000 [ponies chattering]
803000 [door opens]
8030ec Surprise!
803000 [indistinct talking]
803456 Can you believe this punch? Oh, it's so good!
803457 Another great party!
803458 I know!
803459 Yeah!
803242 [deadpanly happy] This is my favorite party ever.
803007 It was all your amazing boyfriend's idea. He said the best present would be me throwing you a surprise party you didn't have to go to.
80344f Technically, it wasn't a surprise because she could see the pre-party preparations from up here.
803007 [through gritted teeth] Technically... [normally] You're right!
803000 [credits]
804000 [birds chirping]
804000 [ducks quacking]
804040 [growls]
80400e Don't worry, Angel, I won't forget you.
804040 [munching]
80400e [sighs] There's nothing so peaceful as a cuddly friends picnic.
80400d Fluttershy!
804000 [zip!]
80400d [panting]
80400e Oh, goodness, Rarity! What's the matter?
804000 [screech]
80400d Oh, the better question would be, "What isn't the matter?"
80400e Oh, dear. Do you wanna have some lettuce and talk about it?
80400d Uh... Oh! I would love to, darling, but I just don't have the time. The Canterlot Royal Fashion Show is practically upon us, and the cornerstone piece of my collection just isn't working!
80400e Oh, that sounds serious.
80400d Oh-ho-ho, it's serious. The entire collection is designed around it!
80400e Do you need help knitting? I've started making tea cozies. It's an elephant.
804000 [fabric ripping]
80400d Yes, well, I don't need help making clothes. Sassy Saddles is pitching in. Plus, I'll be pulling all three of my Manehattan assistants.
80400e All three? Does that mean you'll have to close Rarity For You?
80400d That's just it, darling. This is Manehattan's busiest shopping season, and I can't just close the shop. So I was hoping... you might consider running it?
80400e Of course. I'm happy to help. Though I'm surprised you picked me.
80400d Well, I may have asked a few others.
80400c Sorry, but we've got a Wonderbolts show coming up.
804000 [zoom!]
804007 Sorry, but it's pie season and the pie orders are piling up.
804003 Sorry, I've got a curriculum to make up.
804008 Nope.
804026 Nnnope.
804000 [record scratches]
804242 [deadpan] My calendar's packed, but I hear Fluttershy's free. And you haven't asked Boulder.
80400d Uh... Oh?
80400d [chuckles] It doesn't matter who else I asked, because I couldn't be happier that you agreed to help!
804000 [theme song]
804000 [door opens]
80400e I think I forgot how big this shop was. How do you find anything?
80400d Oh, darling, it's easy to track. The store is divided into sections – chic, classic, modern, sophisticated, avant-garde, traditional, and obtuse. And, of course, each section is divided by season, color, and price. It's a classic SCP system. Then it's just a little ringing ponies up...
804000 [cash register keys clacking]
804000 [ka-ching!]
80400d ...a little fluff and fold... Voilà! But, of course, that's the easy part.
80400e [gasps] It is?
80400d Mm-hmm. As you well know, the real focus at Rarity For You is on the customer!
804000 [door opens, closes]
80400d Care to give it a try?
80400e Um, okay. [quietly] Hello. Um, welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
80445a I need something classic but modern. Something with drama but also understated.
80400e Um, aren't all those things opposites?
80445a Yes. So?
80400e But how can I—?
80445a I'm sorry. Are you asking me how to do your job?
80400e No! But I just, um—
80400d If I may, I'm thinking noir-esque minimalist but with a twist. Perhaps a tapered hem.
804000 [dramatic music]
80445a [gasps] It's like you read my mind! Are you a fashion psychic? [laughs]
80400d Hmm. The inseams say, "Yes!"
80445b [laugh]
804000 [ka-ching!]
80400e Wow. You make it look so easy.
80400d Oh, darling, come now. You've conquered your shyness a thousand times over. You can't let a few fashion ponies undo all that progress.
80400e I guess not.
80400d You simply must access your inner strength and allow it to shine through!
80400e How?
80400d Uh, daily affirmations? Meditation? Ooh! Power posing works wonders whenever I feel intimidated. Try these. Confident warrior! Gold medalist! Showpony!
804000 [creaking]
804000 [thud]
80400d [clears throat] Or... not.
80433f We need to leave now if we're going to catch the train to Canterlot.
80400d Oh, goodness, look at the time! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, go, go! I'm right behind you!
80400e You're not gonna be here? In your work room?
80400d But, darling, I simply can't. The fashion show is in Canterlot tomorrow, and I'll be up all night, even with the help of all of my assistants!
80400e [gulps]
80400d Well, not all my assistants.
80400e Smoky! Softpad! Smoky Jr.!
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e Oh! [giggles]
80400d Ever since you convinced me to let them live in the shop, these beastie sweeties have been nothing but helpful.
80400e And I'm sure they'll help me let my inner strength shine through!
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400d Oh, I wish I could stay and offer more help. [gasps] Why not try a new outfit? Think of it as the costume for your role as... Shop Pony! Ha ha! You know what they say – "clothes make the pony".
80400e Um, who says that?
80400d You know, "them". All right. I'm sure you and your furry friends will do just fine. Ta-ta!
804000 [door opens, closes]
80400e [sighs] I hope she's right.
804000 [door opens, closes]
80400e Whew. Here goes nothing.
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e Welcome to Rarity For You. What can I help you with?
80445c What's the thread count of this shirt? I can't be seen in anything less than a thousand.
80400e Um, thread... count? Um... Well, I'm not sure. Let's see... Um, one, two, three, four...
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e Um, excuse me for just one second. [pants]
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e Oh, I'm afraid I don't know much about fashion to satisfy these customers. What am I gonna do?
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e Oh, I've never tried to act before, but... I suppose it's worth a shot.
80400e [clears throat, snooty voice] Severe but not unapproachable. Acceptable business attire. [normal voice] Oh, does that sound like a shop pony to you?
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e [snooty voice] So sorry for the wait. The shop has some... staffing issues today.
80445c Yes, well, I still haven't had an answer on this thread count.
80400e Here at Rarity For You, our merchandise defies typical attempts to quantify its quality, but rest assured, it will make you the envy of all who see it.
80445c Oh, in that case, I'll take three!
804000 [ka-ching!]
80400e Ta-ta!
804000 [door opens, closes]
80400e [normal voice, sighs, faints, pants, sighs] Smoky Jr., I can't believe it worked! [snooty voice] I suppose clothes really do make the pony after all.
8042e6 I don't know about you, but I have a full day of shopping planned. And if even one shop pony isn't up to my standards, well, I shall make my displeasure quite plain.
8042d8 Oh, you are wicked! [laughing]
80400d Canterlot fashion show or no, I simply can't leave Fluttershy to fend for herself with these Manehattanites. [panting]
80445c Rarity?
804000 [screech]
80400d Oh, darling, I'm afraid I can't stop. Potential emergency at the boutique.
80445c Oh, well, whatever it is, I'm quite certain the pony you left in charge can handle it. Oh, she's simply divine!
80400d Oh, well, I always knew Fluttershy had it in her. [laughs] And there's still time to catch the train to Canterlot!
80400e [snooty voice] It's an unique play on the old standard. We call it a Rarity cut with a triple-cut stitched hem and a guacamole chevka pattern fabric.
80445d Don't you mean "chevron"?
80400e If I had meant "chevron", then that's what I would've said.
80445d [chuckles] Of course. It's so unique! So en vogue! It must be mine!
804000 [ka-ching!]
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e [normal voice] Aw, thanks, everyone. But I feel I should push the snootiness further.
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e If you really wanna help, I suppose serving tea would be nice. Oh, if you don't mind.
804000 [tea pouring]
80445e I like my accessories bold and shiny, and I'm just not seeing anything nearly bold and shiny enough.
80400e [snooty voice] I'm afraid bold and shiny won't work with your whole... modelle. Perhaps... pointy.
80445e Pointy? Yes! I must have pointy!
80400e Not everypony can pull off a found object, but you... nearly get there.
804000 [ka-ching!]
80445f [millennial accent] I need, like, a red carpet glitz-and-glamour gown that's also casual, but, like, still artsy and a total head-turner.
80400e Yes. Casual chic prêt-à-porter is very branché this season.
80445f Uhhh... Like, I don't understand any of that, so, like... I don't care about it?
80400e Um, one moment, please.
804000 [zip!]
804000 [raccoons chitter]
80400e [normal voice] Oh, I think I need a new character.
80400e [hipster voice] Okay, I've got, like, this high-key savage look for you? It's a totally live ensemble with a little, like, thingies that sparkle and make the whole squad go, "Whoa! That pony is 'woke'!"
80445f That is, like, exactly what I need!
804000 [raccoons chitter]
804460 This store is a desperate wasteland of nothingness. Do you have anything in black?
80400e [hipster voice] Can you, like, chill for one sec? BRB.
804000 [zip!]
80400e [goth voice] It's not like the futility of shopping can be made better with black leather and metal studs, but they help.
804460 Uh.... that jacket completes me.
804461 [spits] [British accent] This tea's, like, lukewarm. It's barely drinkable.
80400e [snooty voice] This tea must always be at a precise temperature! See that it doesn't happen again!
804000 [raccoon chitter sadly]
80400e [hipster voice] Whoa, that color is, like, almost too lit for you? [goth voice] The blackness of this vest is a reflection of your soul. [snooty voice] This hemline is nothing short of an inspiration of craftsponyship. Are you sure you deserve it?
804000 [music]
804000 [hoof pounding]
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804000 [slow motion sounds]
804000 [splash]
80400e [gasps]
804462 [screaming]
80400e [snooty voice] I don't know what's worse – that you spilled the tea or that it's still cold! Either get it right or go back to the forest!
804000 [racoons chittering angrily]
804000 [dishes clatter]
80400e Oh, it is so hard to find good help these days.
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804005 Okay! Okay! Slow down, everyone! I'm doing my best!
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804005 So, Rarity is busy at an important fashion show, and Fluttershy is running her shop in Manehattan, but to do it, she's playing different shop pony characters that are all mean?
804000 [raccoons chittering happily]
804003 How in the world did you figure that out, Spike?
804005 I'm not Dragon Charades champion for nothin'!
804003 I can't imagine Fluttershy would ever be mean to her animal friends. This sounds serious. Spike, tell everyone it's time to head back to Saddle Row!
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e [snooty voice] I wouldn't think it was possible to make something so dowdy even more matronly, but here you are. [goth voice] It's like a scream in the void, empty and ultimately meaningless. [hipster voice] I would srsly help you right now, but, like, I don't wanna, you know?
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804003 You weren't kidding. This is worse than we thought! She's being horrible to everypony!
804008 Uh, are you sure that's even Fluttershy?
804007 Maybe it's just three really, really fast ponies that really, really look like her!
80400c Well, let's find out! Hey, Fluttershy? Are you running the shop or performing in a one-pony show?
80400e [snooty voice] If you don't mind, I can only improve the taste of one customer at a time. You'll have to wait your turn. Ugh, honestly! These small town ponies come to the big city and think they can behave any way they please!
80400c What?! You are a small-town pony! And your cottage isn't even in the town!
804008 Look, Fluttershy, we came here because we were worried and we care about you.
80400e [goth voice, to Neigh Sayer] Let's get out of this aura of positivity before it consumes us.
804007 As fun as this Fluttershy switcheroo game is, Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad are really concerned.
804005 Yeah! They came all the way to Ponyville to get us.
804000 [raccoons chittering]
80400e [hipster voice] They should have, like, stayed there? The shop is, like, a no-rodent zone now.
804463 [gasps]
804000 [raccoons gasping]
804007 She called them "rodents"?!
804003 Fluttershy, I understand why you think you have to act this way for these customers, but there's gotta be a better way.
80400e [snooty voice] [sarcastically] Goodness! You are so right. Please, step this way so that we may discuss your concerns.
804003 I knew you'd come to your senses!
804000 [door slams]
80400e [snooty voice] Indeed.
804000 [crowd muttering]
80400d Ugh, the centerpiece of my collection, and it's still not right! Oh, darling, I'm afraid we've literally run out of time. It's up to you! Go out there and sell it! Now, attitude!
804000 [ponies cheering, cameras clicking]
80400d I don't understand. When I left Fluttershy, she had everything well in hoof.
804003 Well, things might have seemed all right when you left, but they're definitely not all right now.
804008 She's actin' worse than the worst Manehattanite I ever saw!
80400c She kicked us out of the shop!
804007 She called Smoky, Smoky Jr., and Softpad... "rodents"!
80400d Wh-wh-wha... Rodents?! Well, why didn't you say that from the start?! She obviously needs help! Come on!
80400e [goth voice] Your melancholy is way too shallow for a look with this much unfeeling depth.
804460 Huh.
80400e [hipster voice] Ugh! Your style isn't even on the same page? Turn away. Don't even look at it, okay?
80445f [gasps] I can't even!
804000 [magic noises]
804000 [hooks sliding]
80400e [snooty voice] I think not, dear! This is all far too fashion forward for the likes of you!
80445c Ugh! Well, I never!
804000 [door opens]
804000 [door slams]
804008 [sighs] Told ya it was bad.
80400d Bad? This is worse than I could've possibly imagined!
80400e [snooty voice] Rarity! I'm so glad you're here! [kissing noises] Finally, a pony who understands that the couture in this shop is far too brilliant to even consider selling!
80400d Whaaat?!
80400e [hipster voice] You, like, totally get how lame customers are? Ugh! [goth voice] Watching them leave filled me with a sweet sadness. [snooty voice] And you'll be pleased to hear that I've taken care of your rodent situation.
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804007 Will somebody tell her to stop saying that?!
80400d That's it! Fluttershy, I'm afraid you've left me no choice! You are terminated!
80400e [snooty voice] Well! Good luck replacing me! Humph!
80400d [sighs] Well, thankfully I— [shrieks]
80400e [goth voice] I always thought she was too controlling.
80400d You— you— you are terminated, too!
80400e [goth voice] Whatever.
80400d Now, I— [shrieks]
80400e [hipster voice] I know, right? I mean, uh, ugh?
80400d Actually, you're, like, totally terminated as well!
80400e [hipster voice] Like, okay.
80400d [sighs] Well, I'm glad that's over— [shrieks]
80400e [normal voice] I guess I owe everypony an apology.
80400d [sighs] You think?
80400e I got so caught up trying to please all of your customers that—
80400c What customers?
80400e I might have taken my salespony characters a little too far.
804000 [pumping]
80400e [to raccoons] I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. You know I was only pretending, right?
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804003 But, Fluttershy, why did you think you needed to be somepony else to run the shop?
80400e I guess acting like the ponies of Saddle Row gave me the confidence to interact with them.
80400d Darling, I'd never trust some horrible Saddle Row pony to run my shop. That's why I wanted a friend to do it.
80400e Well, I'd definitely rather be myself anyway, even if I don't exactly have what it takes to be a shop pony.
804003 I wouldn't sell yourself short. Those salespony characters all came from you!
80400c Yeah! I think you totally have what it takes.
804007 Maybe a little too much.
80400d Indeed. You have all the inner strength you need, but I think we prefer it coming from our sweet, regular Fluttershy.
804464 [laughing]
80400d And that's just given me the inspiration I'm looking for!
80400d And last one... There! The missing piece for my new collection – the Warrior of Inner Strength!
804000 [Mane Six and ponies cheering and applauding]
804000 [raccoons chittering]
804034 Oh, gorgeous!
80400e Oh, it's lovely, Rarity! I'm just sorry you had to leave the Canterlot Royal Fashion Show early.
80400d Oh, darling, making the perfect dress is scads more satisfying than showing it off.
804000 [customers chattering]
8042e4 Ooh, striking dress, Rarity. I certainly hope you aren't trying to undercut the Royal Fashion Show by ducking out and debuting it here.
80400d What? No, I—
80400e [snooty voice] Have you considered the possibility that the Royal Fashion Show is trying to undercut Rarity's by continuing on in Canterlot and not moving the whole affair here?! Hmm?! Have you?! Hmmm?!
8042e4 I, uh... No.
80400e [snooty voice] Hmph! Just as I thought! Hmmm!
804000 [beat]
80400e [to Rarity] Oh! [giggles] Inner strength.
80407e [laughing]
804000 [credits]
80507b I'm sooo glad I made it to Las Pegasus before the fastest, most thrilling ride of all time closes for good!
80500c Wait. The fastest, most thrilling ride of all time?
80507a [gasps] She hasn't heard of the Wild Blue Yonder?
80500c [scoffs] Of course I have! It's that one where, uh... All right, you got me. What is it?
80507b Only the coolest rollercoaster ever!
80507a [scoffs] You can't really call yourself a Wonderbolt if you haven't been on it.
80500c It looks incredible!
80507b Oh, it is. First, you strap yourself into the cloud rocket car, and then you're catapulted straight through a...
80500c ...series of daring dips and terrifying turns...
80500c ...flipping upside-down so many times you don't know which way is up!
80500c 'Til finally you climb to the highest peak on the rails! Then drop towards the ground at lightning speed...
80500c ...before coming up to a screeching halt! It's the coolest ride ever to exist in the history of Equestria!
805008 So, when did you ride it?
80500c Oh. [laughs] I haven't.
805008 [sighs]
805000 [theme song]
805008 [grunts]
80500c The ride closes this week! Forever! But I can't go to Las Pegasus because I have to teach at Twilight's school. I'm gonna miss out on the coolest rollercoaster of all time! Unless...
805008 Why do I feel like you're about to ask me a mighty big favor?
80500c Can you cover my classes? [whimper]
805008 Absolutely!
80500c Really? Awesome! [whoosh, grunts]
805008 On one condition. You tag along with a few other ponies goin' to Las Pegasus.
80500c [laughs] Surely you don't mean Granny Smith!
805008 No, no, of course not. I mean Granny Smith and the rest of the Gold Horseshoe Gals.
805009 Hurry your haunches, hinnies!
805008 Grand Auntie Applesauce, cousin Apple Rose, and cousin Goldie Delicious.
805000 [cat meows]
805008 Why, I'm sure they'd be plumb tickled to have you join their annual grandmares' trip to Las Pegasus. It'll be perfect. I'll teach your classes, and you can look after them for me.
80500c [scoffs] Look after them?
805008 So they don't get too carried away. Usually Big Mac goes along as a chaperone, but I'm sure he'd love a break.
805000 [drag, snap, meow]
80500c There is no way I'm going to Las Pegasus with a bunch of old, slow grannies!
805008 So you don't mind missin' your only chance to ride the Wild Blue Yonder?
80500c Ugh, fine! I'll go!
805008 Ha! That's the spirit! Now skedaddle so I can help them get ready.
805009 Applejack! Have you seen my cranky flank cream? I can't find it in this whole tootin' farmhouse.
805008 It's, uh, gonna take a while.
805000 [clock chimes]
80500c [groaning] Why is this taking so long? The Wild Blue Yonder's gonna close before we even get to Las Pegasus.
805008 Here. I made a list to help you keep the grandmares out of trouble. Don't wanna have to bring 'em back home before you get to go on your rollercoaster.
80500c That could happen?!
805008 Only if you don't follow the rules. These grannies need a lot of care. If one of 'em overdoes it, it's bye-bye Las Pegasus for the lot of ya.
80500c [reading] "Make sure they get their naps". "Eat only soft foods". "Careful when dancing"? "Don't get too excited"? Seriously?!
805008 And don't let 'em out of your sight. Ever.
80500c Wait. Then how am I supposed to go on the rollercoaster?
805008 You'll find time. And you might even learn a thing or two about havin' a good time from these old gals.
80500c Yeah. That'll happen.
805008 All right, y'all! Time to get this show on the road! [chuckles] Or in the sky, in this case.
805000 [grannies chattering]
80500c [groans] Come on, come on, come on!
805000 [cats meowing]
80500c [groans]
805000 [whooshing]
80500c Go, go, go, go, go!
80500c Argh! Everypony okay in there?
805009 Dandy as a pansy in a plant pot!
8051e6 You know, this hot air balloon ride reminds me of the time I climbed a tree. Have I ever told you that story?
8051e5 Only about a million times.
8051e6 Huh? What did you say?
80500c [echoing] They said they've heard the tree story!
8051e6 Oh, you wanna hear the tree story? Okay.
805214 Here we go again.
8051e6 Back when I was a young filly, I was afraid of tree-climbin'. These knockin' hooves sweatin'. Have you ever had the hoof sweats? Well, they're just the worst thing. You know, cousin Strudel – she used to get 'em too. Now, of course she was a champion fritter... [fades out]
805000 [distant cheers]
80500c The Wild Blue Yonder is in our hotel?! Uh, I bet you grannies are feeling super tired from your journey.
805009 Nope! How about a trot down the avenue to see the sights, girls?
805214 Oh, forget the sights! I came here to play some serious horseshoe toss!
8051e6 Oh, can we see the rainbow fountains at the water show? They're so magical!
8051e5 My pores are crying for a mud mask at the Prism Palace Spa!
80500c You know what would be really fun? Relaxing in our room! Come on. Last one to the hotel is a rotten apple! [whoosh] Let me get that for ya. [grunting]
805000 [distant cheering]
80500c [gasps] Oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh-oh-my-gosh! There it is! The best rollercoaster ever!
805214 Aaah! Warm up those withers, ladies! There's a horseshoe-hurlin' trophy with our names on it!
805465 [groaning]
805466 [ghostly voice] Don't let them get too excited! Or you'll have to go hooooooome!
80500c [gasps] Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa. That sounds a little too exciting. Why don't we get you checked in first?
8051e5 Oh, my. You are a strong pony. Aren't you, sugarhocks?
805207 [gulps]
805465 [giggling]
80500c [groans]
805000 [door opens]
805207 Welcome to our Gold Horseshoe Suite. Only the best of the best for our favorite guests. Which, of course, means you lovely mares.
8051e5 Why, thank you a bushel and a peck, you scrumptious morsel of frosted carrot cake.
805207 Oh. [chuckles] Thank you, ma'am.
8051e5 I think he was sweet on me. Maybe I should ask him to accompany me to the magic show tonight.
805009 Ha-ha! You sure your name's not Applesaucey? Better find the brakes on that buggy, sugar. We just got here.
8051e5 You're right. Better see what else is out there first. The day is young, and I am not!
805465 [giggling]
80500c Uh, Granny Smith's right. Let's not overdo it. How about a nice nap so you can really enjoy Las Pegasus?
805214 [yawns] Good idea. We could use some shut-eye, hmm?
8051e6 But I'm not tired. Uh, oh, right! Uh, yaaaawn.
805465 [yawning]
805009 You go along now and explore while we rest, sugar booger. Yawn.
80500c Uh, if you say so! [to Lemon Squeezy] What? They'll be in here sleeping the whole time I'm gone!
805000 [beat]
80500c Quit judging me!
805000 [door closes]
80500c [clears throat] One ticket for the coolest rollercoaster of all time, please. [gasps] But... But... this line never ends!
805467 I know, right? Good thing we can just stand here all day without any responsibilities waiting for us!
80500c [groan]
805467 Oh, hey, thanks!
80500c Enjoy the ride.
805000 [door opens, closes]
80500c Heh. They didn't even know I left.
805000 [cat meows]
80500c Whoa!
805000 [cat meows]
80500c Aah! [gasps] They're gone!
80500c [panicked whimpering] Granny Smith! Apple Rose! Are you here?! Applesauce? Goldie? Oh, I'm the worst chaperone ever!
805466 [ghostly voice] Don't let them out of your siiiiiiiiight!
80500c I know, I know! Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a group of old mares around here?
805468 Lady, you just described half the ponies in this place.
80500c [groans] This place is huge! They could be anywhere!
8050ec [chanting] Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie! Goldie!
805469 Can they do it? Can good old Goldie Delicious and the Gold Horseshoe Gals break the all-time resort record, folks?
805000 [clang]
8050ec [cheers]
805214 Now that's how you hurl a horseshoe!
80500c Ha! No way! Goldie's totally got game!
805469 Make some noise for the best-played game of horseshoes this resort has ever seen! Can you believe your eyes, folks?
805000 [crowd cheering]
80500c Yeah! Go, Goldie!
805469 Stand back! She's getting excited!
80500c Huh? Uh-oh!
805214 Oh, oop!
80500c Uh, mind if I try?
805000 [clank]
80500c Whoops. Guess I'm no good at this game. Sorry.
805469 And the Gold Horseshoe Gals are out! Looks like the show's over, everypony.
8050ec Awww! [groaning]
80500c Oh, I'm so glad I found you! Everypony feeling okay? Not too excited?
805214 Pretty much the opposite right now.
80500c [sighs] Good. From now on, I'm not letting you grannies out of my sight.
8051e5 In that case, let's paint the town candy apple red!
805214 Ooh! We could play more games!
8051e6 Or go shopping for hats! Have I ever told you about the time I got a new hat, and it turned out to be a bird? [laughs]
805009 That's what we ought to do!
80500c Really?
805009 Hit the buffet! All that horseshoe tossin' sure works up an appy-tite.
80500c [sighs] Uh-huh...
805009 I love me some nachos. I'mma set my dentures loose on these vittles until the crumbs cry uncle!
805466 [ghostly voice] They can only eat soft foods! You're a nacho away from no rolly-coaster!
805000 [whoosh, clang]
805009 [exclamation of surprise]
80500c Come on, Granny. You know you can't have those. They're super crunchy.
805000 [clang]
805000 [whoosh]
80500c How about some nice soft carrot soup, instead?
805009 I thought you was supposed to be the fun one.
80500c Wait. I am fun!
805469 [over P.A.] Attention all, thrill-seekers! There's only one day left to ride the ride of all rides, the Wild Blue Yonder, before it's gone for good! Get in line! Now!
80500c [anxious groan] So... what does everypony want to do tonight? I was thinking go to our room and put on eye masks and earplugs? [crunching]
8051e5 I'd rather hit the club and show off my dance moves. I'm quite a legend when it comes to rumba.
805465 [agreement]
80500c Sounds kind of intense. Aren't you all exhausted from your big day?
805214 Heck no! We save up our energy all year for Las Pegasus weekend, isn't that right, girls?
8051eb Mmm-hmm!
80500c Ugh. Dancing it is, then. I'll be there.
805000 [splat]
805000 [trance-like music]
805466 [ghostly voice] Careful when daaaaaanciiiiing!
80500c Ugh! Stop doing that! Uh, that's probably enough dancing for now! Right, Apple Rose?
8051e6 Oh, that was just my warm-up.
8051e5 Look! It's our favorite magicians, Big Bucks and Jack Pot! And aren't they lookin' handsome as ever?
80546a [laughs, ahem] You little fillies have got some smooth moves!
805465 [giggling]
80546b Say, how would you Gold Horseshoe Gals like to bring some of that good energy into our magic show tonight?
80546a Here's five complimentary VIP tickets to our most amazing trick in the Pone Fantastique Theater, just over there.
8051e5 Sugarcube, we never miss your show.
80546a Fabulous. We'll save a spot for you on stage.
80546b And in our hearts.
80500c So gross.
805465 [cheering]
805009 Yeehaw, girls! Applesauce landed us some Very Important Pony tickets for the show tonight! [chuckles]
805465 [laughing and giggling]
80500c Oh, come on! You said you were going back to the room after dancing! So each pony could have some alone time?
805214 Oh, now don't be a stick in the mud! Trust me, you'll loooove this show! It's the best thing in Las Pegasus!
805000 [grannies cheering]
805467 Oh, hey! Thanks for giving me your place in line. They said I'm one of the last ponies ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! Ha!
805000 [applause]
80546b And now, for the trick that made us famous!
80546a The most dangerous magical feat known to ponykind.
805000 [music]
80546a We'd like to invite some very special mares to the stage.
8051e5 That's our cue, girls!
80500c Hey, where are you going? Come back!
80546b Meet our lovely assistants!
805000 [applause]
80546a They will make a splashtastic escape using only the instructions we give them... with our minds.
8050ec [oohs]
80546b Don't try this at home, folks!
805000 [hatch opens, water flowing]
80500c [gasps]
805466 [normal voice] Do I really have to say anything?
80500c Release those grannies, right now!
8050ec [shocked gasps]
80500c [grunting]
805000 [creaking]
805000 [splash!]
8050ec [gasps]
805009 What'd ya go and do that for?! That was our big star moment!
80500c Y-You were in danger! I saw the water! You were trapped!
805214 Oh, pish-tosh! This is a magic show! We've seen it a thousand times! Everypony always escapes.
805000 [crowd murmuring]
80546b Uh, that's right, folks! Because of our, um, skill as magicians!
80546a And now, a disappearing act!
805000 [poof!]
8051e5 Well, I hope you're happy! We've been waiting to be picked as the lovely assistants in that trick for years!
805214 You keep ruinin' our fun! I had a hot hoof goin' in that game you decided to lose for us!
805009 And I wanted to eat those nachos at the buffet!
8051e6 And I could have torn up the dance floor if you didn't keep stopping me!
805009 They're bein' too polite to say it, so I will! Rainbow Dash, we thought you'd be a hoot, but I ain't never met a wetter hen!
80500c What?!
805214 She's right! You've had your mane in a twist ever since we arrived!
8051e6 Is something the matter, dear?
80500c I'm so sorry, everypony. The truth is, all I wanted to do for this whole trip is ride the Wild Blue Yonder. I mean, it's why I came to Las Pegasus in the first place! Applejack told me not to let you out of my sight, or you might overdo it and we'd have to go home early.
8051e5 Applejack put you up to this?
805465 [annoyed chattering]
80500c Well, now it's too late. I ruined your trip, and it's the last day ever to ride the Wild Blue Yonder! The line is so long, I'll never get to go on it.
805465 [laughing]
80500c Hey, what's so funny?
805009 [chuckling] Is that all you wanted?
805214 Well, fish-flavored kitten kibble. Why didn't you say so sooner? Come on, girls!
805000 [trumpet fanfare]
805009 We're Gold Horseshoe members. The most exclusive club in Las Pegasus. And she's with us.
805214 We've been comin' here every moon since we can remember. Even some we don't remember.
8051e5 It definitely has its perks.
80500c Like fancy suites and rollercoaster rides?
8051e6 That's right. And I hope you like riding in the front.
80500c Um, yes! [squeals] This is amazing! Isn't this amazing?
805009 Sugar, you probably want to hold on 'bout now.
805000 [coaster clanking]
805000 [cheering]
805000 [snap! snap! snap!]
80500c I'm sorry I misjudged you for being older ponies. You mares are actually pretty cool.
805009 Rainbow Dash?
80500c Yeah, Granny?
805009 The gals and I have been talkin', and, well... We think you're a hoot after all! We'd like to invite you to become a permanent member of the Gold Horseshoe Gals! [hoots]
80500c Ha-ha! Really?
805465 Mm-hmm.
8051e5 Same time next year?
80500c I wouldn't miss it for anything!
805000 [credits]
806000 [doors open]
806065 Princess Twilight!
806080 We're glowing!
806003 [giggling] That's what happens when you're summoned by the Map.
806066 Somepony needs our help?
80600a We're being called by the Map?
806065 Did I mention we're glowing?!
806003 [giggling]
806065 So where exactly in Equestria are we needed?
806003 Actually, where you're going isn't even in Equestria.
806066 Wow! That's almost... off the table!
80600a But what's way out there?
806003 Mount Aris, the home of the Hippogriffs! And that's where you're headed!
806080 Whoa...!
806000 [theme song]
806000 [ponies chattering]
806066 You really don't need to come with us, Twilight. We can take care of this mission just fine on our own.
80600a Mm-hmm.
806065 Yeah!
806000 [thud]
806065 Oof!
806066 Ugh!
806003 I know that. But I'm not so sure the ponies who care about you want you going off so far on your own. Besides, there's some school business I need to take care of on Mount Aris. This permission slip is for Silverstream. It's very important that her mother and father sign it, or else no field trips.
806065 [whispering, to Apple Bloom and Sweetie Belle] Sounds like somepony just wants a vacation.
806080 [giggling]
806003 Okay, yes, I have been wanting to visit Mount Aris ever since the Hippogriffs moved back. But it's purely research. Silverstream's brother is gonna meet us there and take us to their houses.
80600a Wow! They have more than one house?
806003 I guess so. The social structure of the Hippogriffs and seaponies is a bit of a mystery.
806439 All aboard! Last stop – the new Mount Aris Station!
806000 [ponies chattering]
806000 [train whistle blows]
806000 [train chugging]
806066 I don't know if I'd like being a Hippogriff. Part bird, part pony...
806065 I'm happy with just my pony parts, thanks.
80600a I think Hippogriffs are pretty neat. I learned all about them from Applejack. The Hippogriffs all once lived happily on Mount Aris. But when the Storm King invaded, they used a magic pearl to turn into seaponies and escape to the underwater safety of Seaquestria. Then, in the Battle of Canterlot, when Applejack defeated the Storm King—
806003 Wait, what? She told you she defeated him? By herself?
80600a Uh, maybe she didn't say that exactly. But it makes for a better story.
806003 [giggling]
806000 [train whistle blows]
806439 Final stop – Mount Aris Station!
806065 [gasps]
806080 Whoa!
806000 [train chugging]
806000 [brakes hissing]
806066 All right. So what kind of cutie mark-related friendship problem do you think we're supposed to solve.
806003 I don't know. But Hippogriffs don't have cutie marks. So it might not have anything to do with that at all.
80600a Huh. Still, the Map called us, so it must be a kind of problem that only we can solve.
806080 Go, Crusaders!
806066 But how do we know exactly who we're supposed to help?
806065 Ahem. Attention, please! Anygriff here have a problem?
806000 [beat]
806065 Eh. That's all I got.
80600a Maybe if the Map could be a little more specific about our mission, like maybe... an address?
806003 The Map doesn't really work like that. But I'm sure you and whoever needs help will find each other.
806000 [water splashing]
80646c Excuse me! Miss Sparkle? Over here! Sorry I'm late. I'm Silverstream's brother Terramar.
80600a A Hippogriff can have a seapony for a brother? How does that work exactly?
806066 Shhh! It's rude to ask a question like that!
806000 [magic sounds]
806065 Whoa!
80600a Can I ask now?
80646c [chuckles] It is kind of strange. See, after the Storm King was defeated, the seaponies didn't have to hide anymore. So some of them changed back to Hippogriffs and went home to Mount Aris.
806003 But others got used to living under the water and stayed in Seaquestria.
80646c And me? Well, I kind of go back and forth with this. It's a tiny piece of the magic pearl. It was split up among our kingdoms.
80600a Whoa!
806105 Cool!
806003 Well, I'm pretty eager to see the Hippogriff village. You know, to... get this form signed. And... research! So...
80600a Hey, Terramar? Does anygriff you know up there have a problem they need help with?
80646c [chuckles] On Mount Aris? No. Everygriff is pretty happy up there. [sighs] It's a great place to live.
806000 [Hippogriffs laughing]
806003 Whoa! This looks amazing! Last time I was here, it was a ghost town!
80646c Yeah. Queen Novo thought it was important to return our village to its former glory.
806000 [trumpet fanfare]
80646d And now, I officially open the "Glad to Be a Hippogriff" Festival!
806000 [trumpet fanfare]
806000 [Hippogriffs cheering]
806000 [whoosh!]
806000 [Hippogriffs cheering]
80646e Ahh! Whoa!
806000 [Hippogriffs continue cheering]
806065 Wow! We picked a good day to show up!
80646c Not really. We do this every weekend. Hippogriffs really like being Hippogriffs.
806000 [Hippogriffs cheering]
80646d [chuckles] There's my boy!
80646c Hi, Dad!
80646d Haven't seen you in days, son. Wish you'd come around more often.
80646c Oh! Dad, these are some of Silverstream's friends from Equestria. They came up to—
80646d [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! [screeches]
806080 Aah!
80646d Attention, everygriff! Princess Twilight Sparkle is here! She's Silverstream's teacher!
806000 [Hippogriffs gasping and exclaiming]
80646d Here to take in the marvel that is Mount Aris, your Highness?
806003 Absolutely! And to have you sign a form for Silverstream.
80646d Glad to! But first, let's show the princess some real Mount Aris hospitality! To the refreshment tent for a stein of salmon juice!
806003 Eh. Research. See you later! And good luck! I know you'll find your mission!
806066 Well, your dad's certainly... outgoing, isn't he?
80646c He's a great guy. All my relatives are nice. That's kind of the problem—
806066 Wait, stop.
806000 [whimsical wind chimes]
806066 What's that wonderful sound?
80646c Those are the Harmonizing Heights. Legend says that—
806000 [zoom!]
806000 [whimsical wind chimes]
806000 [birds chirping]
806000 [water splashing]
806066 Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! I love this!
80646c Uh, is she okay?
806066 This is absolutely the best place ever! You are so lucky!
806065 And you get to swim in the ocean! You have two great places to live!
80600a How do you make up your mind which one to stay in?
80646c I can't. That's the problem.
80600a Did you say... "problem"?
806066 You have a problem?!
806065 Yes!
806066 Woo-hoo! We discovered our mission!
806065 All right!
80600a We did it! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! [chuckles nervously]
806065 Sorry. You were talking about your problem?
80646c Right. Like I said, Mount Aris is one great place to live. That's why Silverstream and my dad and some of my cousins came back here. But Seaquestria is another great place to live. That's where my mom is.
806066 Ohhhh. I-I didn't know that.
80646c So no matter where I am, I feel like I'm letting someone down.
80600a No wonder you're having such a hard time deciding.
80646c And I have to choose soon. Every other griff my age already knows where they belong. I'm still not sure.
806065 When in doubt, chart it out!
806065 Now, we put down everything great about each place and everything not so great. Compare them, and... your decision is made for you!
806066 Well, it's obvious, isn't it? Mount Aris is the best of all possible worlds. Pro – it's beautiful. Con – too far from Equestria. I think that pretty much sums it up.
80646c But you haven't been to Seaquestria yet. How can you even compare them?
80600a Terramar's right, Sweetie Belle. It'd be fair if we visited both places before we decide.
806000 [screech]
806003 Hey, everypony! This festival is fantastic! Look what I won at the ring toss booth! Ahem. But of course, I'm really here on business. Sky Beak's already signed the form. Now I just need your mom's signature. Is she around?
80600a Um... she's a seapony. In Seaquestria.
806003 That's what Silverstream meant by "houses"!
80646c Mm-hmm. If you'd like to meet my mom, we're just heading down there now.
80600a And how exactly are we gonna visit underwater?
806000 [magic sounds]
806000 [water bubbling]
806065 Whoa! [giggling] Woo-hoo! Yeah! [giggling] Whoa! This must be just like flying! Woo-hoo!
80600a Where's your mom's house, Terramar?
80646c Come on. It's this way.
806065 This is awesome!
806065 [giggling]
80646c Mom!
80646f Terramar! Welcome home, baby! No excuses. This time, you're staying for dinner.
80646c [chuckles] Scootaloo, Sweetie Belle, Apple Bloom, this is my mom Ocean Flow. And this is—
80646f [gasps] Princess Twilight Sparkle! What an honor! You know, Silverstream just raves about you.
806003 Well, she is one of our most hardworking students. In fact, I brought this form for you to sign so that—
80646f Both my children are so smart. Would you like to see their baby pictures?
80646c Mom!
806003 That sounds adorable! I'd love to! And you know, to find out about aquatic pony early development and, uh...
806080 [giggling] Research.
80646f Oh, well, maybe your friends would like a snack while we're gone? Some kelp chips? Fish oil tea?
80646c No, thanks, Mom. I'm gonna go show them around.
806065 Look out! [giggling] Can't catch me!
806066 Huh. Not much sunlight down here, is there?
806065 [giggling]
806000 [bongo drums drumming]
806065 Boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom-ba-da-boom!
806066 No grass to run in and no hooves to run on it with. And excuse me, but how do you keep from getting all pruney? [sighs]
806065 [laughing]
806000 [thud]
806065 [bubbly] Everything sounds funny down here!
806066 Okay. I've seen everything I need to. So, uh, why don't we find Twilight Sparkle, finish the chart, and, uh, head back up the mountain? I have some serious field twirling to do.
806065 Where's she going? I want to stay and swim some more! [sighs]
806000 [magic sounds]
806000 [seagull squawking]
80646d [screeches] Princess Twilight, you're back! And just in time for the screeching competition.
806003 Why not? Could be another trophy in my future! Be back soon!
806065 All right! Let's add some positives to the Seaquestria side!
80600a Uh-huh!
806065 Swimming is like flying, multi-color fish, and did I mention the flying thing?!
806066 You forgot the cons. Dark, wet, sea monsters...
806065 I don't remember any sea monsters. Apple Bloom, looks like it's up to you.
80600a Me? Well... Both places have a lot of good things about them. I can understand why it's hard for you to decide.
80600a [Apple Bloom]
80600a Your heart is in two places, you can only live in one
80600a You're torn between the hilltops and the tide
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Thank goodness that the Cutie Mark Crusaders have begun
806066 To give you hope and help you to decide
806066 These hills, they call to you, they say "Harmonizing Heights"
806066 This is your home, simple and serene
806066 The sun-dappled leaves or a mountain terrace
806066 You can see twenty-three different shades of green
806066 To dare to compare anywhere to there
806066 Is unfair and just plain wrong
806066 Colt or mare or you wear feathers, fins, or hair
806066 This is where you belong
806065 Well, on the other hoof, I can think of a place that's way more exciting and cool, not to mention more you! Come on, you know exactly where I mean!
806065 Seaquestria's the most, you're supposed to be there
806065 Underneath the sea where you can feel at home
806065 Swimmin' with your friends, you can spend all day here
806065 Playin' in the bay here, splashin' in the foam
806065 Sailin' through the wavy blue
806065 You'll view a slew of tortoises
806065 Forget the rest, the sea's the best
806065 For all intents and "porpoises"
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Build your nest here on Harmonizing Heights
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 Live it up here in Seaquestria
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Nothing compares to Harmonizing Heights
806066 The eagles are regal
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 But the schools are cooler
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Their claws are so awesome
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 With their sweet maneuvers
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Star wishes every night
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 Starfish by eel light
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Better
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 Wetter
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Shinier
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 Brinier
806065 Seaquestria!
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Harmonizing Heights!
806065 [Scootaloo]
806065 Seaquestria!
806066 [Sweetie Belle]
806066 Harmonizing Heights!
806000 [Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo]
806000 That's it! This is the end!
806000 Don't ever talk to me again!
80600a Terramar, where're you goin'?
80646c Ugh! If you all can't even agree amongst yourselves, how am I supposed to make up my mind?! It's hopeless!
806065 Hmph!
80600a Sweetie Belle said to tell you it's your fault that Terramar ran off.
806065 Well, you tell Sweetie Belle that if it weren't for her, our mission would've been over by now! And a success!
80600a [sighs] Scootaloo says this whole thing is your fault.
806066 Well, tell her that I'm not the one who dashed all of Terramar's hopes and made him give up on the world! Both worlds!
80600a [sighs] Sweetie Belle says it's your fault that Terramar ran— Oh. Wait. I already told you that, didn't I?
806003 Uh, what's going on? Where's Terramar?
80600a Uh, well... he... he kinda left. He wanted to be by himself.
806065 Which was not my fault!
806066 Mine, either!
806003 Well, of course not. Why would you think that?
806105 Because it was our fault.
806065 All we had to do was help him choose which world to live in.
806066 And we let him down.
806003 Whoever said that he had to choose?
80600a Well, he did.
806003 Hmmm... Maybe Terramar's making it harder than it has to be.
80646f Yoo-hoo! Princess! We're having a seashell-crafting circle. Care to join us?
806003 Actually, we're right in the middle of—
80646d There you are! The flag-folding ceremony's about to begin!
806003 Thank you, really. I've had a great time in both places today, but... [whispering, to Cutie Mark Crusaders] Wow. This must be how Terramar feels all the time.
80646f Oh! Hello, Sky Beak.
80646d Ocean Flow! You're looking well.
806000 [Hippogriffs and seaponies chattering happily]
806066 Hmmm... This gives me an idea.
806000 [water flowing]
806065 Huh. I thought for sure he came this way.
806066 [gasps] He did.
80646c And I'm staying here, too! That way, I don't have to be on land or in the water!
806065 We're sorry. We were supposed to help you, and...
806066 ...we just ended up confusing you more. It's all our fault.
80646c Oh, great! You're sorry, and I'm still confused! I'm staying in my tree.
80600a We might have somethin' worth comin' down for.
806066 We thought we'd get every creature together for a picnic on the beach.
806065 And we mean every creature!
806000 [Hippogriffs and seaponies chattering and cheering]
806000 [splashing]
806003 [laughing]
80646d Son! There you are! Your friends told us how you've been feeling.
80646f And we're sorry if we ever made you think you had to choose between worlds. That wasn't our intention, honey.
80646d Your Hippogriff heritage is something to be proud of, certainly.
80646f But you're more than just where you're from or who you live with. We love you because you're you, no matter where you choose to be.
80646d You don't have to decide. You can keep doing what you've been doing – going back and forth.
80646f And enjoying both places.
80646c [laughing]
806065 Something we forgot to add that both places have – family and friends who love you.
80646c Thanks for everything. Hey, uh, are you glowing?
806000 [shimmering sounds]
806080 Yes! We did it!
806003 Congratulations! Your first map mission is a success!
806066 Guess that means we're officially done here. I hope you come visit your sister in Equestria.
80600a Yeah, come see us! You'll love it!
806065 Who knows? You might even want to live there!
806000 [beat]
806065 Yeah, that was a joke.
806000 [credits]
807003 Princess Celestia, I have an idea for your ones-versary.
807019 My... "ones-versary"?
807003 The one-thousand, one-hundred, eleventh year anniversary of when you first raised the sun.
807005 Good thing Pinkie Pie reminded us, or we would have forgot to celebrate.
807019 You're not the only ones. What did you have in mind?
807003 To commemorate your first sunrise, I've written a play. We'd like to perform it at my School of Friendship, if you don't mind.
807019 [giggling happily] Mind? Oh! Of course not! Oh! I think a play is a fantastic idea!
807005 Did she just... prance?
807019 Oh, uh, forgive me for getting so excited. It's just, when I was a filly, my friends often put on plays. [sighs] It was so wonderful. Everypony coming together to create a magical experience to share with others. I've always believed theater brings out the best in us and forges a special bond of friendship.
807003 [gasps] I didn't know you used to act!
807019 Oh, not me. I was always too busy with my magic lessons to be part of any plays myself. But still, it's something I always wished I could experience.
807003 And you still can! Princess Celestia, we would be honored if you would be the star of our play!
807005 We would?!
807000 [theme song]
807019 You want me to star in your play?!
807005 Yeah... When did that happen, exactly?
807003 If you'll excuse us for a second... [whispering] Don't you see, Spike? It's perfect! Princess Celestia has always wanted to be in a play, and this one's about her!
807005 [whispering] I guess, but how are we supposed to give her directions? She's the ruler of Equestria!
807003 [whispering] She's also our friend. Celestia's always kind to everypony. So if we have a chance to finally do something for her, we should.
807005 Hmmm...
807003 [whispering] Come on. How many times has Celestia helped us? Guided us? Been a warm, calming voice over our shoulder?
807019 Twilight.
807049 Aah!
807003 Yes, Princess Celestia?
807019 Your invitation is very kind, but are you certain it's wise? I have no acting experience at all.
807003 Experience? Pssh! You'll be playing yourself. And we'll all help you. Please? It'd mean so much to the students if you were in our show.
807019 Well, if you're sure...
807005 Yeah, what she said.
807019 Then I would be delighted to join your theater troupe!
807000 [squeak]
807007 Woo-hoo! Confetti is ready! Woo-hoo!
807008 Puh! Wormy apple cores, Pinkie! How many times have I told you to keep your special effects away from my sets?!
807007 Three hundred twenty-seven. Oh! Unless you just did. Then it's three hundred twenty-eight. [squee]
807008 Ugh.
80727c I can't believe you've memorized your lines already, Fluttershy.
80700e Once you get past terrifying, paralyzing stage fright, the rest is easy. Now I just hope Princess Celestia says we can do our play.
80700d Oh, as soon as she sees these fabulous costumes, all she'll be able to say is "Brava!"
80700c Heads up! Here comes our answer!
807003 [panting] Wonderful news, everypony!
807008 Yeehaw! We get to put on our show?
807003 Even better. Princess Celestia is gonna be our star!
807470 [gasps]
807005 Yeah, that's how I felt, too.
80700c Celestia? Starring in our play? This is huge!
807003 Well, she was a little nervous at first, but I told her not to worry. With us helping, it will all go smooth as—
80700d Silk! I must find the silk! If Celestia's going to be in our play, we have to take everything up to the next level! None of these old ideas will do!
807000 [squeak]
807007 Yeah! Forget my regular party cannon! For princess-sized effects, we're gonna need Big Bertha!
807008 Grrrr...! Pinkie!
807007 What?
80700c Our play is gonna be amazing! I gotta tell everypony I know! And even the ones I don't!
807000 [whoosh, boom!]
807008 Why in tarnation are y'all gettin' so starstruck? We've met Princess Celestia before. Plenty of times.
80727c Those were formal things – galas, world-saving. This is different! Imagine doing sweaty warm-ups with a princess, blowing your nose in front of a princess, sitting around just... talking with a princess.
807003 I'm a princess. You talk to me.
80727c That's different. You're not a "princess" princess.
807003 Uh, thanks. Celestia wants to experience the special friendship that theater ponies have. To give her that, you just need to be yourselves.
80700e You... You really think so?
807008 Heh. Aw, quit frettin'. It's only a couple o' pals gettin' together to put on a ones-versary play. What could go wrong?
807005 [amplified] Places, everypony! We're here to rehearse "A New Day in Equestria"!
807003 [clears throat]
807005 [amplified] Directed, written, and produced by Twilight Sparkle.
807003 Page one, act one, scene one. Action!
807000 [curtains squeaking]
80700e Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard, it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.
807183 [straining]
807000 [clanking]
80700e And every day, the unicorns helping Star Swirl would use so much magic, they lost their powers forever. Things looked bleak. Soon, Equestria would lose all its magic users! Then, the land would be covered in darkness for eternity!
807000 [clanking]
807003 [to Spike] Even I can't believe how good my play is! The sets, the props, the outfits – they're all great!
807005 And... here comes the best part.
80700e But then, a student named Celestia discovered she had the power to raise the sun herself without draining her magic!
807000 [birds chirping]
807003 Um, that's your cue, Celestia.
807019 Oh! Uh, right! Of course! Heh. [clears throat] [quietly] It is time for a new day in Equestria.
807005 Um, what?
807019 Oh, uh, I said [quietly] it is time for a new day in Equestria.
807000 [beat]
807003 And your delivery was... great! But maybe you should try it a tiny bit louder for the ponies in the back row.
807019 Oh, yes, yes. My Royal Canterlot Voice. Thank you for the reminder, Twilight. [booming] It is time for a new day in Equestria!
807000 [birds squawking]
807019 Oh! Goodness! This theater does have strong acoustics. M-My apologies. I'm still learning to hone my craft.
807003 No, no! You're doing... fine! Why don't we try it one more time? Just like you're talking to me.
807019 [flat and stilted] It is time for a new day in Equestria-aaa.
807003 A bit more energy.
807019 [rushed and hyperactive] It's time for a new day in Equestria! [normal] Uh, how was that?
807008 Uh, honestly?
807000 [teleportation zap]
807008 [muffled]
807003 Great! Wow! It's hard to believe you've never done this before! Let's move onto the dance number!
807000 [dance music]
807005 Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Again! Step, buck, leap, touch! Got it? Movin' on! Five, six, seven, eight!
807019 [with wildly varying tone] Come on, Star Swirl. Throw off that must-Y hat and let's have a... a dance!
807000 [clanking]
807183 [yelps]
807000 [crash!]
807183 [groaning]
807019 Oh, dear. I think we have a problem!
807008 [whispering] Yeah. Our lead actress is a disaster!
807003 [hyperventilating] What are we gonna do?! If I tell Celestia she's terrible, it'll hurt her feelings, and I'll be a bad friend. But if I keep her in the show, she'll be the laughingstock of Equestria, and I'll be a worse friend.
807008 Ya need to tell Celestia the truth, Twilight.
807003 Any other suggestions?
807005 Why don't we just cancel the show?
807003 Real suggestions?
807005 No, think about it. Right now, most of Equestria doesn't even know we're doing a ones-versary play. If we shut it down...
80700d ...Nopony will ever miss it!
80727c So they'll never find out Princess Celestia's a bad actress!
80700e And she won't be embarrassed!
807007 Ah! It's the perfect plan!
80700c All right! I just finished telling everypony to come to our play!
807003 You... did?
80700c Yeah! You should've seen how excited they got when they found out Celestia was in it! They said they'd tell their friends, and then their friends would tell their friends! Everypony in Equestria's gonna see this thing! Uh... did I miss something?
807003 Just the bright light of hope being snuffed. But that's okay. If we can't cancel the show, I know what I have to do.
807008 Be honest with Celestia and give the lead role to somepony else?
807003 Not a chance!
807008 Twilight, you know truth is a huge part of friendship.
807003 And so is making another pony's dreams come true. Look, I promised Celestia that this time, she could be a part of the play instead of just watching it. And I plan to keep that promise.
80700e But how?
807019 You want to give me acting lessons?
807003 No-no-no-no-no-no-no. More like a special workshop with other actors. To... take your performance from good to flawless.
807019 Thank you so much, Twilight! This is what I always knew theater must be about – that special stage pony bond of shared trust and honesty.
807005 Yeah. Heh. That's what it is. Ahem.
807000 [doors open]
807003 Princess Celestia, meet Method Mare performers On Stage and Raspberry Beret!
8072e0 Avec pleasure, your Majesty!
807019 The pleasure is all mine! If there's anything I can do to become a better Equestrian thespian, I will! What do you have planned?
8072e0 I thought we'd make it up as we go along. [chuckles] Otherwise known as improvisation!
8072e1 Yes, and we can start as soon as we get out of this box.
807019 What box?
807003 [distressed whimper]
807000 [clattering]
807003 How's it going over here?
80700c That sun will never rise again.
807007 That's why I have something even better!
807000 [zip!]
80700d [gasps] It's the perfect substitute!
807000 [pop!]
807000 [balloon deflating]
80700d It was the perfect substitute.
807003 [sighs]
807000 [teleportation zap]
807003 Please give me something to be happy about.
8072e0 Let's try visualization! And... you're skiing!
8072e1 Whoosh! Whoosh! Oh, it's so snowy today! Brrr! I'm getting chilly!
807019 Should I get you a blanket?
8072e0 All aboard! The Ponyville Express is leaving the station! Whoo-whoo! Chugga-chugga-chugga-chugga...
807019 It is? But I don't see anything.
8072e1 Let's be weeping willows in the wind! We are strong in adversity yet supple as we bow to fate.
8072e0 Well? What do you feel?
807019 Mmmm... nothing. Oh! The classroom floor under my hooves! Does that count?
807000 [clunk]
807000 [teleportation zap]
807003 Do I wanna know?
807000 [clanking]
807007 Wait for it...
807000 [flames crackling]
807008 Pinkie Pie!
807000 [splash!]
807007 Whaaaat? It's realistic! The sun is just like a burning marshmallow!
807000 [water dripping]
807000 [whirring]
807003 What are they doing now?
807005 [sighs] The simplest acting exercise they could think of – a game of charades.
8072e1 A puppy! A duck-billed platypus! Antidisestablishmentarianism! Oh, I give up! What?!
807019 My love for Equestria and all the ponies in it! Twilight, you felt what I was emoting, didn't you?
807003 [stuttering] Yeah!
807005 [to On Stage] Now, that's the best acting we've seen all day.
807000 [indistinct chattering, orchestra tuning up]
807003 Okay! I tried and tried and tried! But we have to face facts. We can't make Celestia an actress. So there's only one thing to do!
807008 Tell her the truth finally?
807003 No!
807470 [groans]
807000 [teleportation zap]
807003 I've rewritten the script to give Celestia a more artistic part with no lines.
807007 And to make sure the show's a hit, I've whipped up the biggest, bestest, flashiest fake sun ever!
807471 [gasps]
807000 [fuses sizzling]
807003 Uh, Pinkie? That looks unsafe.
807007 Why would untested magic fireworks that I bought in a back alley from Trixie at midnight be unsafe?
807000 [fireworks exploding]
807000 [boom!]
807003 [coughing]
807000 [water splashing]
807000 [crash!]
807007 [blows]
807003 [anguished shriek] I can't take it anymore! It was supposed to be a simple play! Just one simple play! And then everything goes wrong, from the stage to the props, right down to the worst! Lead! Actress! In Equestria! [panting]
807000 [curtain flapping]
807472 [gasps]
807003 [gasps]
807019 Twilight, if you honestly thought I was a bad actress, why didn't you tell me?
807003 I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to insult your acting! It's just, I-I got so stressed! But... that's no excuse for what I said. You have every right to be upset with me.
807019 I'm not upset because you insulted my acting.
807003 You're not?
807019 I'm upset because, in all the time we've known each other, I thought I taught you about the importance of friendship, trust, and honesty!
807003 Celestia, wait!
807007 No!
807000 [thud]
807007 You can't fly away now! Look!
80700e Ponies are taking their seats for the show.
80700c [laughs] Standing room only! Did I do a good job of advertising for this thing or what? Sorry.
80727c We can't put on a show with no lead actress!
807008 You go find Celestia. We'll figure out a way to stall this thing 'til you get back.
807005 Good luck. Nopony's gonna volunteer to try to tame that.
80700d No pony indeed.
807005 [gulps]
807005 So... [chuckles nervously] Ahem. Uh, who likes juggling?
807003 Princess Celestia! Please wait! Can we talk?
807019 I'm afraid I haven't much to say, Twilight.
807003 All right then. Just listen. You've guided me since I was a filly. You've given me knowledge and advice and friendship. Just once, I wanted to be able to give something back to you. I know what I did was wrong. I should've told you the truth. But I promised you could be in our play. I had to make it work. Nothing would make me feel worse than knowing I disappointed you.
807019 You really mean that?
807003 Of course! I look up to you more than any pony I've ever met! I hate to let you down. Like I did.
807019 [sighs] You had good intentions, Twilight. But you know that the truth is always better than a well-meant lie. Didn't Applejack remind you?
807003 [sighs] About a hundred times. And now, because I didn't listen to her, I've ruined your whole ones-versary.
807019 Well... I don't know about that. Isn't there an old saying? "The show must go on"? There may be a way for us to save the play yet.
807003 But how? I mean, if I'm being completely honest... you're not an actress.
807019 No. But I am a princess.
807000 [crowd booing]
807005 Ugh! Good news – free food. [chewing] Bad news – this play is officially a disaster.
807019 Fortunately, I know a thing or two about how to deal with those.
80727c You came back!
807019 Yes. But let's celebrate later. Right now, we have a show to do!
80700d But... but... but how?! The audience is about to riot! We have no backdrop! And our lead actress is—!
807000 [squeak]
80700d Uhhhh...
807019 No longer in that role. Rarity, Applejack, Pinkie, Twilight, go calm the audience. Let them know the play will start in just a minute.
807000 [teleportation zap]
807019 Rainbow Dash, bring us some clouds and place them behind the stage. There, that's our new backdrop. Starlight, do you have a copy of the script?
807000 [magic zap]
807019 Spike, you narrate the play. Fluttershy will be our new lead.
80700e Oh, my. Me? Playing you? While you watch me playing you? Oh, no. Oh, no. I think my stage fright is coming back. [hyperventilating]
807019 Visualize with me. You're a princess. Regal. Commanding. Confident. Feel the rising sun's warmth. Equestria needs you.
807005 Once upon a time, before Celestia, Equestria was suffering terrible hardship. Raising the sun every morning was so hard that it took five great sorcerers plus Star Swirl the Bearded to do it.
807000 [crowd laughing]
8073f8 You call those great sorcerers?
807003 Oh, no! Hecklers! What should we do?
807019 [whispering] Spike! Improvise!
807005 Y-Yes. And, uh... raising the sun each day was super draining. But you can see that for yourselves, right? I mean, do these guys look beat-up or what? Star Swirl's so stressed, he's got kinks in his horn!
807000 [crowd laughing]
807005 But that's okay. 'Cause it turns out Celestia had a special power to raise the sun all by herself!
80700e It's time for a new day in Equestria!
807000 [beat]
807003 Ah! In all the commotion, we forgot we don't have a sun! What do we do?!
807019 We play charades.
807000 [crowd ooh-ing and ahh-ing]
807000 [crowd cheering]
8072e0 My goodness! I had no idea this production would have such elaborate special effects!
807019 Judging by how many flowers the audience threw, it seems our play was a success.
80700e I just feel bad you never got a chance to actually be in it.
807019 You shouldn't. I never felt I had to be on stage to be a part of the show. All I ever wanted was to share an honest bond of creativity, artistry, and happiness with my friends. And that's exactly what I got to do.
807003 Thank you for saving our play, Princess Celestia.
807019 You're welcome, Twilight. But from now on, none of you will have to call me "Princess" anymore.
807049 Huh?
807005 Wait, what? We don't?
807019 No. I had so much fun tonight, I've decided to give up my crown, step down from the throne, and devote all of my time to the theater!
807003 Y-You... what?!
807019 Gotcha! Maybe I'm not such a bad actress after all.
80704d [laughing]
807000 [credits]
808000 [knocking on door]
808473 [sighs]
808000 [knocking on door]
808000 [pounding on door]
808000 [door opens]
808473 [clears throat] Morning, Sunburst.
808315 What? Oh! Hi! [chuckles nervously] You know, no matter how many times I read it, Houyhnhnm's Guide to Magical Arcana never gets boring.
808473 If you say so. I've got another letter for you. From Sire's Hollow.
808315 Mm-hmm. Sure thing.
808000 [door closes]
808473 [groans]
808000 [thud]
808000 [shimmering sounds]
808315 What's this? Could I be experiencing the cerebration transmogrification effect described in chapter seventeen—?
808000 [thud]
808315 Oh. My cutie mark is glowing. My cutie mark is glowing! I know what this means! Why am I yelling?!
808000 [theme song]
808315 Princess Twilight, what an honor this is! I-I mean, it is, right? I'm called for a friendship mission?
808003 You sure are. And it must be a special one. Nopony outside of Ponyville has ever been called before.
808005 If you need some pointers, let me know. I've been on my fair share of missions.
808003 You've been on one, Spike.
808005 And that's my fair share.
808000 [door opens]
808315 Starlight! You mean we've both been called? This is great!
80827c [depressed] Yeah... Great...
808315 Aren't you excited? You and me on a mission together!
80827c [groans]
808315 I'm... sorry. Are you not excited to go on a mission with me?
80827c No. Uh, no! I mean, yes. Heh. Totally excited about us going together. Just... not so excited about where.
808315 Sire's Hollow?
80827c Yep. Home.
808315 [deflated] Oh. Great.
808005 You know, I can go if you two don't want to. I am kind of an expert.
808474 [groans]
808000 [train chugging]
808000 [indistinct conversations]
80827c [sighs] It's not that I don't want to go home. It's just that whenever I do, my dad treats me like a filly. Like nothing's changed since I was a foal.
808315 Huh.
80827c I know. I'm a horrible daughter.
808315 N-No, no! My mom actually does kind of the same thing.
80827c Really?
808315 I don't even have to go home. She sends me letters constantly asking about my plans for the future. [imitating Stellar Flare] "You're a grown-up pony, Sunburst! You need a plan!" [sighs] I haven't been home in a while either.
80827c Hmph. We'll just have to explain to our parents that we're on an important friendship mission so they can't bother us.
808315 Do you really think that will work?
80827c Nope!
808000 [brakes hissing]
808000 [train whistle]
808000 [train chugging]
808315 [sniffs, sighs] The great thing about home is it always stays just how you le—
808000 [thud]
808315 Augh!
80827c Where did that come from?
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
808476 Essence?
808315 Essence of what?
808476 You tell me.
808000 [spritz]
808315 [coughing]
80827c What is it?
808315 Uh... chocolate maybe?
808476 Not chocolate maybe. Chocolate definitely! And all of the benefits with none of the drawbacks.
808315 Didn't this used to be a fruit stand?
808476 I don't know what it used to be. The Sire's Hollow Development Committee determined what it is.
808315 The Sire's Hollow Development what? Where do ponies buy fruit?
808476 You can get a fruit smoothie two doors down.
808315 All the shops are different. Everything's changed!
80827c Not everything. That's the same as it ever was.
808000 [door opens]
808477 Sorry. Our bookstore's been declared a site of historical significance by the Sire's Hollow Preservation Society.
808478 You'll have to experience the books from here. That's why windows are see-through.
808000 [door slams]
808315 What?!
80827c Preservation Society? What is happening around here?
808479 I'll explain it to you, sugarplum! [chuckles] You are just as cutesy-wutesy as ever!
80827c [muffled] Dad! [normally] Quit it! What is going on?
808479 Oh, just a father wanting to preserve our town's rich history for his little pumpky-wumpkin! [chuckles]
80827c Dad, you promised no "pumpky-wumpkin"'s in public!
808315 [stifled laughter]
808479 [whispering] Sorry, chipmunk cheeks.
808000 [smack!]
80827c Don't. You're preserving the whole town? That's crazy!
80847a That's exactly what I told him! I said, "Firelight, you're crazy!"
808315 Mom?
80847a Our village needs the same thing you do, Sunburst – a clear plan for the future.
808000 [snip!]
80847a That's why I started the Sire's Hollow Development Committee. And I've got plans for this little town. Big plans!
808479 Listen here, Stellar Flare! I'm not gonna let you turn our historical heritage into Las Pegasus!
80847a And I'm not gonna let you turn it into a museum!
80847b [growling]
80827c W-Wait. Are you two fighting over this?
808315 Like having a friendship problem?
80847a Oh, there's no problem.
808479 Because there is no friendship!
808315 Well, the good news is we know why we're here.
80827c [huffs]
808315 [sighs] Maybe we should've sent Spike after all.
80827c [sighs]
808000 [magic sounds]
80827c Sunburst and I were called here to do a job, and it looks like you two are it.
80847a You mean your success depends on us?
808315 Uh...
808479 And you have to hang out with us the whole time you're here?!
80827c Um...
80847a Well, I'll hear what you have to say. But every plan I've made for this town is perfectly reasonable.
808479 Good luck convincing me my preservation efforts don't make sense.
80847c [sighs]
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
80827c So we can't hold the books?
808477 [laughing] No!
808315 Can you hold the books?
808478 No.
80827c So nopony can read the books?
808479 [chuckles] Isn't she adorable? [chuckles]
808000 [gate clanking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
808476 You can call them... mm... "smells". But I call them essence!
808000 [spritz]
808315 [coughing]
80827c [sniffs] Fruity.
808315 Too bad there's nowhere to get actual fruit.
80847a In the future, all ponies will drink their fruit!
80847c [slurping]
80827c [coughing]
808000 [thud]
80847d One hundred percent ancient pony grains! Just like the town founders ate! Hope you like crust!
808000 [crunch, thud]
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's Hollow!
808000 [gate creaking]
808475 Welcome to Sire's—!
80847a Okay, it's annoying. I get it.
808479 Maybe my preservation efforts were a little over the top.
808000 [crash!]
80847d [groans] Oh, no.
80847a And I might have been trying to turn the town into a shopping mall.
808479 Well, whatever direction the town takes from now on, how about we work together on it?
80847a Deal! Sunburst, you should move closer to Ponyville. After this success, I'm sure the Princess of Friendship will want to send you on more missions.
808000 [smack!]
808315 That's not really how it works. Oh, look at the time! We should get going now that we solved the friendship problem, right, Starlight?
80827c Yeah... The thing is, I don't think we did solve it. When we solve a friendship problem, our cutie marks are supposed to glow.
808479 Aw, don't be disappointed, puddin'. Your papa will work this out for ya.
80827c Heh. My papa wasn't called by the map in Twilight's castle. I was.
80847a How are you gonna explain this to the princess? What's your plan if she fires you from friendship quests?
808315 Mom! She doesn't—! It-It's not—!
80847a Use your words, Sunburst.
808315 [angry groan]
80827c I guess you two weren't the problem we were sent to solve after all.
80847a So now you don't even know why you're here? Ah! We have to figure this out before we run out of time!
808315 [sighs] Mom, there isn't a time limit.
808479 So you're here for an extra long visit? [laughs] You can stay in your old room, punkie wunk! It's just like you left it!
808000 [guitar riff]
80827c [whispering] We need to find this friendship problem now!
808479 Now, I know you have your little job to do, but Stellar and I know the town a lot better than you two.
80847a That's right! Neither of you have been home in ages. You're gonna need our help to succeed!
80827c I guess that makes sense...
80847b [chuckling]
80847a I already have some ideas!
808479 Me, too!
808315 I think I liked it better when they were fighting.
808000 [chalk tapping]
808479 Okay! Now that I've explained how Sire's Hollow was founded, we can start to explore all the possible friendship problems that might have developed over time.
80827c [inhales] I appreciate the history lesson, Dad, but I need to find the problem now. In the present.
808479 Aw, now, hon-bun. How are you gonna do that without all the backstory, huh? Oh! Of course I know how hard it is for you to sit still and focus, soooo... would it help you pay attention to hold on to your bwankie?
80827c [growling]
80847a Now, you've had a little setback. But don't worry. I know exactly what you need to do.
808315 Make a plan?
80847a Already got one! Step one – interview the suspects. Step two – use your talents to solve the issue. Step three – get the Princess of Friendship to send you on more missions!
808315 Mom! It does not work like that!
80847a Uh-huh.
808000 [beat]
80847a [clears throat]
808476 [poorly acted] Oh! Thank goodness you are here! These two ponies refuse to use my essences.
808477 Maybe because we don't like to cover our natural scent!
80847a [clears throat irritably]
808476 Ugh.
808477 Ugh.
808478 [sighs] [poorly acted] And she refuses to buy our books.
80847e [poorly acted] Surely this is a friendship problem.
808315 Ugh! It needs to be a real friendship problem! You can't just make one up! [angry groan]
80847a This is what happens when we don't rehearse! Ugh!
808479 Starlight? Sweetie? I found a really old town bylaw that nopony agrees on. Apparently, we're not supposed to prance or canter after dinnertime. Could that be the problem? Silly-filly?
80827c Whew! What are you doing?
808315 [sighs] Hiding from my mother. She started making up friendship problems for me to solve.
80827c [scoffs] My dad won't even let me talk to anypony in case they're "strangers". I'm a grown mare!
808315 [sighs] We're never going to find the friendship problem with them around, let alone solve it.
80847d Maybe you two should start looking for it on your own? [crunching]
808000 [lamp clicks]
80827c [whispering] Okay! So we wanted to talk to all of you, you know, in private.
808315 [whispering] Just to see if there were issues any of you had with your friends.
808476 [whispering] Got it. Just one question. Why are we whispering?
80847d They're avoiding their parents.
80847e Ohhhh... [various agreement]
808315 No. Not avoiding. Just... taking a break.
80827c Yeah. We needed to focus. B-But we're definitely not avoiding them.
808477 So you're whispering with all of us in the darkest corner of the shop where nopony can possibly see because you're not avoiding them?
80827c Mm-hmm.
808315 Uh, but they definitely can't hear us in here, right?
80847d No way! This is the antiquities section. Nopony ever comes back here.
808479 There you are! But what are you doing in here? [gasps] Is the friendship problem in my favorite section of the bookstore?
80847c [groans]
808479 ...And then, I thought the best way to look for a friendship problem in the present...
80827c Dad!
808479 ...was to look back in our town history even farther!
80827c [angry groan]
80847a Sunburst! Oh, finally! Now, I know you don't want me to make up a problem, but what if I start one?
808315 That's not how this—!
80847a I mean, nopony ever became a success by following all the rules, right?
808315 [nickers angrily]
80847a [to Firelight] How are things on your end?
808479 Couldn't be better! New leads and such!
80827c Guys...?
80847a We really are providing excellent assistance, aren't we?
808315 Guys!
808479 I dare say our children should be grateful for our help.
80827c Guys!
80847c We don't want your help!
80847a I'm sorry. You don't want our help?
808479 [chuckles] That's... That's ridiculous! What reason could you possibly have for that?
80827c Because you're driving us crazy!
80847a Oh, really? And just how am I driving you crazy?
808315 By always coming up with plans! I don't need a plan! I mean, maybe I do, but it'll be mine, not yours!
80847a [choking up] Well... I'm sorry for trying to help! [crying]
80827c And you're not any better! I'm not a filly! I'm a grown pony with a job to do, and I'll do it on my own!
808479 Well. I'll let you get to it then.
80827c Great. Now we have to smooth things over with our parents on top of finding and solving a friendship problem.
808315 It's almost like our relationship with our parents is the friendship problem.
80827c You don't think that's it, do you?
80847d [clears throat] That's what all of us think.
80827c [groans, collapses] Why couldn't we have been sent to stop a war or something?!
80827c Dad?
808479 Hello, Ms. Glimmer. How is your friendship problem search going? I only ask as an interested observer, since I know you are an adult who's capable of doing things without help from anypony else. [whimpers]
80827c Actually... I think Sunburst and I figured out what it is.
808479 So Stellar and I weren't really helpful after all.
80827c Well, we haven't actually solved it. And I don't think we can. Not without you.
80847a [sniffs]
808000 [spritz]
80847a [coughing] Pungent. Ugh. [to Sunburst] Oh. Did you come by to be driven crazy by more of your mother's plans?
808315 No, I came to apologize.
80847a Well, it's going to take more than an apology to make up for telling me you don't want my help finding your friendship problem.
808315 Oh, I'm not sorry for that. Starlight and I already figured out what the problem is.
80847a This is a terrible apology.
808315 Well, if you come with me and help fix it, I'll give you a better one.
80827c Usually, Twilight or one of our other friends gets called to a place with a friendship problem to fix.
808315 But Starlight and I realized we came here to fix a friendship problem we already had.
80827c I'm sorry I've been avoiding coming home, Dad. But you can't keep treating me like a foal.
808479 I'm sorry, sugarbun. [sighs] I just know how hard things were for you when you left home. I guess I wanted you to feel safe, like... when you were young.
80827c Dad, I know I've made some mistakes, and I'll probably make a bunch more. But I learn from them. I think that's what growing up is.
808315 I'm sorry I never told you how much your plans bothered me, and I know you just want me to succeed. But I need to do that on my own.
80847a I remember how lost you were when you flunked out of magic school. I thought as long as you had a plan, you'd never feel that way again.
808315 You don't have to worry, Mom. I need to find my own way. And I definitely don't feel lost anymore.
808000 [shimmering sounds]
80847d [crying] That's so beautiful!
80847a The glowing cutie mark is such a symbol of accomplishment. I don't suppose there's a way for you to get it to glow all the time.
808315 [chuckles] Pretty sure it doesn't work that way.
80827c Not unless we solved a friendship problem every few seconds, and I kinda hope this one will be it for a while.
808479 You know, it seems to me your map is saying we're not just your parents. Heh. We're your friends, too.
80827c I guess so.
808479 So if I promise to treat you less like a little filly and more like a friend, will you visit more?
80827c Absolutely. Mmm.
808315 And if you start to drive me crazy again, I'll tell you instead of never coming home.
80847a That's lovely of you to say, dear. But you know, I can always visit you.
808479 Stellar, you're a genius! [laughs] How do you feel about a road trip?
80847a I might have a few plans for that.
80847c [chuckling nervously]

808000 [credits]
809000 [whooshing]
809000 [papers fluttering]
809187 Huh?
809000 [whooshing]
809185 Whoa!
80900c Did I miss the Teacher of the Month announcement?
809008 You're just in time. But it's gonna be me.
80900c Yeah, right. I got this one nailed.
809003 And the Friendship School Teacher of the Month is... Fluttershy!
809008 [groans] Again?
80900c Come on!
80900e Oh, my! I don't know how I keep winning.
809000 [camera flashes]
80900c Yeah. Me, neither.
809003 The award is based on the students' vote. They must really like you.
809000 [beat]
809003 Congratulations, Fluttershy!
80900e [giggles]
809003 Next item of business – I've been looking into a new activity for our friendship classes. Spike?
809000 [pages flapping]
809003 Section one-forty-seven, paragraph two states that teamwork is a key part of friendship. And section two-two-nine, paragraph nine says outdoor activity reinforces learning. Add that together, and what do you get?
809007 Ooh, ooh! Okay, let me see. One-forty-seven, two-twenty-nine, carry the two... Three hundred and eighty-seven?
809003 Mm-mm. A teamwork field trip. Leading it is a Teacher of the Month-type job, so I thought I'd ask—
809008 I'm your pony, Twilight! Sweet Apple Acres has taught me a thing or two about workin' together.
80900c Yeah, but being a Wonderbolt's the definition of teamwork.
809008 [chuckles] I'm sure you're not sayin' fancy flyin' makes ya a better choice than me.
80900c [chuckles] I wouldn't say "better". Just a little more qualified. No offense.
80900e Maybe you can lead the field trip together.
809008 [stutters]
80900c [stutters]
809003 Of course! Who better to model the importance of working as a team?
809007 Um, Rarity? Fluttershy? Me? Spike? This flowerpot?
809003 Both of you are teamwork experts. If the students see the two of you teaching together, they'll learn even more. I know you've been competitive in the past, but I'm sure you'd never let that get in the way of friendship education.
809008 Of course!
80900c Totally!
80901d [groans, chuckles]
809000 [theme song]
809189 I've never been on a field trip before.
809186 Yeah, what's the point of this exactly?
809184 Getting out of the classroom. Duh.
809187 Yak best at field-tripping! [grunts]
809185 That's what we're doing?! So fun! [grunts]
809188 [chuckles] Pretty sure the headmare has something else in mind.
809003 All right, class. Today you'll learn how important working together is for building a strong friendship.
809008 Hey, y'all! Ready to get out there and do some learnin' the Apple family way?
80900c This is basically gonna be the best field trip in the history of ever! With me in charge, that is. Whoa!
809008 [chuckles nervously] With us in charge. Meanin' mostly me.
80900c Yeah. Good one.
809003 And what teamwork activity do you two have planned for today?
809008 Applejack:
809008 Shed buildin'!
80900c Rainbow Dash:
80900c Canoe racing!
809185 No... way. We get to do both?!
809003 I bet that's exactly what your teachers had in mind. Why don't you start with shed building first?
809008 Heh. Don't mind if I do! Everycreature, follow the leader!
809003 I'll check in later to see how it's going. Remember to work together!
809008 [deep inhale] Now take a good, deep breath. What do you smell?
809184 [inhale] Uh, yak?
809187 [sniffing] Mm-hmm!
809008 Nope. Try again.
809189 Um, apples?
809008 And...? Anyone? Anyone? No? The promise of... teamwork! That there's an apple shed. And this here is what we're gonna use to build it. Nothin' brings friends together like a little hard work and honest sweat.
80900c [laughing] Sweat? Seriously? That's supposed to be part of friendship?
809008 Not everypony would know that, Rainbow Dash. Just "Teacher of the Month" kind o' ponies.
80900c Whatever. Let's just get this done so we can move on to my activity.
809000 [montage music]
809000 [hammering]
809000 [sawing]
809008 That's it! Measure twice and cut once! Haste makes waste! Slow and steady!
80900c Emphasis on the slow.
809000 [whoosh]
809000 [thudding]
80900c [grunting]
809008 Rainbow Dash! Ya can't build an apple shed like that!
80900c [scoffs] Oh, yeah? I just did!
809000 [thud]
809188 Whoa! No way!
80947f Whoa!
809184 Impressive... if you can call an apple shed impressive.
809008 Just 'cause it's fast don't mean it's good!
80900c Oh, sorry, can't hear you. Too busy practicing my "Teacher of the Month" pose. [grunting]
809008 Don't count your pictures before they're snapped, Rainbow Dash.
80900c Oh, come on! These students are totally gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done!
809008 No! They're gonna vote for a teacher who gets things done right!
809186 Yeah... This isn't awkward at all...
809000 [montage music continues]
809000 [wood creaking]
809000 [hammering]
809008 Steady... Steady... Take 'er nice and slow...
809000 [creaking]
809008 Little to the left...
809000 [creaking]
809008 Uh, a hair to the right...
809000 [creaking]
809008 Now, a hoof shavin' higher...
809000 [creaking]
80900c [growls] Just bring it down already!
809480 [yelps]
809008 [yelps]
809000 [crash]
80900c [chuckles nervously]
809008 I'll give ya one guess whose side is still standin'.
809187 Yak side! [grunts]
809000 [thud]
809187 [chuckles nervously] Uh...
809008 [sighs]
809189 Um, professors? I'm a little confused about teamwork now.
80900c That's because you need a different teacher. Follow me! Last one to the stream is a rotten apple shed!
809008 [growls]
80900c Who's ready to smash the all-time Equestria speed record for river canoeing?!
809000 [cricket chirping]
809184 Is that even a thing?
809188 First I've heard of it.
80900c We need to get to the finish line before this alarm goes off. That means you gotta move fast! Any questions?
809187 Uh, Yona has questions.
80900c No time for 'em! Get in the boat!
809008 You really think winnin' some canoein' record is gonna get you that Teacher of the Month trophy?
80900c I'm pretty sure everycreature's gonna like it a lot better than pounding nails and cutting wood.
809000 [splashing]
809187 Yak not like water.
809189 Sometimes, when I'm scared to try something new, I whistle.
809187 [weak whistling]
809184 We got you, Yona.
809187 [yelping]
809000 [thud]
809008 Way I see it, Twilight's gonna give that teachin' trophy to a teacher, not a racer.
80900c We'll see about that.
80900c Stroke! Stroke! Stroke! Harder! Put your backs into it, newbies!
809008 Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Stroooooke... Slower... Focus on your paddle technique, y'all.
809185 Woo-hoo! We're really going now!
809186 So... when do we get to the part when we move?
809000 [water splashing]
80900c When everycreature starts listening to me, the leader of my activity, Applejack! Now stroke!
809000 [water splashing]
809000 [water rushing]
809000 [watch ticking]
80900c Dig in, team! We can still beat that record!
809008 Stop!
80900c Go!
809189 Which way do we go?
80900c Left!
809008 Right!
809185 Aye-aye, captains! Wait, what?
80900c Left! I can see the finish line from here!
809008 If we go left, we'll be headin' straight into the bite-acuda fish!
80900c Who cares about a few fish?
809188 Uh, professors?
809008 You'll care plenty when they bite ya!
809188 Guys?
80900c We'll just go around them!
809188 Rock!
80904d [screaming]
809000 [crash!]
809000 [water rushing]
80904d [gasping, coughing]
809185 [giggling]
809187 [panicked whistling] Oof! [grunting]
809000 [rip!]
809185 I love field trips!
809008 I hope you're happy.
80900c [scoffs] Obviously not! Because there goes our new speed record!
809187 [panicked whistling, coughing] Help! Yak not swim!
809000 [transformation zap]
809189 That's okay! Your friends can change into creatures that do!
809187 [panicked whistling, coughing]
809003 How's the canoeing... going?
809186 About as good as the apple shed building.
80900c I totally had things under control until Applejack messed 'em up!
809008 I did not!
80900c Did too!
809008 Did not!
809184 Yup. It's been like this all day.
809188 I wouldn't say all day. Just... ninety-nine percent of it.
809003 I can't believe this! You're not teaching teamwork! You're competing with each other! I thought you were past that!
80900c We are! Mostly.
809008 We got carried away with wantin' to be the Teacher of the Month is all.
809003 The Teacher of the Month wouldn't care about being the Teacher of the Month! I know Fluttershy would be thrilled to see another pony win. That's it! I'm taking over this field trip!
809008 H-Hold up, Twilight. Don't count out Rainbow Dash for the award just yet. You shoulda seen her fire up those students to build a shed.
80900c No way! You're the one the students listen to. Besides, you saved us from those pony-eating fish.
809000 [beat]
80900c Uh, long story. But Applejack should definitely be Teacher of the Month.
809003 Hmmm... Maybe you two have learned something, after all.
809008 Does that mean you'll give us another chance at the Teacher of the— [muffled]
80900c Field trip?
809003 Well...
80900c Come on, Twilight. We get it. No more arguing. Right, Applejack?
809008 Right as rain and twice as fresh!
809000 [hoof-bump]
809003 Fine. But I'm picking the next activity you two lead. A nature walk. Nopony could possibly argue over that. Right?
80901d Right!
809008 See? We're agreein' already.
809008 Well, look at that. The path splits up ahead. Left or right?
809186 Ugh. Here we go again.
809008 Where to, Rainbow Dash?
80900c I was thinking right... unless you want to go left. Because what makes you happy makes me happy.
809008 Aw, heck. Forget about me. You want to go right, we'll go right.
80900c But teamwork means listening to other ponies, so it's up to you.
809008 Well, aren't you as sweet as sugar apple pie? But it's up to you.
809187 Ugh! Follow me! Yak know best way!
809008 Hey! Where are y'all goin'?
809000 [montage music]
809189 I think we've gone in the same circle five times.
809188 Only because someponies won't make up their minds about which way to go.
80900c Do you want to keep going in a circle, Applejack?
809008 Up to you, Rainbow Dash. I insist.
80900c [chuckles] No, no. I insist.
809008 Heh. But I insisted first.
809185 Are we still on a field trip? 'Cause this just feels like being lost.
809186 Ugh.
809000 [whoosh]
809186 We can still get back to school before dark if we cross that ravine and stop doubling back.
80900c We knew that. All part of our plan. Right, Applejack?
809008 Uh, yup! All we have to do is, uh... build a bridge 'cross that, uh, giant canyon, and we're home free. That is, if-if you think a bridge is a good idea.
80900c Only if you want to build a bridge.
809184 Stop! Listen. We can just fly everyone over and be done.
809008 Nope! There's still plenty o' time to teach y'all a lesson in teamwork.
80900c Cooperation!
809008 Togetherness!
80900c You are so right!
809008 Only as right as you are!
809186 Okay! We'll build a bridge! What do we use?
809008 Applejack:
809008 Branches!
80900c Rainbow Dash:
80900c Vines!
809000 [beat]
809008 Applejack:
809008 Vines!
80900c Rainbow Dash:
80900c Branches!
809008 I'm goin' with your idea! Vines! No buts about it!
80900c I-I'm building with your idea! Branches! End of story!
809000 [montage music]
809189 [yawns]
809000 [crickets chirping]
809008 [muffled] Why use a branch when you can use a vine? [grunting] Whoa!
809183 [gasps]
809008 [grunting]
809183 [sighs]
809000 [crack]
80900c Why didn't I think of branches to begin with? They're so— [yelping] ...easy to work with.
809183 [gasps]
809000 [wind whistling]
809008 [muffled] Come on now... [grunting] These here vines are just the thing, Rainbow Dash!
80900c Not to disagree, but these here branches are the way to— [screams]
809008 [screams]
80901d [screaming] Help!
809189 Uh, at least now they're agreeing on something.
809000 [vines creaking]
80900c [grunting] I can't get out!
809008 Let me try. [grunting]
809000 [vines creaking]
809000 [teeth snapping]
80900c Let me guess. Bite-acudas?
809000 [splashing]
809008 Mm-hmm.
809000 [teeth snapping]
809008 And they look mighty hungry.
809188 We gotta get our professors out of there! Anycreature have a plan?
809184 Leave 'em hangin'?
809185 What?!
809184 I'm kidding! ...Kinda.
809189 We need to work fast! And together!
809000 [vines snapping]
809186 But mainly fast.
809008 I hate to admit it, but—
809000 [vines snapping]
809008 ...this whole mess is kinda our fault.
80900c Yeah. No trophy is worth getting eaten over.
809008 So what do ya say? You want to team up and get ourselves out of this here pickle barrel?
80900c I thought you'd never ask.
80901d [screams]
809189 Aah! Don't worry. I'm just the distraction.
80900c Ocellus?!
809008 [sighs] You nearly scared the cutie marks off us!
809000 [splashing]
809189 [roars, chomp-chomp]
809000 [splashing]
809000 [vines snapping]
80901d [screaming]
809185 Need a lift?
809187 Yak smash! [grunting]
809188 [grunting]
809186 [grunting]
809187 [laughing, grunting]
809188 Welcome back, professors!
80900c Now, that was a rescue!
809008 And y'all did it together!
809183 [cheering]
809184 No big. Those fish weren't even a thing.
809189 [growls]
809184 [screams]
809189 [chuckles] Oops. Sorry.
809185 [giggles] Best... field trip... ever!
809000 [door opens]
809003 Huh? How was the field trip? What did you all learn?
80901d Uhhhh...
809187 Yak learn ponies smart!
809185 Yeah! Professors Applejack and Rainbow Dash were such good teachers!
809184 It was kind of crazy genius. They showed us what not to do so we'd figure out what we should do.
809003 Really...?
809188 It took us a while to get it.
809186 Especially at the ravine. It would've been so much easier to just fly home.
809185 But instead, our professors built bridges the wrong way just to show us how important teamwork is.
809184 Yeah. That was super dangerous. Talk about commitment.
809189 We know it's too early to pick the Teacher of the Month. But we'd like you to consider Rainbow Dash and Applejack.
809003 Thank you for telling me. I'm so glad to hear your field trip was a success. I'll make sure to schedule another one right away.
809183 [cheering]
809003 [to Rainbow Dash and Applejack] You were actually just competing the entire time, weren't you?
809008 To tell you the truth... yeah.
80900c Well, not all the time. I agreed with you for the whole nature walk.
809008 Only 'cause you were anglin' for that Teacher of the Month award!
809003 [groans]
80900c You were the one doing the "angling"!
809008 [scoffs] You were more like fandanglin'!
80900c Rainbow Dash:
80900c What does that even mean?! No one here can understand your country bumpkin talk...!
809008 Applejack:
809008 Look, we all live in the same town here...!
809000 [credits]
810000 [oven timer ticks]
810026 [groans]
810005 You said it, Big Mac. This is taking forever! I know it's wrong to cut corners when it comes to gifts from the heart, but this is an emergency, right?
810026 Eeyup.
810005 Discord? A little help? Discord!
810000 [beat]
810005 [sighs]
810026 [whispering]
810005 Yeah? Oh! Good idea! [clears throat] Captain Wuzz! Are you prepared to enter the world of Ogres & Oubliettes?
810000 [poof!]
8100db Huzzah, fellow adventurers! Shall we storm the ramparts of Squizard's castle to reclaim Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility?
810000 [beat]
8100db You did summon me for a rousing Guys' Night of Ogres & Oubliettes, did you not?
810005 Uh, sort of. But do you think you could magically hurry up this pie real quick first?
8100db You seem to be mixing up [poof!] the Lord of Chaos [poof!] with a second-rate clown magician for hire.
810026 Eee... wait!
810005 This needs to go in the mail today, or it'll never get to Sugar Belle in time for Hearts and Hooves Day!
810026 [embarrassed giggling]
8100db Please. Can't you see that that holiday is a commercialized ruse pushed on you by the greeting card industry?
810026 [clears throat irritably]
8100db Fine. You owe me for this. [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [poof!]
8100db Keep your eye on the pie. [à la Doug Henning] It's magic time!
810000 [poof!]
810000 [theme song]
8100db [sniffing] This smells... uh... palatable.
810005 Well, pies really are Sugar Belle's thing. But I think that makes this all the more special. It shows you're interested in what she cares about.
810026 Eeyup!
810005 And he's planning a big romantic Hearts and Hooves dinner. It was my idea to bake the invitation inside.
8100db [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
8100db [reading] "Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me in my barn at sunset for a surprise."
810005 Pretty clever, huh?
810026 Eeyup. [chuckling]
8100db Ugh. [snaps fingers]
810000 [paper wrapping]
810005 Awww. "Sugar Belle". See?
8100db Well, you two certainly have bought into this romance nonsense hook, line, and sinker.
810005 For a formerly friendless immortal despot, you're pretty cynical.
8100db I'm a realist. And love, like all things warm and fuzzy, isn't real.
810005 Aw, come on. You act tough, but deep down, you're a softie. I mean, you don't have tea with Fluttershy every weekend because you like tea.
8100db But I do like tea! Every tea! All the teas! Chamomile, Earl Grey, green, white, yellow, mate, lemon, ginger, chai, spearmint, peppermint, hibiscus... [inhale] ...cinnamon, pumpkin spice.
810026 [groans]
810000 [door opens]
810005 Tell you what. While Big Mac mails his incredibly romantic gesture, I'll show you the splendors of Hearts and Hooves Day in Ponyville. I bet I can prove you believe in love.
8100db Fine. Call it a gentleman's wager. Loser mows my lawn for eternity.
810005 Is it, like, a riding mower or...?
8100db Tweezers!
810005 [gulps]
810000 [montage music]
81000a Hear ye, hear ye! This special Hearts and Hooves Day meetin' of the Cutie Mark Crusaders is now in session! First order of business – helpin' my big brother decorate the barn for his big date with Sugar Belle tonight, and... Hello?
810066 It seems like everypony's got somepony special but us.
810065 When's it gonna be our turn?
810000 [knocking on door]
810105 Huh?
810000 [door opens]
81000a Huh?
810065 [gasps] Who's it from?
81000a Can't tell. It's all smudged, but it looks like it's addressed to... "Belle"? Hmmm...
810066 [gasps] "Sweetie Belle"!
810000 [paper tearing]
810066 Somepony certainly went through a lot of trouble for me! On Hearts and Hooves Day!
810065 [gasps] You don't think...
810066 Could it be...?
81000a Hang on a minute. Mysterious package, smudged address, no idea who it's from... Hm. I know what this is. You've got a secret admirer!
810080 [cheering and laughing]
810005 [sighs] Another Hearts and Hooves Day. Love is in the air, Discord. Look at all these happy couples.
8100db How can they be happy if they aren't playing Ogres & Oubliettes?
810005 As a great dragon poet once wrote to his beloved, "I love you with the utmost clarity. I love you, dear. My sweet, sweet Rarity—" Are you even listening?!
8100db Of course. "Love is... something-something, and Discord is great." I don't know. Can we play O&O now?
810005 Sure, after you admit you believe in love and... Sugar Belle!
810000 [bushes rustle]
810005 Big Mac's girlfriend. What's she doing in town so early?
81002a Well, Sugar Belle, I'm sure Big Mac won't be expecting it.
810005 [gasps] She's planning her own romantic surprise for Big Mac? What if she goes to Sweet Apple Acres before Big Mac's ready with his surprise? We've gotta warn him!
8100db [scoffs, snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810026 [singing] ...ffle, cookin' a souffle...
810000 [poof!]
810005 Aah!
810000 [thud]
810026 Whoa!
810005 [slurring] Mig Bac... Mig Bac...! [groans] I mean, Big Mac! We just saw Sugar Belle! She's at Sugarcube Corner! But I think she's on her way over here now! You gotta keep her away from here until the barn's finished!
810026 [gasps] Eeyup!
810005 I wonder what she has planned for him.
8100db [chuckles] We don't have to wonder. [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [poof!]
810005 Aah!
810000 [bushes rustle]
810005 Ugh! Will you warn me next time you do that?
810000 [door opens]
810000 [clop, clop, clop]
81002a Just be honest with him. I'm sure Big Mac will... [continues indistinctly]
810005 Ohhhh. She hasn't seen him yet. Take note, Discord. This is what love is all about.
810000 [poof!]
8100db "Spike – Love is about spying in the bushes."
810005 Make fun of me all you want. But look at Big Mac's face and tell me you don't believe in love.
810000 [romantic music]
8100db [scoffs]
81027f I hope he'll be okay without me.
810000 [screech!]
810026 [panicked noises]
810000 [bushes rustle]
810005 Oh. Hey. We're just... not spying—
810026 Hush!
81027f I mean, he has been on his own before. So he'll be fine, right? [sighs] How should I tell Big Mac tonight? "You won't need to come visit me in my village anymore"? "We need to talk."
81002a Just be honest with him.
81027f You're right. Okay! "We're finished."
810026 [gasps]
810000 [heart beating]
810000 [crack]
810000 [thud]
8100db You're right. She did surprise him.
810005 Ugh.
810026 [wailing loudly, gulping]
810005 Okay. Things seem bad. Maybe they're really not. Maybe "we're finished" was about the day. Ponies say that, right? Like-like, "Hey, remember yesterday? That's finished, 'cause it's today!"
810000 [beat]
810005 Maybe not that. Oh, I know! Maybe Sugar Belle has a wacky cousin who's never been on his own, and she has to leave him in charge of her shop while she apprentices with Mrs Cake, who does that, like, two days a week. N-No, no, three. That's why she won't need you to come to her village anymore, because... she'll already be here!
810000 [beat]
810005 Nah. I don't even buy that one.
810026 [continues wailing, gulping] She takes pie-bakin' seriously! Why'd I even try?! I bet she thought I... I was makin' fun of her! [continues wailing]
810000 [poof!]
8100db Oh, I hate seeing you like this, Big Mac. And over a girl, no less. I'm calling an emergency Guys' Night [poof!] right now to cheer you up.
810026 [blows nose]
8100db Besides, we can't have you ruining any more of my thousand-year-old monogrammed handkerchiefs. These are silk, you know. [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [poof!]
8100db Class is now in session.
810000 [poof!]
8100db Lesson one – nothing can break your heart if you only love yourself. You've got to show everypony that you're too cool to be bothered with so-called love. Observe.
810000 [poof!]
8100db This is how cool guys lean against things. When you see a guy leaning against a thing looking this cool, you think, "Wow! That guy doesn't have a care in Equestria. Not a guy who leans on things that cool."
810005 I don't think leaning's gonna help. Am I doing it right? Whoa!
810000 [thud]
810026 [sighs]
810005 We're not like you, Discord. We can't put on a front and pretend not to love. It's impossible.
8100db Lesson two – plenty of ponies in the pasture. Right, Big Mac? I know just the gal to make you forget all about Sugar Belle.
810026 You... said... her... [wailing] naaaaaaame!
8100db Oy vey... [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [ponies chattering]
81000a Okay. We finished decoratin' the barn for Big Mac, which means we got the rest of the day to ourselves. There's a whole town of possible admirers out there and only three of us. But together, we're gonna get to the bottom of this! Ready? Break! Excuse me! Pipsqueak? Mind answerin' a few questions? No? Late for somethin'? Are you Sweetie Belle's secret admirer?!
810065 [to Button Mash] Excuse me! I'm doing a research survey about sending pie in the mail anonymously. Would you say you're pro-that or anti-that?
810066 [to Snips and Snails] Happy Hearts and Hooves Day! Did you boys happen to send any packages to me recently? It's okay to say no! I won't be offended! [whispering] Please say no, please say no, please say no.
810000 [poof!]
8100db [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
8100db Sir McBigguns, meet Skellinore. She's a Level 18 Bone Warrior in Squizard's mage army, but only to pay off skeleton student loan debts. Get to know each other, why don't you? [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810005 Wow. You're really going all out to cheer up Big Mac. I'm impressed.
8100db Yes, yes, I'm amazing. Anyway, since we're in the neighborhood, care for a quick game of Ogres & Oubliettes? Like I've been wanting to play all week?!
810005 I take it back.
8100db I'm helping our friend first and foremost. See for yourself.
810005 I think he's showing her a picture of Sugar Belle.
8100db What?
810005 And now he's crying.
8100db No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no. No, he's not. Let me see that.
810005 Don't touch it! I'm looking!
8100db Give me that!
810005 Cut it out! Discord, quit it!
810000 [poof!]
810026 She used to do this thing where her-her nose would wrinkle when she laughed. Right there, in that hole where your nose used to be. I never told her how much I loved wrinkle-nose cutie-face... [wailing] and now I never will!
8100db Ugh. [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [thud]
810026 [crying]
810005 Okay. I think we've had enough of the aloof master of chaos remedies for a broken heart. You know what I do when I have a problem too big to solve? I hide from it! When she can't find you, she'll realize how much she misses you. Plus, if she can't find you, she can't break up with you.
810026 Eeyup. Hup!
810005 Ha!
8100db [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [door opens]
810065 [sighs] I don't get it. We asked every stallion in Ponyville.
81000a [groans] There's gotta be somepony we're missin'. Somepony obvious. Somepony right in front of our noses.
810066 Oh, well. At least the barn's looking great for Big Mac's date.
810000 [poof!]
8100db Too bad there won't be a date.
810066 Sugar Belle is so lucky to have a non-secret admirer like Big Mac.
8100db Well, she certainly doesn't seem to have appreciated it.
81000a I bet she's gonna take one look at this barn and say, "What did I ever do to deserve this?"
8100db [whispering] Yes, what did she do to deserve this?
810026 She broke my heart.
8100db Well, not yet, technically. In fact, she can't break your heart if you break hers first.
810026 [angrily] Eeyup!
81027f Thanks for the tour of Ponyville, Mrs Cake.
81002a Oh, my pleasure.
81027f I'm off to surprise Big Mac with the news. Imagine the look on his face when I tell him, "We need to talk."
81002a Oh, dear me, no! I told you, don't say it that way or he'll think you're breaking up with him.
81027f Break up with him? Never! Why, without my favorite delivery pony, I couldn't imagine being happy ever again. He knows that.
81002a Good! Save your mix-up for cake batter – that's what I always say! [chuckles]
81027f He's a good listener, that pony. I promise you, no mix-ups.
810000 [poof!]
81027f Ah! Big Mac!
810026 Sugar Belle... we need to talk.
810026 I know why you're here.
81027f You do?
810026 But I have somethin' to tell you first.
81027f Oh, can I go first? I'm gonna be—
810026 Stop.
81027f Oh. Why don't we tell each other on three? One—
810026 It's over!
81027f What's over?
810026 You and me. It's over.
81027f Ah... What?
810026 We're breakin' up!
81027f I... don't understand. Why are you breaking up with me? And why are you leaning like that?
810026 I... don't know!
81027f Big Mac, please. Talk to me.
810026 I... You... [loud groan] This is why I don't like talkin'! Words can hurt! Words hurt! Goodbye, Sugar Belle!
810000 [door slams]
81027f [crying]
810000 [sad montage music]
810000 [door opens]
81000a Big Mac! Oh, thank goodness! You gotta help us with this.
810000 [rustling]
810005 Ugh. Dude, how long have you been not hiding?
810000 [poof!]
8100db Oh. I should probably have said something.
810026 Y'all should go.
810005 Did ya...? Did she...? Are ya...?
81000a Big Mac, what's goin' on? Where's Sugar Belle?
810026 Just go!
810066 But we worked so hard on this chart. I think we've almost cracked it. If you could just—
810026 Not right now!
810066 But I can't stand having a secret admirer who's too scared to tell me who he is!
810026 Maybe he doesn't like talkin'!
810066 But that doesn't make any sense!
810026 Maybe he used to talk too much, and it only ever got him into trouble!
810005 [sighs] What if you're right, Discord? What if love isn't real at all?
810000 [ding!]
810000 [poof!]
810026 I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle. I'm just mad, and I'm takin' it out on you.
810066 That's okay. I bet it felt good to get it out though.
810026 Actually, it did. Tellin' you how I felt just then... I gotta go!
810005 Big Mac! Where are ya goin'?
810026 I gotta talk to Sugar Belle!
810005 Discord, you gotta use your magic and...! Guess you have better things to do. Big Mac's gonna need a miracle.
81027f [sighs]
810000 [clatter]
81027f Oh. All the rotten luck...
810000 [splash]
810026 Caught ya just in time! We both know I don't like to say much, but I'm gonna say somethin' now. [sighs] Even though I'm hurtin', I wouldn't trade this feelin' for anythin'. Because it'd mean givin' up the good times we had, too. I only broke up with you because you were gonna break up with me. I respect your decision, and you should know you'll always be in my heart.
81027f I didn't want to break up with you.
810026 But... you said you didn't need me to visit anymore. You said I'm gonna be on my own. I-I heard you said "we're finished" when I was hidin' in the bushes.
810000 [beat]
810026 That sounds worse than it is.
81027f Oh, Big Mac! I was talking about my cousin! I have this wacky cousin who's never been on his own, but I have to let him run my shop on weekends. Which is why you won't be delivering to my village anymore because I'll already be here apprenticing with Mrs Cake, who does that two days a week. No, three.
810026 Wait 'til I tell Spike!
81027f I'd never break up with you! I suppose there's a lesson here somewhere about communication, talking instead of assuming, or eavesdropping is wrong. Wouldn't you say?
810026 Eeeeyup!
81027f [giggles, snorts]
810026 Hee-hee. Wrinkle-nose cutie-face. [kisses] You must've been awful confused at my breakin' up with you after you got my pie.
81027f What pie?
810026 You didn't get the pie I sent?
81027f Mm-mm.
810026 Or the invitation?
81027f Uh-uh.
810026 Well, in that case... allow me to escort you to a Hearts and Hooves Day surprise!
81027f [giggles, snorts]
810000 [birds chirping]
810066 [sighs]
81000a Mind if we join ya?
810066 [chomp] [reading] "Happy Hearts and Hooves Day, Sugar Belle. Meet me—"
810080 Sugar Belle?!
810065 You have got to be pulling our hooves!
810066 It was all a mix-up?!
810080 [laughing]
810066 Oh, it's funny. I've been sitting here feeling sorry for myself for not having a special pony on Hearts and Hooves Day. But remembering all the fun we had, I think I have two special ponies – my two best friends.
81007f Awwwww...
810005 [sighs] And so ends another Hearts and Hooves Day. Despite a bumpy start... and middle... and ending... lot of bumps today... love was in the air.
8100db So was confusion, apparently, and a fair number of assumptions.
810005 But you have to admit, after seeing everything Big Mac went through, love is a hundred percent real.
8100db [humming]
810005 Seriously?! Discord, come on! I can't believe you!
8100db Who do you think broke Sugar Belle's wagon wheel?
810000 [thud]
8100db Ta-da! Happy Hearts and Hooves Day!
810005 You old softie. [laughs] I knew you had a heart.
8100db Speaking of how great I am, are you busy for the rest of the night? [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
8100db Calico's Ring of Imperceptibility isn't going to reclaim itself, you know.
810005 Ogres & Oubliettes? I thought you'd never ask! Oh, and... just wondering. No biggie, but... is Skellinore gonna be there?
8100db Spike, she's an imaginary one-dimensional paper cutout skeleton.
810005 Well, nopony's perfect.
8100db [snaps fingers]
810000 [poof!]
810000 [credits]
81100d I do appreciate you showing me the way to the phoenix nests, Spike.
811005 Anything for you, Rarity. Besides, I've been meaning to visit Peewee.
81100d He really was an excellent pet. I can't imagine why you set him free.
811005 Phoenixes aren't meant to be domesticated. Even in the wild, they like to keep to themselves.
81100d Well, they are beautiful. A few of their feathers will add just the right splash of color to my latest— Spike! What are you doing?
811005 Uh, nothing!
81100d Is there something wrong with your face?
811005 [sighs] It's a stone scale. It isn't magical or anything like the call of the Dragon Lord. It's just... red. And itchy. [groans] And embarrassing.
811000 [throbbing]
81100d Ooh, precious pants, that does look uncomfortable. But even I get the odd blemish from time to time. It's nothing to be embarrassed by. You could pay Zecora a visit. She makes a cream that works wonders. Just don't get the shampoo.
811005 There's Peewee's parents! But I don't see Peewee.
81100d Oh, maybe he moved out. Everypony has to leave the nest at some point.
811000 [fluttering]
811005 Peewee!
811481 [squawks]
811000 [sizzle]
811005 Ouch! [scratching]
81100d Perhaps you should pay Zecora a visit sooner rather than later.
811005 [sighs] I don't want anypony else to see this. Besides, I'm sure it'll clear up after a good night's sleep.
811005 [snoring]
811000 [door opens]
811003 I can't believe you're still asleep!
811005 [groans] Just five more minutes... [continues snoring]
811003 It's nearly noon, and you promised to help me with my lecture for class today!
811005 Noon? Whoa! I slept like a rock! Which reminds me – all that sleep probably cleared up my stone scale!
811003 [gasps] Um, on second thought... [chuckles nervously] You can go back to sleep if you want.
811005 [screams]
811000 [theme song]
811000 [curtains drawing]
811003 Spike, what are you doing?
811005 Hiding from my hideous face!
811003 I'm sure it feels terrible, but it's just a breakout. It's not the end of the world.
811005 That's easy for you to say. Your face isn't covered in itchy red spots! [scratching]
811003 I used to get terrible breakouts any time I had a final exam with Celestia. Who probably never had a blemish her whole life.
811005 Well, I'm not in magic school.
811003 No, but these things can be stress-related. And you did spend yesterday with Rarity.
811005 [chuckles nervously] What could possibly be stressful about that?
811003 [groans] You could try Zecora. She makes a cream that—
811005 Works wonders. I've heard. But I'm not leaving the castle until my face is back to its adorable self. [winces]
811003 Fine. But you're still gonna help me practice my lecture.
811005 [groans]
811003 [clears throat] The element of generosity and its importance in relation to the other Elements of Harmony—
811005 [gags, breathes fire]
811003 [gasps] My lecture!
811005 I don't know what happened! I just had a sudden case of— [gags]
811000 [teleportation zap]
811005 [breathes fire]
811000 [teleportation zap]
811000 [fire extinguisher spraying]
811005 ...indigestion. I'm so sorry!
811003 [sighs] It's okay. I'm sure I can rewrite the lecture from my notes. I have a lot.
811005 I can help you with—
811003 Maybe you should leave the castle after all. And go somewhere less... flammable?
811005 [sighs]
811000 [ponies chattering]
811005 Hey there, not handsome.
81100d [singsongy] Oh, Spike! My, what a fetching ensemble you put together. Very noir-esque. [giggles] I believe Shadow Spade herself would approve.
811005 Uh, thanks.
81100d But I wonder if you wouldn't mind taking it off.
811005 What? Oh, I, uh... I... [muttering lowly]
81100d Sorry, you'll have to speak up. My ears are a little bit clogged or something. It's just that I absolutely must have a model for my phoenix feather dress, and nopony else is available.
811005 Sorry, Rarity, but I... I am super busy all day giving... tours of the school!
811007 Really? I thought I was giving tours today. Guess not. Free day! Whee! Woo-hoo!
811005 Classrooms are that way. [groans] Dorms are that way. [groans] Twilight's office is up there. This is a fountain.
811482 [panting] Could you slow down a bit? We've come a long way to see the school, and I don't wanna miss anything.
811005 Oh. Um, yeah. [wincing, scratching] Sorry.
811482 I-Is something wrong?
811005 What? Why? No! [scratching]
811482 Uh, do all the dragons at this school suffer from scale issues?
811005 [low voice] I don't know.
811482 What?
811005 [low voice, straining] I don't... know!
811482 I-I'm sorry, did-did you say "firework show"?
811005 [low voice] I said... [loudly, echoing] I don't know! [gasps]
811005 [echoing] This is the school library! It's one of the most serene spots on campus, where students can spend time in quiet reflection or study! What?!
811186 Could you please stop shouting? We're trying to do our homework, and it's kind of distracting.
811005 [loud voice] Was I shouting?!
811000 [affirmative muttering]
811005 [clears throat, normal volume] I have no idea what you're talking— Ulp! [belches, breathes fire]
811000 [thud]
811005 [gasps and groans]
811005 [breathing fire]
811000 [door opens]
811186 If you're trying to hide, you need to do a better job. All I had to do was follow the smoke.
811000 [door closes]
811005 [low voice, straining] Leave me alone!
811186 What?
811005 [low voice, straining] Leave! Me! Alone!
811186 I can't under... Was that "sleeves made of foam"?
811005 [low voice] I said, leave [normal voice] me alone! [belches, breathes fire, sighs]
811186 [laughs] Wow! I have seen some pretty bad molts in my time, but yours takes the cake!
811005 Molts?
811186 The molt? Super painful stone scales, fire burps, uncontrollable volume shifts? It's all part of growing up dragon. Congrats!
811000 [smack!]
811005 [groans and winces]
811186 Oh. Sorry.
811005 No-no-no-no-no. The last time I grew up, I turned into a giant greedy monster.
811186 Greed-induced bigness. That's totally different. The molt is completely normal. Every dragon goes through it. Pretty soon, you'll leave and strike out on your own.
811005 Why would I do that?
811186 Have you been living with ponies your whole life?
811005 Uh-huh.
811186 Oh. Well, in the Dragon Lands, a molter's loved ones kicks them out at the first stone scale.
811005 What? Why?
811186 I think it's biological. We call it the "molt effect". I haven't even told you about the smell.
811005 Smell? [sniffs] Ugh!
811186 Yeah. I mean, I love my brother and all, but one whiff, and I was all "See ya!" [sniffs] Speaking of which...
811005 Wait! Does the molt effect happen to ponies too? [gasps] Twilight already asked me to leave the castle today. If she kicks me out, where am I gonna live? I'm too young to grow up!
811186 I'm sure you'll find a nice...
811000 [thud]
811186 ...hoard of gems to guard or a village to terrorize. Oh, now that dragons and ponies are friends, I guess that's off the table.
811005 So no creature's gonna wanna be around me?
811186 Oh, I didn't say that. That molt stench is a magnet for predators. Tatzlwurms, hydras, rocs...
811005 Dragons are scared of rocks?
811186 R-O-C-S. Rocs? Humongous birds of prey that can snack on a molting dragon like candy!
811005 [low voice] So Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?
811186 Seriously, I heard none of that.
811005 [loud voice] Twilight's kicking me out, and the only creatures who don't find me disgusting want to eat me?!
811186 Congrats!
811000 [door opens]
811007 [shouting] Hey! Is this the shouting closet?! Because I've got a free day, and I'm totally up for some shouting! [sniffs] [normal voice] Also, where's that brussel-sprouts-covered-in-cotton-candy smell coming from? Because it is really interesting.
811005 I didn't know where else to go. I can't take the chance that Twilight will kick me out. You aren't feeling any molt effects, are you?
811047 [nose plugged] When it comes to breakouts, I've seen all circumstances. But as with the molt smell... let's not take any chances.
811005 [scratches, sighs] Is there anything you can do to cure me?
811047 The ailments you have aren't something to cure. The molt's a condition that dragons endure.
811005 [scratches] But if anypony sees or smells me right now, they'll be so grossed out, they'll avoid me forever!
811047 Perhaps we can lessen this strange molt effect. The smell is the most likely cause, I suspect.
811005 [low voice] It's all so embarrassing.
811047 I know you are speaking, but I can't hear a thing. Are you talking about teaching asparagus to sing?
811005 [low voice] I said it's [loud voice] embarrassing!
811047 If the goal is to not have your friends all depart, perhaps your volume is where we should start.
811000 [stomach rumbling]
811005 Oh, no. [gags, belches, breathes fire, sighs]
81100d Zecora! Hello? Are you there?
811005 [loud voice] I can't let Rarity see me like this! Please don't let her know I'm here!
811000 [knocking on door]
811000 [door opens]
81100d [loudly] Oh, dear! I'm talking even louder than I thought, aren't I?!
811047 I have volume concerns today by the scores. But it seems that I'm ready to help you with yours.
81100d [loudly] Eh, I-I'm sorry?! I can't seem to hear anything! I was hoping you could help! I have no idea what happened! One minute, I was sewing phoenix feathers onto a dress, and the next I couldn't hear my own voice!
811047 Ah, the feathers of that bird can affect ponies' ears. It's a magic ailment I've treated for years.
81100d [loudly] I only know you're talking 'cause your mouth is going up and down. [sighs, sniffs, coughs] [normal volume] Oh, goodness! I hope that incredibly pungent odor belongs to some sort of magical curative. [loudly] I hope you're not busy, but I must have my hearing back! It turns out that I talk to myself while I sew, and without that conversation, I simply can't think!
811047 It's a simple cure, and the directions are clear. Just one or two drops in each of your ears.
81100d [sighs, normal volume] Oh, thank you. You're an ear saver. [loudly] Oh, and while I am here, do you have any blemish cream?! Spike is having some scale issues!
811005 [loud voice] You have no idea!
81100d [gasps, normal voice] I think I heard something! [loudly] Your cure is working already!
811047 The cream that you want is just over here. It's a popular potion for all creatures this year.
81100d [sighs, normal voice] Thank you, Zecora.
811000 [window creaks]
811000 [door opens]
81100d [loudly] I don't mean to be rude, but I do think your hut could use an airing out!
811047 Rarity's gone. There's no need to hide. [sniffs, groans] Though I wonder if we should continue outside. Can't treat your symptoms down there on the ground. It's safe to come out. There's no ponies around.
811005 I'm not hiding from ponies. I'm hiding from that!
811000 [roc screeches]
811000 [roc screeches]
811005 Did I forget to mention the molt smell attracts predators?
811047 That's something that would've been quite nice to know! But it's not worth discussing right now! We should go!
811000 [roc screeching]
811005 It's only after me! I'll lead it away while you get help! This way, birdy-bird! Molting dragon over here! [grunting and huffing]
811000 [leaves rustling]
811005 Okay, maybe this wasn't a good plan.
811047 You can't hide in a tree! You have to come down! We stand a much better chance on the ground! [screams]
811005 Zecora! Bring her back! [groans, scratches]
811000 [roc screeches]
811005 [panting]
811000 [thud]
81100d Oh, Spike. What are you doing here?
811005 Rarity! You have to get out of here! There's a giant roc trying to eat me! It's got Zecora!
81100d Yes, what? [loudly] I was just at Zecora's, but I'm heading back! I can't read these instructions! Does this say "two drops once a day" or "one drop twice a day"?!
811005 Rarity, there's no time! We have to get help!
81100d [loudly] Yes, my ears are completely clogged! Why, Spike! Your stone scales look worse! Oh, here! I picked up just the thing. Ah—
811000 [roc screeches]
81100d [screams]
811047 Oh, I wish you'd escaped either claw of this bird! But the both of us trapped in the same one's absurd!
81100d [loudly] What?!
811005 [groans] Let my ponies go!
811000 [thudding]
811005 Whoa! [breathes fire]
811000 [roc screeches]
811005 [screams, groaning]
811000 [grinding sounds]
811005 [sighs, scratches, wailing groans]
811003 Spike, what are you doing?
811005 If my stone scales didn't itch so much and we weren't in immediate danger, this would be [chuckles] really embarrassing!
811003 Danger?
811000 [roc screeching]
811000 [teleportation zaps]
811003 Well, I was headed to Zecora's to get some cream for your scales. I had no idea you were—
811005 [groans] About to be eaten by a giant predator attracted to my molt smell?! [scratches]
811003 Molt smell?
811000 [roc screeches]
81100d [high-pitched] Twilight!
811005 Whoa!
811003 Was that Rarity?
811005 And Zecora! I tried to save them, but it's all I can do to stop scratching long enough to dive out of the way when that bird attacks!
811000 [magic zaps]
81100d [loudly] This isn't the first time I've been in the clutches of a horrible giant creature, but it doesn't get any easier! [cries]
811000 [magic zaps]
811005 [gasps, sighs] Finally! I didn't think that itching would ever stop!
811000 [cracking sounds]
811005 What's happening?! I... I can't move!
811000 [magic zaps]
811000 [cracking sounds]
811005 What just... happened? Did I just sprout wings? I just sprouted wings!
811000 [magic zaps]
811000 [roc screeches]
811005 [gasps] I've gotta help them! W-Whoa! Whooaaa! [yelping]
811000 [thuds]
811000 [magic zaps]
811005 Whoops.
811003 Spike?! How did you get wings?!
811005 I don't know! But they're pretty aweso– Whoa!
811000 [roc screeches]
811003 Do you think you can fly up and distract him while I work on freeing Zecora and Rarity?
811005 Hey, giant chicken! If you like dragons so much, come and get me!
811000 [beak snapping]
811005 Greetings.
811000 [beak snaps]
811000 [stomach rumbling]
811005 [breathes fire]
81100d [screams]
811003 Spike!
811047 I know that the molt produced surprising things. But I'm glad that the last was a new pair of wings!
81100d [loudly] Yes! And also, I'm glad you've got wings!
811003 This is amazing! I didn't know if you'd ever get wings. I'm so happy for you. Does it have something to do with this molt you were talking about?
811005 [sighs] It's what's been going on with me. The breakout, the fire burps. The molt is when dragons get older and start to change. I wish I could stop it, but I can't. I-I should go.
811003 Go? What are you talking about?
811005 In the Dragon Lands, families make molters leave home. It's called the molt effect.
811003 Well, this isn't the Dragon Lands, and molt effect or no, I don't want you going anywhere.
811005 But I'm growing up. What if something even worse happens?
811003 You're supposed to grow up, but you'll always be you. And whatever happens, we'll get through it together.
811005 Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Look at me! Let's go home!
811003 Uh, I don't need to carry you anymore, do I? You have wings.
811005 They are new, and I don't want to overdo it.
811003 [groans]
81100d I can't believe you thought any of us would send you away because of some silly molt effect. [sighs] Even if the symptoms were slightly unsettling. And let's face it, the odor wasn't pleasant. Nopony would stop caring for you just because you were getting older. Everypony goes through changes, but sometimes change can be wonderful. Like being able to model for any length of dress! [giggles] Uh, a bit higher, darling, please?
811005 I'm glad to help, Rarity. But don't you think there's wonderful things about flying that don't involve dresses?
81100d Of course, darling. Flying will also be beneficial for you to help me with gowns, frocks, robes, shifts, skirts, minis, maxis... [fades out]
811005 [sighs]
811000 [credits]
81225f [tweeting]
812000 [leaves rustling]
812065 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
81200a [grunting]
812065 Almost... there...
81200a Ah! I can't wait! Twilight's school is supposed to be amazin' inside!
812066 [whispering] Rarity says there's never been a school like it!
812065 [grunting] I heard the students get to do tons of awesome stuff!
81200a Do ya see anything yet?
812065 Uh, yeah. It looks like a broom! And a dustpan and some buckets.
812066 That sounds like a closet.
81200a Try another window.
812080 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
812065 Whoa...
812007 Whooooo's ready for cupcakes?!
812000 [music]
812184 [slurps]
812007 Oh, they're not for you, silly. They're for sharing! First, say something nice like this. Ocellus, you are a great listener! Now you get to keep one cupcake and share one with another creature.
812189 Yona, you're really strong!
812187 [chomps]
812000 [crashes]
812007 Ugh!
812065 [gasps]
812080 Whoa!
812000 [thud]
812080 [oohing and ahhing]
81200e All right, students! It's time to meet some new friends!
812183 [excited chatter]
812080 [oohing and ahhing]
812008 Incomin'! [grunts]
812183 [laughter]
812008 That's friendship in action, y'all!
812183 [excited chatter]
812066 Wow! And I thought our school was fun!
812065 Yeah! Miss Cheerilee never lets us play buckball in class. I know. I've tried.
81200a Hey! Why don't we go here instead? It's still school, right?
812080 [cheering] Great idea!
81200a [sighs] What could be better than learnin' friendship with your best friends?
812007 Learning friendship with your best friends... and cake! [munches]
812080 [giggling]
812000 [theme song]
812000 [indistinct chatter]
812003 [clears throat] Good morning, class. Today, we're going to learn about friendship through the ages. Spike, slide one, please.
812000 [slide projector turns on]
812003 Back in the days of Chancellor Puddinghead... Uh, Spike?
812005 Huh? Sorry, Twilight. Still getting used to my new wings. They're pretty great, huh?
812003 Yes, Spike. As I was saying... Huh? What are you three doing here?
81200a We wanna go to your school!
812003 But why?
812066 We wanna learn friendship!
812065 And play buckball!
812003 I see. Why don't you three come with me? Spike, you're in charge.
812005 Yes!
81227c Hi, Twilight! Looks like you could use a guidance counselor's help! Hint, hint.
812003 No, thanks, Starlight. I've got this.
81227c [sadly] Great. Well, I'll just... go dust my office for the seventieth time.
812003 [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... you can't be my students.
812066 Why not?
812065 Isn't this place for everycreature?
812003 Yes, but we teach friendship lessons here. You already know all about helping ponies in need and being there for each other.
812066 Can't you just give us a chance?
812080 Pleeeeeeeeeeeaaaase?
812003 You need Cheerilee's classes, not mine. Hurry up. You don't want late marks on your permanent record.
812000 [door opens]
812183 O dragon! My dragon!
812003 Spike?! What did you do?
812005 [laughs nervously]
812000 [door closes]
812065 [sighs] Well, I'm not giving up! I know we can prove we belong in this school!
812066 Yeah! Um... how?
81200a By showin' Twilight we've still got lots to learn about friendship. And I know just where to start.
812000 [squish]
812008 [grunts] What in tarnation? Apple Bloom! You know better than to leave our good tools out like that! And aren't you supposed to be on harvest duty right now?
81200a Eh, it's not like the apples are goin' anywhere.
812008 [stammering] What's gotten into you? Those chores are your responsibility! Farm work is family work!
81200a Sorry, Applejack. Maybe if I went to Twilight's school, I'd learn to be better at helpin' the family.
812008 Ahhh. So that's what this is all about. Well, if it's learnin' you want, I'd be happy to give you a private lesson right now... [angrily] Startin' with cleanin' up all this equipment!
81200a Hmph!
812066 Please can I go to Twilight's school?!
81200d [screams, sighs, sighs again]
812066 Please? Please?!
81200d I'm going to call you "Repeatie Belle"! We've been through this! Please let me concentrate! [sighs]
812066 How 'bout now?
81200c So there I was, leading the Wonderbolt formation into a super dangerous Sundown Spiral, when suddenly... [imitates whooshing] There was a huge storm cloud in our way!
812483 What happened?
81200c My genius happened! I changed the routine on the fly! And because my crew are such tight friends, they followed me!
812484 [gasps] What did you do?!
81200c Only the coolest thing ever! I flew up and—
812065 Did a super-amazing half-twist into a backflip sonic rainboom?!
81200c Hey! I never told that story to my students before. Scootaloo!
812065 [laughs nervously] Never met her. [sighs]
812000 [ponies chattering]
812066 They're coming! Get ready!
812000 [scooting]
812000 [whirrs]
812065 Look out!
81200a [stiltedly] Look out! Whoa!
812065 [grunts]
812000 [thudding]
812065 [stiltedly] Hey! Watch where you are going!
81200a [stiltedly] I was watching! Watching you drive like a crazy pony!
812065 [stiltedly] Well, maybe if you did not drop apples all over the street, I would not have to!
81200e Ooh. I've never seen Apple Bloom and Scootaloo argue like this.
812007 Yeah. They usually go together like candy canes and stripes.
812066 Whoa! Oof!
81200a [stiltedly] My apples? This is all your fault, Scootaloo!
812065 [stiltedly] Hey, Sweetie Belle is the clumsy one!
812066 [stiltedly] I'm not talking to either one of you ever again!
81200e Goodness. They seem really upset.
812007 It's almost like they forgot they're friends.
812065 [quietly] I think it's working!
812066 [stiltedly] You are so careless! [quietly] Good plan, Apple Bloom!
81200a [stiltedly] Careless? I will show you who is the one who is careless! [quietly] And great acting, Sweetie Belle!
812065 [out loud] We're an awesome team!
81200a All right!
812007 Yay!
81200a Oops.
812007 You're friends again! I knew you would be! Candy cane stripes forever!
812000 [party cannon squeak]
812080 [sighs]
812065 Now they'll never let us into Twilight's school.
81200a Okay, we've tried shirkin' chores, pesterin', disguises, fightin'.
812066 Hmmm... We need to do something new. Something unexpected.
812000 [muffled crying]
81200a Great idea, Scootaloo! We haven't tried cryin' yet.
812066 Yeah! It always works for Rarity.
812065 I wasn't crying. I think it's coming from outside.
812485 [crying]
812066 Aww. She looks so sad. We better go see what's wrong.
812485 [continues crying]
81200a Hey. Are you okay?
812485 Oh. Thank you for asking. But no. I'm having real trouble with... [sniffling] ...the School of Friendship.
812065 Twilight won't let you go either, huh?
812485 Oh, no, it's not that. I'm in her class, but... [sniffling] ...it's too hard! [crying]
812066 Really?
812485 I just moved here to go to school, but everything's so new and different. I don't know anypony.
81200a Well, now you do. I'm Apple Bloom. This is Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo. We're the Cutie Mark Crusaders.
812485 [sniffs] I'm Cozy Glow. It's very nice to meet you, but I don't know if I'll stay long. I'll probably flunk out. I'm having so much trouble with my friendship lessons.
812080 [gasps]
812066 We can help with those!
812065 We know all about friendship!
81200a And studyin' with you would be almost as good as bein' in class!
812485 But why would you help me? What's in it for you?
812066 That's how friendship works. When you give from your heart, you don't expect anything back.
812485 Well, golly, if you really mean it...
812080 Uh-huh!
812485 I could use some help with my homework. I have to do something nice for each of these ponies. But I don't know anything about them. And it's so hard to talk to ponies you've never met.
81200a Well, you're in luck, 'cause we know all of those ponies!
812065 Get ready for a friendship A-plus!
812000 [zoom!]
812065 That's Bon Bon. If you wanna do something nice for her, first you gotta figure out what she needs.
812485 Well, how am I supposed to do that?
812065 Just pay attention. Friendship is about listening to others.
812027 Ow. Ow.
812065 Uh-oh. That cactus keeps pricking her every step she takes. Hmm, if only there was something to protect her from those spines.
812027 [winces]
812485 It looks like you need help carrying your cactus, so here's a safe way to take it home. [laughs nervously]
812027 Thank you! That's so thoughtful.
812485 I did it!
812065 Good job! But, uh, next time, maybe don't give away my helmet.
812485 Oopsie.
812066 Green, purple, yellow. And one more purple. Whew. Sorting all those took longer than I thought.
812485 You really think Mrs Cake will like these new sprinkle shakers?
812066 Mm-hmm. Now she won't have to use rainbow sprinkles all the time. She can just pick the color she wants!
812000 [bell ringing]
81202a Ooh! I'm sorry, I was out to lunch. Were you fillies waiting for me long?
812485 No. Um, these are for you!
81202a Oh, well, what a lovely surprise! I can't wait to try them out!
812000 [sprinkles shaking]
81202a Look! I made rainbow sprinkles! Aren't they wonderful?
812485 But... she... I... [groans]
812066 At least she likes her present?
812485 Uh-huh...
812000 [thuds]
812000 [whistling]
812485 Golly. How'd you know that would make him so happy?
81200a Friendship means pitchin' in to help others' chores go faster. 'Specially when their special somepony's waitin' for 'em.
812000 [school bell ringing]
812000 [students chattering and laughing]
812065 [groans] That class was so boring!
812066 Not even Miss Cheerilee can make the history of radishes exciting.
81200a I bet they don't have to learn about that stuff at Twilight's school.
812000 [zoom!]
812000 [crash!]
812485 Guess what! I got an A on my homework!
812065 [cheers]
81200a Nice goin'!
812485 And I never could have done it without your help!
812066 No problem!
812065 We just wish we could have done more.
812485 Actually, you can. Headmare Twilight is giving us a big test at the end of the week, and I could really use your help studying.
81200a We wanted to go to Twilight's school more than anything. But helpin' you has been even more fun! You can count on us!
812000 [montage music]
812000 [Angel munching]
812000 [magic noises]
812485 Um... intelligence?
812000 [magic noises]
812000 [clattering]
812081 [laughing]
812485 [giggles]
812000 [music continues]
812486 [giggling]
812485 Laughter?
812066 Yes!
812485 Is it... control?
812000 [wind blowing]
812000 [bushes rustling]
812485 Kindness! Loyalty! Honesty! Generosity! Laughter! Magic!
812487 [cheering]
812000 [students laughing]
81200a How'd the test go?
812066 Were there essay questions?
812065 Did you remember what we taught you?
812485 I... failed! [crying]
81200a But how could Cozy Glow fail her friendship test?
812003 Ahem. I'd like to see you three in my office!
812065 [quietly] I know we wanted to be invited inside, but it kinda went different in my head.
812003 I can't believe you'd do something like this!
81200a Like what?
812003 You are Cozy Glow's tutors, aren't you?
812065 We've been working with her for days!
812003 That's what she told me. So you've been setting her up to fail?
812105 What?!
81200a How?!
812003 I know you're upset that I won't let you come to my school, but to teach Cozy all the wrong things out of spite... That's just cruel!
812066 But we taught her all the right things!
812003 Then how do you explain these friendship test answers? [reading] "What are the six Elements of Harmony?" Five turtlenecks and a cheese grater? "Who is the Princess of Friendship?" Your mom?
81200a I... I don't understand.
812003 Me neither. I never thought you three would pull such a mean prank. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to stay away from my school. And my students.
812000 [door closes]
812485 Oh, no!
81227c Hmm? [dryly] Yay. Now I'll alphabetize them in reverse order. [sighs] Not much need for a guidance counselor at a school of friendship.
812485 [clearing throat]
81227c Aah!
812000 [thud]
81227c How much of that did you hear?! Uh, never mind.
812000 [teleportation zap]
81227c [laughs nervously] Welcome! Can I get you a comfort pillow? Security blanket? Empathy cocoa?
812485 Uh, I just need some advice.
81227c Oh! Well, I have plenty of that! Anecdotes, insight, midnight confessions... I'm babbling. [clears throat] Go ahead. I'm listening.
812485 I think I got my friends in trouble. They helped me study for my friendship test, and I failed it... on purpose.
81227c Why would you do that? Uh, sorry. Listening. [sips cocoa]
812485 Well, the Cutie Mark Crusaders wanted to go to this school more than anything. So I thought if I showed Headmare Twilight they're bad at friendship, she'd let them come here with me.
81227c That's devious. I-I mean, I see. [sips cocoa]
812485 I guess I still have a lot to learn about friendship.
81227c Actually, I think you're doing all right. Sure, that was a really, really bad way to try to help your friends, but what matters is you wanted to. The reason the Cutie Mark Crusaders don't go to this school is because they'd make better teachers than students.
812485 So you do have a place for them here?
81227c Hmmm...
812000 [students chattering]
812000 [scraping]
81200a [groans] I bet there's no "Wonderful World of Cleaning" lesson at Twilight's school.
812066 [coughs] We'll never find out now.
812065 [sighs] I still don't get how Cozy failed her test after all that studying.
812066 Or how Twilight could blame us for it!
81200a Or how gum can be so sticky!
812000 [knock on door]
81227c Sorry to interrupt, Miss Cheerilee. But can I borrow Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?
812000 [ominous music]
812065 We didn't do anything wrong! We promise!
812003 I know that. Now. Which is why I wanted to talk to you.
812066 Wait. So we're not in trouble?
81227c Just the opposite. Cozy Glow, is there something you'd like to say?
812485 This is all my fault. I messed up my test on purpose so we could all go to school together. I'm sorry.
812003 Thank you, Cozy Glow. Honesty is one of the pillars of friendship. [to Cutie Mark Crusaders] But you already know that. Which is why I'd like to give you these.
812000 [thud]
812005 [groans]
812008 They're honorary diplomas, makin' y'all official graduates of this here school.
81200d You've more than earned them.
81200c Without even having to study!
812007 [cheering]
812080 [chanting] We are graduates! We are graduates! We are graduates!
812003 And if you're interested, I think Starlight has a place for you at my school after all.
812080 Woo-hoo!
81227c We could use some friendship tutors on staff. And I hear you're the best out there.
81200a Then what are we waitin' for? Let's get tutorin'! Come on, Cozy!
812003 And that's why this school needs you as our guidance counselor.
812487 [laughing]
812000 [credits]
813003 [sighs] I've been planning this retreat for weeks, and we're already ten minutes behind! Where is that photographer?!
813488 ...No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
813000 [doors open]
813488 I'm so sorry! Can you forgive me? I don't expect you to forgive me... Forgive me?
813003 [groans]
81327c Of course. I'll help you set up your—
813488 Princess Twilight, thanks so much for this! The Canterlot Historical Society is thrilled to document the friendship work your teachers do! Let me just pretty you all up!
813000 [poink!]
813488 Ooh!
813000 [poink!]
813000 [poink!]
813488 [giggles] Ooh!
813000 [poink!]
813000 [poink!]
81300c Ow! Hey!
813488 Don't want a single hair out of place, do we? This is for the history books! Now...
813000 [camera flashing]
813488 Well, that's that! Bye!
813007 Waaaait! You forgot Starlight! She needs a picture, too!
813488 'Kay.
813000 [camera flashing]
813488 Now I'll get out of your manes. I know how busy you are.
813488 Now I have everything I need.
813000 [transformation noise]
81319c [maniacal laughter]
813000 [theme song]
81319c Yes, I know! We have been planning this for quite some time. [laughing evilly] Oh, thank you, Applejack. My spell can create a copy of anypony I desire. All I need is an image and a piece of the pony. [sniffs] Oh, and this.
813000 [magic zap]
81319c Why copies, Rarity? Because Princess Twilight and her friends control the Elements of Harmony, the most powerful weapon in all Equestria.
813000 [magic zap]
81319c Which means you - will - be - able - to - use - them - too!
813000 [magic zap]
81319c And serve me!
813000 [magic zap]
81319c Together, we will destroy Twilight Sparkle and her meddlesome friends!
813000 [magic zap]
81319c Of course I haven't forgotten Starlight Glimmer! She stole my hive. Turned my subjects against me! So I'll take her friends away while she watches! And then, I'll destroy her! [maniacal laughter]
813000 [magic zap]
81319c With the Elements under my control, I'll build a new hive of Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi, and I will rule as Queen once again!
813000 [magic sounds]
813000 [cracking]
813000 [magic sounds]
813003 Hmm. At least our retreat isn't too far behind schedule. Get ready for fun!
81300c Are we talking fun fun, or learning pretending to be fun?
813003 Both! We've all been so busy teaching, we've hardly had a chance to hang out with each other. And I may have scheduled some friendship activities as well!
813007 Count me in! We can do friendship trust falls and pony pyramids! Oh! And hide and seek! Quick! Find me!
81300e Well, I love the idea of some quiet time with my best friends.
813007 [screams] You found me!
81300c Rarity, why is Applejack carrying all your stuff?
81300d Oh, that's not mine. Yes, I used to overpack a tad, but now it's just the essentials for me. I'm a simple filly.
813008 Normally I wouldn't lug so much gear, but did y'all know this is Starlight's first time campin'?
81327c I just never really felt the need to... "hang out" in nature.
813000 [insects buzzing]
81327c Home has books, tea, fewer bugs, a roof...
813008 That attitude right there is why I brought the whole kit and caboodle. I'm givin' Starlight the full Apple family campin' experience!
81300e Um, where are we camping?
813003 Right next to the Elements that brought us all together in the first place – the Tree of Harmony!
81319c Listen to your queen! We must retrieve the Elements of Harmony!
813489 Hunting down some lame Elements? This is the worst day ever!
81348a No. Now it's the worst day ever! [laughing cruelly]
81348b Those Elements are mine! Along with this rock! Oh, and that twig!
81348c I got all kinds o' Elements right here under my hat. I'll let you see 'em for five bits.
81348d [scoffs] Losers.
81348e Why didn't you just attack them?
81319c Excuse me?
81348e You were close enough to pull hairs from their manes. Why not just take your revenge then?
81319c They've defeated my army. I know better than to strike alone. I need—
81348e Friends?
81319c Servants! And the power of the Elements!
81348e Right. So where are these Elements of Harmony?
81319c The location of the most powerful weapon in Equestria isn't something made known to just anypony. I learned they were hidden somewhere in this forest.
81348e Yeah, well, it is a big forest.
81319c [growling]
813007 Everypony, stop! And smell these roses! [sniffs] Ahhh! Oh, yeah!
813003 [nervous giggle] Right. Roses. Fun. Now, let’s try and stay on schedule.
81300d Applejack, darling, anything in that wagon for mane maintenance?
813008 Uh, let's see here. Uh... all right. I got a bandana!
81300d Ugh, an entire wagon and no anti-frizz? Darling, you're not even prepared.
813008 I am! For campin'? How ya doin', Starlight?
81327c Whoa! Ugh. [flatly] Great.
81348f [tweeting]
81300e Oh, no! You and your sister fell out of your nest and got separated? That's terrible! Here. I'm sure your home isn't too far away.
813000 [swing creaking]
813003 [yelps] Pinkie! If we keep stopping to have fun, we're never gonna get to the fun things I've got planned!
813007 [gasps] Good point! Last one to the Tree of Harmony is a parasprite! Whoo-hoo!
813003 [sighs]
813000 [thud]
813489 I'm sooooo bored. Are we there yet?
81348e Where yet? We don't even know where we're going!
81319c The quicker we search the forest, the quicker we find the Elements.
81348c I know where the Elements are. This, uh, here boulder just told me. I swear.
813490 [tweeting]
81348a You tried to fly out of the nest, but you fell and got lost?
813490 [tweeting]
81348a [laughing cruelly] Hope you like walking! [laughing cruelly]
81348d [yawns] Come get me when I should care.
81319c Where... are... the others?!
81348c Uh... A, uh, a bugbear in... plaid socks flew down and, uh, g-grabbed them! Then disappeared! Huh. Craziest thing I ever did see!
81319c Turn around. We're going back.
81348e No. Keep searching. I'll find the others. We can accomplish more if we split our resources.
81319c Very well. You have my permission.
81348e "Permission"? You need us way more than we need you, your Majesty! The others are fools. But with me to lead them, there's no reason we can't find the Elements and keep the power for ourselves!
813000 [rustling]
81348e [gasps]
813007 You're it! Hey, how'd you get ahead of me? You're fast.
81348e Ugh! I'm looking for Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash.
813007 Aren't they back there?
81348e They are?
813007 Sure! Unless they're already at the Tree of Harmony.
81348e What is the Tree of Harmony?
813007 Oh-ho-ho. This is one of your "activities", right? Like a friendship quiz? It's the crystal tree that holds the Elements of Harmony. Boom!
81348e [gasps] Where is it?
813007 [imitates buzzer] It's at the bottom of the stairs in the ravine by the Castle of the Two Sisters. Double boom!
81348e How do you know? You've seen it?
813007 Mm-hmm. Honestly, Twilight, these questions are super easy.
81348f [tweeting]
81300e Right where you belong.
81348f [tweets]
81300e Oh, dear. This isn't where I belong. Oh, Rainbow Dash! I'm so glad you're here. I was lost.
81348d Bummer. Later.
813000 [beat]
81300e What just happened?
813491 [overlapping] Fluttershy!
813003 Oh, fantastic. First Pinkie races ahead of us, and now Fluttershy's lost somewhere behind us. My retreat is off to a great start!
81300d It's not like Fluttershy to disappear like this.
813008 We'll split up and search for her. We can all meet back at the Tree. Starlight, take the navigation gear and—
81327c [quickly] Go with Rarity? Great! Rainbow Dash, you can go with Applejack! [chuckles]
813003 I'll find Pinkie Pie.
813489 Bored. Bored. Bored.
81319c This is ridiculous! Where are my other minions?!
81348b Probably plotting to steal my things! [growls]
81348c They're at a secret party up in that there tree. Run by a... squirrel named, uh, Jerome. But, uh, y-you need a password to get in.
81319c [growls] Enough!
813000 [thud]
813000 [slam!]
81319c You will go out there and find the others, you will bring them back here, and we will steal the Elements of Harmony so I can destroy Starlight's life like she destroyed mine! [through gritted teeth] Understand?
813492 [nervously] Uh-huh!
81348c The party password is "rutabaga".
81348a [mockingly] Why don't you fly up to your nest? Oh, that's right. You can't! [laughing cruelly]
81348f [tweeting]
81348a Oh. Nopony asked you. I hope you all freeze this winter!
813000 [mice squeaking]
81348a [laughing cruelly]
81300e Hello again, little friend. I think I may be walking in circles.
81348f [tweeting angrily]
81300e [gasps] Oh, my! Where did you learn that kind of language? Um, excuse me?
813000 [animals growling and chittering angrily]
81300e [whimpering]
81348b Finally, you found her!
81300c Me? We're looking for Fluttershy!
813008 Where's Starlight?
81348b Well, if I knew that—
81300c [grunts] Hey!
81348b This is mine! And this as well! Oh, and this is absolutely mine!
813008 Rarity, what in the hay are you gonna do with a fishin' rod?
81348b I don't know. But I wants it! [snorts]
813000 [thud]
81300d Starlight, darling, you're a gloriously bad camper. And coming from me, that is saying a lot.
81327c I know. Want to break it to Applejack for me?
813000 [rustle]
81348c Who's breakin' what now?
813000 [thud]
81348c Who are you?
81327c Very funny, Applejack. Still me under all this gear. Starlight.
81348c Starlight? How 'bout that? Y'all better come with me. It's, uh, dangerous out here.
81300d Applejack, darling, are you all right? You look a little peaky. And where's your wagon?
81348c Uh... stolen! Uh, I barely got away! Follow me, and I'll tell ya all about it.
813000 [clattering]
813003 Pinkie! There you are! What are you doing?
813000 [pop!]
813489 You call that a pop?! Ugh!
813003 I thought you were racing to the retreat.
813489 Please. Why would I waste my time on a boring, lame, no-fun retreat?
813003 What? Rainbow Dash! I think something's wrong with Pinkie!
81348d Not my problem.
813000 [splash!]
813003 [groans]
813000 [pop!]
813007 And then we all grew super-long manes with all kinds of colors, and your castle grew out of the ground, and everypony was like, "Whoa!" And then we sang this song about rainbows, and— [gasps]
81300e [crying]
813007 Fluttershy! What's wrong?
81300e [crying] Everycreature is mad at me!
813007 [gasps] What?! That can't be right!
81300e [crying, sniffling]
81348e [groans] Can we hurry this up? We're on a schedule here!
813007 Twilight, your schedule can wait! Fluttershy's upset.
81348e Well, tell her to get over it! I'll go get the others. Stay here!
81300e [crying, sniffling]
813003 Oh, great. You upset Fluttershy, too?
813007 You know what, Twilight? Maybe if you weren't so worried about schedules, you'd realize you're the one ruining the retreat for your friends!
813003 [gasps] Well, if my friends don't care about the retreat I planned for them... maybe they should've stayed home!
81300e Can't we all just get along?! [crying]
81348e Keep it together. You can do this. You need those imbeciles if your plan is gonna come together.
81319c Your plan?
81348e [gasps] Uh, the plan. I'm just trying to do your bidding, your Majesty.
81319c Grub-sitting you six is nothing like controlling my hive! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just destroy you all and start over!
81348e Because I know where the Elements of Harmony are. You need me.
81319c [maniacal laughter]
81348b Mine. Mine! [crazed laughter] All mine!
81300c [to Applejack] I'm guessing some kind of curse? Maybe poison joke?
813008 Well, somethin' sure ain't right.
81348b What are you plotting back there? I can hear you, you know! Don't think you're going to steal my things! [panting, spluttering]
813008 Hang on. I got a shovel we can use to whack those vines out of the way.
81348b [grunting] I knew it! I knew you wanted it all for yourselves! You can't have it!
813000 [thud]
81348b It's mine, you hear me?! All mi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hine! [crazed laughter]
81348c ...So there I was. Just me and, uh, a bucket of honey. Yeah, yeah, that's the ticket. Uh, b-but I-I survived all by myself in this here forest for, uh, a hundred and... twenty-seven hours!
81300d Really? I can't believe you've never told us that story before.
81327c She's making a point. We get it. You're the greatest camper in the history of Equestria.
81348c Well, I sure don't need any o' that silly stuff you're luggin' around.
81327c Uh, the things you gave me are silly?!
81348c [chuckles] Just look in a mirror. Guess I should've told you that before, huh? [chuckling]
81327c [gasps, tearing up] Glad I was so entertaining for you!
81300d [to Mean Applejack] I'm going to make sure that she doesn't break a hoof out there, and then you and I are going to have a serious talk!
81319c Finally! There. That's all of you. Nopony leaves without my say-so.
81348c Now, wait a second. Weren't you just—?
813000 [magic zap]
81348c [gulps]
81319c The time for my revenge on Starlight Glimmer has come! Let's see if you're telling the truth about this Tree. [maniacal laughter]
81300d Starlight! Oh! Please stop running!
813000 [screech]
81300d [yelps]
81327c Ugh!
813493 Whoa!
813000 [crash!]
81300e [crying]
813003 Of course I care about Fluttershy!
813007 Then you've got a super weird way of showing it!
81300d W-What in Equestria's going on here?
813007 Twilight is so into her retreat that she doesn't even care if her friends are upset! She just wants us to "stay on schedule"!
813003 Well, I'm sorry, Pinkie! If I knew you thought this was a "boring, lame, no-fun retreat", I wouldn't have invited you in the first place!
813007 I never said that!
813008 Sorry, y'all. We would've been here sooner, but we had to take the long way after Rarity ran off with all my stuff.
81300d Wha—?! I most certainly did not!
813008 What?! You know I ain't no liar! [to Starlight Glimmer] Where's all your gear?
81327c Why? So you can laugh at me some more?!
81300c Hey, hey, we're all friends here!
81300e Friends?! You left me alone in the woods! [crying]
813000 [Mane Six except Twilight arguing]
813003 Everypony, quiet! Listen. We know each other really well — the great stuff and how to get on each other's nerves, too. I wanted a fun trip with my friends. But instead, I got carried away with plans and ruined everything. If you want to forget it all and head home, I won't be offended. I just want us to stop fighting.
813008 [to Starlight Glimmer] Hey, sorry if I got carried away with all that campin' stuff.
81327c I'm sorry, too. I should've just told you I'll never like camping. Also, I'll never like camping.
81300d Well, if we're all being honest, I can't survive with just this tiny yet fashionable little saddlebag! I miss my things!
813007 [to Twilight Sparkle] I'm sorry that you thought that I thought your plan was lame. Your plans are the most un-lamest!
81300c And I always have fun when we're all together. Even if it's learning pretending to be fun.
813003 So... does that mean you still want to have the retreat?
813494 Yes!
81300e If everypony likes me again.
81304d [laughing]
813003 Let's get to that Tree. I have the whole campsite set up and ready.
813489 [groans] What's this garbage?
81348c Badger installation art! Ya see—
81319c Just! Retrieve! The Elements!
81348a [laughing cruelly]
81348b Mine! Mine!
813000 [clattering]
81348b Mine! [crazed laughter]
81348e Once we get the power of the Elements, no creature – not even her Majesty – can tell us what to do. Just follow my lead. Got it?
813495 [laughing evilly]
81348b Ooh! That one's mine!
813000 [ping!]
81348b [crazed laughter]
813000 [thud]
81348a Oops. I'd say sorry, but I'm not!
813496 [grunting]
81348e Stop it, fools!
813000 [ping!]
81348e We need the Elements to take out Chrysalis! [gasps]
81319c How dare you! I created you!
813000 [magic zap]
813000 [thud]
813000 [dull pulsating]

81348e [gasps]
813000 [magic sounds]
81348e Imbeciles! You ruined everythiiiiiiiing!
813000 [shimmering sounds]
813000 [clattering]
81319c Servants always fail you in the end! Just wait, Starlight. I will have my revenge!
813003 [gasps] Are you kidding me?
813007 [laughing] This was... the worst... day... ever!
81304d [laughing]
81327c Come on, everypony. We can fix this campsite in no time.
813008 Spoken like a true camper.
81327c Eh, don't push it.
813497 [chuckling]
813003 You know, if we can survive a day like this, I think our friendship is strong enough to handle anything the world can throw at us.
813000 [credits]
814000 [chest opens]
814003 Who can tell me what these are?
814188 Whoa...
814184 Me likey...
814187 Shiny!
814186 Treasure?
814189 Nope! They're all legendary magical artifacts!
814000 [beat]
814189 Heh-heh. I've read ahead in Equestrian Cultures and Camaraderie - Volume Seven.
814003 You're right, Ocellus. This is the Amulet of Aurora, the Talisman of Mirage, the Helm of Yksler, the Crown of Grover, Knuckerbocker's Shell, and Clover the Clever's Cloak.
814005 And the gems are real! Eh, not that I... tasted them.
814003 Princess Celestia gifted these to our school, since they each represent one of the cultures our students come from. And we'll learn all about them in a Spell-venger Hunt!
814000 [beat]
814186 [aside, to Sandbar] Is that a pony thing?
814188 Eh.
814003 It's a magical scavenger hunt. Each of you will work in pairs to try to find where in the school these artifacts are hidden.
814005 The team that finds the most wins a private tour of the Canterlot Archives with Princess Celestia.
814003 [giggles]
814185 [excited squeal] Learning and fun?! Does it get any better than that?!
814184 You've been underwater a long time, haven't you?
814003 Gallus and Silverstream, sounds like you're our first pair!
814183 [gasp]
814003 What? They'll make a great team.
814000 [cutie mark glowing]
814187 Um, why pony glowing?
814000 [doors open]
814003 Wait. You all were called on this friendship quest, too?
81400e It must be a really important one.
81400d And terribly far away.
81400c Just getting there will take days!
814008 Do y'all know what this means? There won't be any teachers left to run the school!
814024 [gasp]
814000 [theme song]
81400e Should we send our students home?
814007 I say we take 'em with us! Road trip!
81400d In the middle of my friendship quilting class? I think not! All of those unfinished seams! [faints]
814008 Problem is we don't even know how long we'll be gone.
814003 Don't worry, everypony. I already have a seventy-point plan in place for this very situation.
81427c You want me to be headmare?!
814003 You're the perfect choice! You're a good leader and an expert in friendship. I trust you to run this school exactly as I would.
81427c Uh, that's a pretty big responsibility, Twilight.
814003 Which is why I've prepared everything you need.
814000 [bell ringing]
814000 [door opens]
814003 The curriculum, rules for the Spell-venger Hunt, dining hall menus for the next six months...
814005 Six months?! You're not really gonna be gone that long, are you?
814003 ...and Spike. Anything that isn't covered in my files, he'll be able to help you with.
81427c Then why not put him in charge?
814005 No-ho-ho, thanks. Eh, being a princess for Twilight was hard enough.
81427c I'm gonna pretend that made sense. But if you're sure it's what you really want, I promise I won't let you down.
814003 I knew I could count on you.
814000 [door closes]
814005 [yells]
81427c Great. What could possibly go wrong?
814000 [galloping]
814005 Goodbye, Rarity! A-And everypony!
81427c Come back soon! Please!
8140db [blows nose]
81427c Huh?
8140db [through mock tears] I hate goodbyes, don't you? I just go to pieces.
814000 [pop!]
81427c Discord! What a... heh... nice surprise! This is your first time at our new school, isn't it?
8140db Oh, was I not invited to the grand opening?
8143d9 Friends and Family Day?
8143dd Baccalaureate?
8143df I hadn't noticed.
814000 [flash]
81427c Well, at least you're here now. Um, why are you here now?
8140db To fill in for Twilight, of course, as head-draconequus. I seem to recall a whole song about how this school is where you make your own rules. Now, who better at that than me?
814005 Then you also must've heard Starlight is in charge now.
8140db Really? I thought there must be some mistake.
814000 [flick]
81427c Nope. Twilight picked me for the job. And she left pretty detailed instructions for me to follow.
8140db Well, I'm sure that she wouldn't mind a few tiny suggestions. [snaps fingers]
814000 [flash]
8140db [writing] "Item one – Gravity is optional."
814000 [warbling]
81427c Whoa-oa!
8140db "Item two – The school's new mascot is an ambidextrous marmoset."
814000 [marmoset mascot squeaks]
8140db "Item three—"
81427c Not gonna happen. I promised Twilight I'd handle this her way. So thanks, but no thanks.
8140db Reeeeeeally? Well, we'll see if you change your mind. [snaps fingers]
814000 [flash]
814000 [splash]
814005 Uh-oh. When we play Ogres & Oubliettes and he puts that many E's in "really", the things don't usually end well.
81427c Don't worry, Spike. Discord and I are old "save Equestria" buddies. He'll be fine. Now, what's next on Twilight's list?
814000 [door opens]
814005 Okay. I hid the artifacts for the Spell-venger Hunt and ordered school supplies for the week. All you have to worry about is teaching class.
81427c [sighs] Thanks, Spike. Maybe we will get through this okay.
814000 [doors open]
814000 [peacocks call]
814000 [Castle Thunder]
814000 [typewriter clicking]
8140db Come in, come in. You'll let the twittermites out. [munches]
814005 Twittermites?
814000 [swarming]
814005 Ow!
814000 [splash]
81427c Discord! What are you doing?!
814005 [gasps for air]
8140db Nopony was at your desk. Imagine what Twilight would say. [imitating Twilight] Oh, how could you, Starlight?! You've broken my trust and failed me completely! [normal voice] Oh, don't worry. I'll cover for you. By the way, I hope you like Limburger cheese. I got a month's supply for the teacher's lounge. [snaps fingers]
814000 [flash]
814000 [crate opening]
814005 [screams]
814000 [squish!]
814005 [sniffs, gags]
81427c [gags] We'll take it from here, Discord. Go relax. Have a cup of tea. At home.
814000 [door stops]
8140db Oh! Some thanks for all my help. And after I hired all those substitute teachers for you.
814000 [splat]
814005 Actually, that does sound kinda helpful. And it was next on our to-do list.
81427c Which teachers did you hire?
814000 [stomp]
814165 They call it "making friends", because you have to make creatures be your friends! Show me what you've got, yak!
814187 [clears throat, quietly] Be my friend.
814165 If you're quiet, I don't buy it!
814187 [louder] Be my friend!
814165 I've heard pudding that's more convincing!
814187 [huffs, even louder] Be! My! Friend!
814000 [zip!]
81427c [quietly] That's not how Twilight teaches friendship.
81415c Some field trip! Where's my iced tea?! [sips, gulps, spits] This is too cold! [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too hot!
814000 [pours]
81415c [sips, gulps, spits] Now it's too tea-flavored!
814000 [clatter]
81415c You call yourselves friends?!
814005 That is definitely not how Twilight teaches friendship.
8140db [sips]
81427c You hired a tree as a teacher?!
8140db Its schedule was free.
814005 Uh, guys? That's not just any tree.
814186 [sneezes]
814183 [scream]
814005 [blows nose] It's a dragon-sneeze tree.
814186 [sneezes]
814183 [scream]
81427c W-W-W-Wait! Calm down, everycreature! It's gonna be okay!
814187 [yells] BE MY FRIEEEEENNNND!
8140db Mmmm, my, my, my. You do seem like you're in over your head. Won't Twilight be so disappointed with how you're ruining—I mean, running her school?
814183 [screaming]
81427c Discord!
8140db [munching]
81427c This is all your fault!
8140db Mine? I thought you were in charge here. But I'm happy to pitch in if you need me.
814000 [flash]
81427c What I need is for you to leave!
8140db [snaps fingers]
814000 [flash]
8140db Happy now?
814005 Come on, Discord. You know that's not what she means.
8140db Fine! From now on, I won't try to help. At! All!
81427c [groans] Thanks, Spike. Let's just hope he stays gone.
814005 I wouldn't count on it. I think Discord's trying to test you.
81427c But why? I thought we were friends.
814005 Well, it's kinda what he does. Even to ponies or dragons he cares about.
81427c Oh, well, I'm ready for him. I told Twilight I'd run her school right, and I'm gonna keep that promise. No matter what.
814000 [nighttime ambience]
81427c Good morning, students! I know there's been a little bit of adjustment since the professors left for their trip. But I've brought in new new teachers. And now everything should run smoothly. Now it's time for class. And don't forget, this afternoon is the Spell-venger Hunt!
814183 [chattering]
814000 [door slams open]
814000 [stock gasp sound]
8140db [California accent] Yo! Greetings, fellow creatures!
814000 [flash]
8140db Is this seat taken?
814189 [laughs nervously]
814000 [poof]
814037 Welcome, class! You may call me the Great and Powerful Professor Trrrrrri—
814000 [phone ringing]
8140db Shhh! Really, that's so inconsiderate!
814000 [phone ringing]
814000 [bananaphone ringing]
8140db Oh, I better take this. Hello?
814498 [garbled sped-up gibberish]
8140db Oh, he did not! And what did you say?
814498 [garbled sped-up gibberish]
8140db [gasps] You did not!
814037 Discord! Why are you here?!
8140db Why, I'm a student of friendship, of course. Unless you don't think you're good enough to teach me.
814037 Of course I am! No fruit calls in my class!
814000 [banana peels]
8140db [gulps]
814037 Magic is the most important element of friendship. So, today I, the Great and Powerful Trixie, will put on a magic show!
8140db [snaps fingers]
814000 [Pigasus squeals]
814000 [ursa major roaring]
814183 [scream]
8140db [chuckles] I'm learning so much. Aren't you?
814037 [growls] Discord!
814000 [doors close]
814000 [bananaphone ringing]
814000 [beep]
814037 Eh, hello?
814498 [garbled sped-up gibberish]
814037 Um, what exactly is a long-distance plan?
814187 [pants]
8140db Take a lap, team!
814188 Uh, actually, we just finished Professor Spitfire's workout.
8140db Sounds like somepony needs a little motivation. [blows whistle]
814000 [flash]
814183 [gasp, scream]
814000 [bugbear growls]
814185 I've never run so fast in my life! Oh, this is great!
814188 [pants] Hey, coach, we need a break.
8140db Friendship is about honesty. So believe me when I say... we're not stopping! [blows whistle]
814188 [yelps, pants]
814000 [bugbear growls]
814187 [panting] Yona... can't run... faster...! [grunts]
814000 [bugbear growls]
814000 [zap!]
814000 [bugbear whimpers]
81427c Discord, that's enough! Endangering students crosses the line! I don't know why you're trying to ruin this school, but it stops now!
814000 [flash]
8140db I wouldn't be so sure.
81427c This is your last warning.
814005 Hey-hey-hey! Take it easy, Starlight! Discord's your friend, remember?
81427c Well, he's not acting like it!
814005 [huffs] She's right, Discord. What's your problem?
8140db My problem? How is the fact that Twilight decided to put an incompetent, power-hungry unicorn in charge of her school my problem?!
81427c [gasps, yells]
814000 [zap!]
814000 [crackles]
814183 [shudder]
81427c [nervous laughter] Don't worry. I just banished him from school grounds forever. He's fine.
814005 That probably made things worse. Why didn't you just talk to Discord?
81427c Because he's right about one thing. I've been doing a terrible job as headmare.
814005 No, you haven't. Discord is just bein'... Discord.
81427c Maybe. But I wonder why me being in charge bothers him so much.
814000 [school bell rings]
814005 We can figure that out after the Spell-venger Hunt. C'mon!
814000 [doors open]
81427c For this afternoon's Spell-venger Hunt, you'll need to use the artifacts' history to find where they're hidden in the castle. When you spot one, touch it with a magic shield to keep track of your score.
814005 Twilight left the list of your hunt partners before she left. I'll pass out the shields.
81427c Ready... set... Spell-venger Hunt!
814000 [gong strikes]
814183 [chattering]
814005 C'mon! We can use Twilight's observatory to watch the teams!
814183 [chatter continues]
814186 I hope you know where you're going.
814189 To the Helm of Yksler!
814186 Eh, works for me.
814189 In our book, it says Yksler was an honorable yak warrior. Any enemies that saw him put down their weapons in peace. I think his artifact must be in one of these suits of armor.
814186 I'm guessing that one.
814000 [shields flash]
814189 Yes! One down, five to go!
814000 [slaps]
81427c Awww, Ocellus and Smolder found their first artifact! Wait. What's that?
814189 Uh, I don't think that's part of the Spell-venger Hunt!
814499 [scream]
814189 The school is haunted!
814186 And not cool!
81431f [gasp]
814185 We're totally gonna win this Spell-venger Hunt!
814184 Yeah, I doubt that. But at least I know where one of the artifacts is. Saw Spike hide it yesterday.
814000 [thud]
814184 The Crown of Grover! Score!
814000 [shimmer!]
814184 They say it's magic and King Grover used it to become the first ruler of Griffonstone. I know, pretty sweet, right?
814185 You paid attention in class!
814184 What?! I-If you ever tell an—
814000 [slam!]
814184 Whoa!
814185 3D painting!
81449a [screeches]
81449b [scream]
81449c [hisses]
814000 [students screaming]
81449d [hisses]
814000 [students screaming]
81449e [laughing]
81427c Yup, that's definitely Discord. This is not good.
814005 I thought you banished him from the school.
81427c Only his body. Apparently, his ghost can come and go just fine. Let's go. We have to stop this.
814000 [lift clanking]
814005 How? No offense, but I don't think magic is the answer against Discord.
81427c This time, I'm not using magic.
814187 Hmm... What Yona look for?
814188 The Shell of Knuckerbocker. It's like a seashell, but if you blow into it, you call a dragon! There's a sweet poem in our book about it. "Climb to the heights with dragon flight." [gasps] Like flight of stairs!
814187 Yona take pony word for it.
814000 [squish]
814187 Huh?
814188 [grunts] What's happening?!
814187 Ugh! Yona not know! But Yona do know Yona not like Spell-venger Hunt!
81449e [laughing] Boo! Boo! Boo!
814000 [students screaming]
814189 [yelps] Whoa!
81427c Everycreature, stop!
814185 B-B-B-But the school is haunted!
81427c It's not haunted. It's Discord.
814000 [poof!]
81449e Headmare Starlight! Look at me! Look! I won the Spell-venger Hunt! Well done, me! Now what's my prize?
814005 Detention.
81449e Well, that's disappointing.
81427c Discord, you can't keep messing up the school.
81449e On the contrary. I think I rather can. And will.
81427c Then I have just one thing to say to you.
81449e Oh, do go on.
81427c I'm sorry.
81449e What?
814000 [zap!]
81427c I had to stop thinking like a headmare and start thinking like a guidance counselor to finally understand. You felt left out.
8140db Uh... [stuttering] I don't know what you're getting at.
81427c Nopony ever invited you to the school. And when you offered to help, I didn't listen. I was so worried about doing things Twilight's way, I didn't stop to think about being a good friend. I'd like to apologize for that. And offer you the job of vice headmare.
814005 Huh?
814185 Really?!
814184 What?!
814189 Why?!
814187 No!
814186 Him?!
814188 Totally confused.
8140db I accept! I mean, I-I-I suppose I can find some time in my busy schedule to help you out. But I will need my own office, expense account, parking space...
814005 You're new to the world of education, aren't you?
81427c Next time you want something, just ask for it, all right?
8140db But then we'd miss out on all those delightful misadventures.
814005 Hey! Watch the wings!
81427c Now, Vice Headmare Discord, if you'll help me get this Spell-venger Hunt back in order.
8140db [snaps fingers] Everything is re-hidden.
814000 [rattling]
814185 [screams]
8140db [chuckles] Well, with a few surprises.
814000 [doors open]
814003 Discord! I can't believe you tricked us into going on a friendship quest that wasn't real!
8140db Oh, back so soon?
81400d A glamour spell on our cutie marks?
81400c A fake summons from the map?
814007 Hey, at least we got to go spelunking in that really creepy cave with all those eyeless worm creatures chasing us.
814187 Oh, Yona so glad ponies back!
814008 Uh, y'all get the feelin' we missed somethin'?
814003 Thanks for taking care of the school, Starlight.
81427c It was a challenge. Heh. But I think things turned out just the way you'd have handled them.
814005 [to Discord] Guess this means you're not vice headmare anymore.
8140db Oh, poo! I just ordered business cards!

815187 Not everycreature celebrate same way, you know.
815186 Yeah. Dragons don't do pony holidays.
815005 Sure we do! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! It's all about friends and presents and family and... presents!
815003 It's also about putting aside differences to come together, like the Earth ponies, Pegasi, and unicorns did on the first holiday.
815189 Oh! Is that why you put their Fire of Friendship on top of the tree? To help us remember their unity?
81500c And 'cause it looks cool.
815185 This is my favorite day of the year! [giggles] Not that I don't like the other ones. Tuesdays are great!
815187 Yona like any day that is start of winter break.
815184 Two whole weeks without classes. How will Ocellus survive?
815189 [laughs nervously]
815003 I think you'll all enjoy the time off to be home with your families. To celebrate your own traditions. Attention, everycreature! School is officially out! Happy holidays, and we'll see you after the break!
815000 [excited chatter]
815003 And for those of you traveling outside Equestria...
81500c Yeah, shouldn't you guys be getting ready to go? If you miss that train, it's a really long walk.
815003 Go pack up, and we'll take you to the station.
815183 [chatting excitedly]
815000 [rattling]
815005 It's that new bowtie I wanted, isn't it?
815003 You'll have to wait and see.

815005 Over there!

81500c I'll check the back door!
815000 [door opens]
815185 What's happening? [gasps] Another decorating party?
815003 Has anycreature come in here?
815186 Well, yeah. All of us did. To pack? Like you told us to?
815005 After that. Did you hear anything?
81544b Uh-uh.
815000 [door opens]
815184 What's up?
815000 [door opens]
815187 Yona done packing!
815000 [door opens]
815189 Is something wrong?
81500c [grunts] The back door's locked! No way out!
815003 But whoever did it had to have come in here! We saw them!
815189 Whoever did what?
815188 Whoa... That is so not cool.
815005 And whoever did it ran into your rooms. No one came out, and all of you are still here.
81500c One of you must have done this! But... why would any of you want to sabotage Hearth's Warming Eve?
815183 [muttering nervously]
815187 Ugh! Yak not do this! Yona offended by accusation!
815003 We don't know what happened. Maybe this wasn't even on purpose. But I want to give whoever caused this mess a chance to tell the truth and explain themselves. I'll make it easy for you. Close your eyes. Now, if you did this, raise your hoof. Or claw. Or whatever.
815000 [beat]
815003 [sighs] Come on, Spike. Looks like we have to— Spike, you can open your eyes.
815005 What? Oh!
81500c Uh, what about me?
815003 You all can.
81500c [chuckles]
815003 But since nocreature took responsibility for this mess, you're all gonna have to help clean it up before you can go home.
815183 [protesting]
815186 Why do I have to stay?!
815188 Aw, but the holidays!
815000 [magic sounds]
815003 While you're cleaning, we'll bring you into my office one at a time. Since honesty is one of the Elements of Harmony, we want to give you each a chance to tell us the truth.
81500c And once we find out who did it, just you wait! We're gonna...! We'll...! What are we gonna do exactly?
815003 [sighs] The guilty party won't be going home over Hearth's Warming break. She or he will stay here for some one-on-one friendship lessons.
815185 But what if none of us confesses?
815003 Then... [sighs] I guess there's no holidays for anycreature. You'll all stay over the break.
815183 [gasp]
815000 [water splashing]
815000 [splat]
815000 [door opens]
815003 All right, let's get to the bottom of this. Who wants to be interviewed first?
815184 Eh. I'll go. Beats mop duty.
815185 Hey, I know! We can make a game out of this! See who finishes cleaning up first!
815187 Woo-hoo! Yak win! Yak best at cleaning! [grunting]
815186 Let's save time and cut to the chase. Which one of you did it?
815189 I would never do something this horrible! I love Hearth's Warming Eve! And I do not want to miss going home for it.
815188 Huh. I didn't even know changelings celebrated Hearth's Warming.
815189 Oh, yes! It's our favorite holiday! Well, since Headmare Twilight shared it with us last year. She gave our hive very clear instructions.
815189 [clears throat, reading] "Welcome to the traditions and fun of Hearth's Warming! Here's a guide to help you enjoy this celebration of pony history. Families start the holidays by putting the tree up!"
815000 [creaking]
815189 [reading] "Thirsty? Dive into some holiday punch!"
815000 [splash!]
81519f [laughing]
815189 [reading] "Just before bed, everypony exchanges gifts."
815189 It doesn't say how long we keep doing this.
815189 [reading] "And to finish celebrating, you can build a fire, light it up, and sing carols."
815000 [Changelings]:
815000 Carols, carols, carols, carols, caroooools
815000 [laughing]
815188 You might have misunderstood things just a little.
815189 Eh. We may not have done everything exactly the way you do. But we made our own traditions! And I can't wait to do it all again this year!
815186 If we ever get out of here.
815003 Ocellus? Your turn.
815000 [foreboding music]
815000 [doors close]
815185 What happened?
815184 What do you think happened? I told her I didn't do it.
815187 Ugh! Yona tired of waiting! Yaks always home for holidays!
815188 How do you celebrate Hearth's Warming in Yakyakistan, Yona?
815187 Yaks do not. Our holiday much better. Is called Snilldar Fest. Night before, yaks gather things to smash and put them in big pile. Then in morning, we smash them! In afternoon, we smash them again! In evening—
815184 So it's just about smashing stuff, like all your other holidays.
815187 No! How griffon get that idea? This holiday about so much more. Last year, for example. Most perfect Snilldar ever.
815187 [voiceover] Whole family – grandpa, grandma yak, Yona's brother, sister, mother, father yak – all go to woods singing yak song.
815000 [Yona and family]
815000 Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
815000 Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
815000 Yak song! Yak song! Not very long! Sing again!
815187 [voiceover] Calves in family pick out perfect smashing log. Then yaks smash it!
815000 [yaks yelling and grunting]
815187 [voiceover] Then yak family build perfect snow fort... and smash it!
815000 [crash!]
815187 [voiceover] Then we hang perfect things on perfect moss pile and—
8154a0 You smash it.
815187 What you think yaks are, barbarians? Moss pile is for special family rituals. Last year, ritual for Yona.
815187 [voiceover] All yak family gather around Yona and braid Yona hair for first time.
815184 So, to recap... Your holiday is about smashing things and family.
815187 Two most perfect things ever put together. Happy Snilldar Fest! [yelling and grunting]
815185 Happy Snilldar to you too, Yona! It's so cool to learn new traditions from new friends!
815000 [clatter]
815186 Yeah, well, one of these new friends has gotten us all in trouble. And they'd better confess soon.
815189 Sandbar? Sorry, but they said they want you to go in next.
815000 [mop clatters]
815185 Why the rush to get home, Smolder? Like you said, dragons don't really have holidays, do they?
815186 Meh.
815189 [gasps] That's so sad! You must do something in the winter for fun.
815186 Well, we do have the Feast of Fire. Everydragon gets together and tells stories. The best one wins a pile of gemstones.
815187 Ooh, what story won last year?
815186 It was called "A Dream Come True".
815185 Come on, now you've gotta tell it!
815186 Ugh, fine. Once upon a time, there was this sad little dragon.
815000 [thunderclap]
815186 [narrating] Her name was Scales. She lived alone in the wilderness with nothing to eat.
815000 [stomach growls]
815186 [narrating] But one night, as she sat alone in a storm, she heard something. It was the Dragon Lord! Scales was scared, but the Dragon Lord told her not to be afraid, that he was taking her to the Dragon Lands for a great feast.
815000 [dragons munching]
815186 [narrating] Scales sat with the Dragon Lord's family and friends and had the biggest, best dinner of gemstones she'd ever eaten! Then, while the dragons were telling stories, Scales thought it would be so easy to seize power from this feeble and sensitive Dragon Lord. She saw her chance... and took it!
815000 [flames bursting]
815186 [narrating] She claimed the Bloodstone Scepter and took over the Dragon Lands! [as Scales, evil laughter] And forced the Dragon Lord to live out in the cold, just as she used to!
815189 That's a horrible story!
815186 Maybe to you. But dragons like hearing about weak, kind creatures getting defeated.
81500c Silverstream! You're up! Let's go!
815000 [door closes]
815186 So, did you tell them you did it?
815188 What?! No way! Why would I say that?
815186 You already live in Ponyville. Staying here over break is no big deal.
815187 School of Friendship good place for pony to have pony holiday.
815188 I'd still rather spend it with my family at home. Oh! That reminds me! I have the best holiday story ever! It's called...
815188 [voiceover] "The Day My Hearth's Warming Doll Almost Fell into the Fire!"
81547f [sounds of awe]
815188 [voiceover] Just before we went to bed, my mom, my dad, and my sister all put our Hearth's Warming Dolls up on the mantel, just like we do every year. But this year, I put my doll too close to the edge, and it fell!
815188 [in slow motion] Nooooooo!
815189 [gasps] And?!
815188 My doll hit the floor. But it could have gone in the fire!
815186 [sarcastic] That's a great story. And you told it really well.
815188 Yeah. It was a Hearth's Warming miracle.
815000 [door opens]
81500c Next! Smolder, come with me. Yona, Twilight's waiting for you.
815000 [door closes]
815189 The last two. So if neither one of them confesses, that means...
815185 We're never going home!
815189 We'll be here forever!
815188 Beyond forever.
815185 But I can't miss the Three Days of Freedom Celebration!
815184 [sarcastic] How long does that last?
815185 It used to be only one day, but now to commemorate our escape from the Storm King, we're adding two more days of awesome! See?
815184 There's a book?
815185 Mm-hmm! Queen Novo had these made for the Mount Aris board of tourism to explain it all to guests!
815185 [voiceover] We'll spend the first night in Seaquestria, thanking the ocean for protecting us from the Storm King. Sea-dancing, whale-singing, shell-stringing... Lots of "ing"'s.
815000 [splash]
815185 [voiceover] The second day will be on Mount Aris, with sky-dancing and a wind song in the Harmonizing Heights to celebrate the Storm King's defeat. Then the third day, everycreature will party together, on land and sea! Grandparents and parents and sisters, uncles, brothers, acquaintances, neighbors, and cousins. And at the end of the night, Queen Novo is gonna give out presents!
815184 Wait. Hold on. "Cousins"? What are those?
815189 Your aunts and uncles' children. You know, part of your family. Heh. Oh. You're teasing us again, right?
815000 [door opens]
815188 I'm guessing neither one of you confessed.
815187 [sighs] Headmare Twilight say wait here.
815185 Maybe they're changing their minds about sending us home.
815186 Why would they? Face it. We're stuck here.
815189 [sniffles] But-but-but I have to go home!
815185 My mom makes the best kelp fritters.
815188 How can you be so cool about this?
815186 We're mad. We just show it differently.
815188 More like you don't show it at all.
815187 What pony getting at?
815185 Maybe it wasn't just one prankster. Maybe there were three of you. And you're trying to hide your guilt by not being upset!
815189 It does make sense.
815184 Guys, stop it.
815186 Or maybe whoever did it is only pretending to be upset to throw us off.
815189 Me?! But I didn't!
815184 Come on, let it go.
8154a1 [arguing]
815188 Come on! Ocellus, you know you did it! Just fess up!
8154a1 [shouting]
815184 I said, stop fighting! That's not what the holidays are about! No matter what you call them or how you celebrate! D-Do you know how lucky you all are? With your stories about sharing and-and kindness and getting together with everycreature that you care about?
815189 But griffons do that too, don't they?
815186 Some holiday about a moon?
815184 [sighs] Blue Moon Festival. The one time of year when griffons are nice to each other. Well, as nice as we can be.
815184 [voiceover] Families get together to eat and then complain about the food and give each other presents they don't like and mostly just try not to yell at each other.
815185 Well, at least you get to be with your family.
815184 No... because I don't have a family.
815188 [voiceover] What about Grampa Gruff?
815184 [voiceover] That's just his name. He's not anygriff's actual grandpa. I felt like I never had a place in Griffonstone.
815184 Then I came here and, well, met all of you. So I don't want to go home for the break. And that's why... I did it!
815187 [gasps] Griffon mess up decorations?!
815184 Yeah. It was me. I put goo powder in the Fire of Friendship.
8154a1 [gasps]
815188 So it wasn't Ocellus?
815189 Why would you ruin things for us?
815184 I didn't plan to! I just figured if I made a mess, our teachers would make us stay to clean up. We'd be together a little longer.
815186 Well, it worked, didn't it?
815184 Better than I thought. And when Headmare Twilight threatened to cancel winter break, that meant I would get to be with all of you through the entire holiday. That's why I didn't confess.
815188 So, why are you admitting this now?
815184 I hated seeing all you fighting and-and blaming each other. That's the opposite of what all your holidays mean. Except maybe yours, Smolder. I can't keep all of you from the happiness of your homes and families just because I feel bad. I'm sorry. Don't worry. You won't have to tell our teachers. I will.
815003 You don't have to. We already know.
81500c We kinda guessed it was you. But we wanted to give you the chance to tell the truth.
815003 I'm proud that you did, and I'm glad to see you've been paying attention in Professor Applejack's honesty classes. But you're still going to have to make amends and stay over break for extra friendship lessons by yourself.
815185 I'll stay with him.
815189 Me, too!
815187 Yona stay also!
815188 I'm staying!
815000 [beat]
815186 What? All right. I guess pony holidays can't be that bad.
815188 Now you can finally know what it's like to spend Hearth's Warming with friends who care about you.
81500c [whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Looks like they don't really need any extra lessons.
815003 Since you obviously know that Hearth's Warming is about coming together, I'd be honored if all of you would join my friends as guests at our holiday table.
815183 [cheering]
815003 After we finish cleaning up.
815183 [cheering]
815188 Hey, this reminds me of another story! "The Time I Almost Spilled Grape Juice on the White Couch"!
815186 Does it have a depressing ending?
815189 I'm not sure pony stories work that way.
815187 Gallus want Yona braid feathers?
815184 Uhhh... pass.
815185 [Silverstream]
815185 Hearth's Warming Eve is here once again!
815000 [credits]
81643c [voiceover] Dear Twilight, it is difficult to express how grateful I am to you for teaching me the power of friendship.
81626e [grunts]
81643c [voiceover] You would think after more than a thousand years, there would be nothing left to learn.
816000 [wind whistling]
816000 [clang!]
81643c [voiceover] And yet, even a pony as old as I can continue to be surprised by how much there is to know.
816000 [teleportation zap]
816003 [reading] "I hope you find these postcards enjoyable, and I look forward to seeing you again, though I can't say when my journey will be complete. Your friend, Star Swirl."
81600d It must be gratifying to have your idol writing to you about the friendship lessons he's learning.
816003 I'm not sure I'll ever get used to it. Of course, if he really wants to learn about friendship, he could just come to our school.
816000 [door opens]
816485 Professor Sparkle? The mailpony just came with, uh, a few things.
816000 [door squeaks]
81600d Ooh! The sewing machines I ordered for my class!
816485 These came, too. I wasn't sure what to make of them.
81600d These machines were costly, but I am quite certain the friendship lessons I can teach my students with them will be invaluable.
816003 [sighs]
81600d Oh, don't worry, darling. I'll think of something. And I didn't use the school funds to buy these. I made the purchase entirely with my own bits.
816003 It's not that. It's this!
81600d [reading] "Why waste your time at a friendship school that's just a school? Learn everything they teach and more at Friendship University"?!
816000 [theme song]
816003 Who would open another friendship school?
81600d Oh, pfft! I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. You're the Princess of Friendship. What could this other school possibly offer?
816186 It isn't just another friendship school. It's a university!
816189 It says they teach the same lessons of competing schools in half the time. That's twice the learning!
816184 And it's in Las Pegasus? If Professor Rarity lets us skip her sewing class – road trip!
816183 [excited chatter]
81600d I think we need to look into this school.
81600d I don't like to judge solely on appearances. But... what kind of friendship school is this?
8164a2 Only the best friendship school in the west... and maybe all of Equestria!
816000 [ponies cheering]
816003 There's more ponies in here than at our whole school. Who is running this place?
816000 [clank]
816146 [echoing] Welcome, friends! You are about to embark on a journey of amazing magnitude! One that will change your lives forever!
816145 [echoing] Prepare yourselves to embrace a new path and become students of...
816147 Friendship U!
816003 Flim and Flam. Of course.
816146 [Flim]
816146 If you're alone and you can't make friends
816146 We understand your plight
816145 [Flam]
816145 Until now, there was just one way
816145 Your friendships could take flight
816146 [Flim]
816146 There is a school real far away
816146 That'll teach you what to know
816146 But if you live here, you couldn't stay
816145 [Flam]
816145 You'd learn you have to go-o-o-o
81600f Awww...
816146 [Flim]
816146 Now, there is an alternative to all of that adversity
816145 [Flam]
816145 Not just a school, I'll have you know
816000 [Flim and Flam]
816000 But a whole university
816000 At Friendship U, our aim is true
816000 In a city, not some backwater
816000 You'll learn the things you need to know
816000 At our new alma mater
816146 That's it, everypony, you heard correct!
816145 Friendship U, the one and only university of friendship!
816146 [Flim]
816146 As you can see, we're a success
816146 By any kind of stat
816003 [Twilight Sparkle]
816003 That may be so, for all I know
816003 But I still smell a rat
816145 [Flam]
816145 Everypony, lookie here
816145 That other school's headmare
816146 [Flim]
816146 Her presence is a testament
816146 To the mutual respect...
816000 [Flim and Flam]
816000 ...we sha-a-a-are
816003 What?! No, it isn't!
816145 [Flam]
816145 It really is the final piece
816145 To make our work complete
816146 [Flim]
816146 To have the Friendship Princess
816146 Bless our school is such a treat
816145 We're so honored!
816000 [Flim and Flam]
816000 At Friendship U, we teach to you (and you!)
816000 All of our friendship knowledge
816000 You'll learn it all in half the time
816000 At the one and only friendship college
816003 How can anypony learn friendship in half the time?
816145 Our coursework is so accelerated, to take longer would be a crime!
816146 [Flim]
816146 The lessons that we teach have been
816146 Reviewed and checked and edited
816145 [Flam]
816145 Which might explain why our new school's
816000 [Flim and Flam]
816000 About to be accredited
816000 At Friendship U, oh, yes, it's true
816000 Even the Princess of Friendship agrees
816000 The only place in Equestria
816000 To give out friendship degrees
816000 Yeah!
81600f [Ponies]
81600f Friendship U!
81600f Friendship U!
81600f Friendship U!
81600f Friendship U!
81600f Friendship U!
81600f Friendship U!
816146 That's it, everypony! Let's hear it! Tell us again why it's the best!
81604d [All]
81604d It's the only university of Friendship U!
816000 [Flim and Flam]
816000 Yeah!
816003 Accredited?
816145 It means officially recognized or authorized.
81600d We know what it means. But who would accredit this place?
8164a3 Why, the EEA, of course.
816003 Chancellor Neighsay?!
8164a3 The Equestria Educational Association has taken an interest in institutions that teach friendship in a pony-first environment. Surely you didn't think your school has a monopoly on the concept?
81600d Well, she did write the book on it.
8164a3 Ah, yes. How to teach friendship to creatures who will one day use it as a weapon against us.
816003 How could they use friendship as a weapon?!
8164a3 You tell me. It's your book. Meantime, this university appears to be a promising option for ponies who'd prefer to stick to the EEA book on the subject.
816003 You can't be serious. They're obviously up to something. It's Flim and Flam!
816146 [gasps] Well, that certainly wasn't friendly.
8164a3 One would think the headmare of a school of friendship – albeit an unaccredited one – would behave differently. Unless she was trying to undermine the competition? Hmm?
816000 [ponies gasp]
816003 I— No! What?! I-I am not!
816311 I did think the Princess of Friendship would be friendlier.
816145 Now, now, fillies and gentlecolts. Let's show the princess just how friendly we are by signing up for some classes!
816000 [ponies cheering]
816146 Why don't I show you around?
816003 I'm sorry, but approval from the EEA won't convince me that this school is what you promise.
816146 And what would it take to convince you?
816003 Well, somepony whose opinion I respect, for one.
816146 Really? Somepony like... this?
816000 [door opens]
8160dc [gasp]
81643c Twilight?
81600d Uh-oh.
816003 Star Swirl? What are you doing here?
81643c Why, studying friendship at Flim and Flam's wonderful school!
81600d Oh, please. I think I know a disguise when I see one. Take off that ridiculous beard... Flam!
816000 [stretching sound]
81643c [screams]
816145 How's it going in here?
816000 [snap!]
81643c [groans] It-It's really me.
8164a3 I'd heard rumors you've returned, but I didn't believe it until now. And if a pony of your stature is studying here, there really isn't anything else I need to see. I, Chancellor Neighsay, hereby confer upon Friendship University complete and unreserved EEA accreditation!
816003 I... I don't understand. Why would you come here and not my school?
81643c My travels brought me to Las Pegasus. I didn't come for the school, but Flim and Flam convinced me to try it out.
816003 You can't trust Flim and Flam! They tried to con the Apples out of their farm! They sold fake health tonic! They run a resort in Las Pegasus!
816145 Technically, our resort is a legitimate business.
81643c I spent a thousand years thinking the worst of a "bad" pony. You taught me to look for the best in him. Whatever Flim and Flam's past may be, starting this school shows they want to change for the better.
816003 I wish I could believe that.
81643c Besides, what's untrustworthy about opening a school of friendship? They don't even charge for classes.
816003 I don't know. But I know they're up to something. And until I find out, I'm begging you, come to my school instead.
8164a3 I understand feeling threatened by competition, but my word, Princess. I wonder if the ill manners of the creatures at your school aren't contagious. I think I will take my leave before I become infected.
81643c Twilight, I promise I'll visit your school soon. But for now, perhaps it's best if you return there.
816003 You don't think they're running an actual friendship school, do you?
81600d Darling, of course not. Which is why we have to investigate!
816003 But we can't go poking around the school. Everypony'll think I'm still just "threatened by the competition".
81600d Only if we do it as ourselves.
816000 [door opens]
816000 [door closes]
816000 [door opens]
816000 [door closes]
81600d In these disguises, we could pass as students at out own school.
816003 [muffled] I don't know, Rarity.
81600d Ah-ah. What did I say about using our real names?
816000 [door opens]
816003 Sorry, "Plainity". But I'm pretty sure this isn't enough of a disguise.
816000 [door closes]
8164a2 Hey, strangers! Are you two new here?
81600d [blows bubblegum] We sure are. Completely new.
8164a2 Great! See ya in class!
81600d [squeals] Now, I've read enough Shadow Spade to know the key to going undercover is rehearsing your backstory. [clears throat] [in affected voice] I'm "Plainity", and I love bland old normal stuff. No frills for me. [normal voice] Okay! Your turn.
816003 [groans] My name's Eyepatch. I have an eye patch.
81600d Perfect! Now, how do we start our investigation?
816003 I think we should split up. You enroll in some classes and find out what they're actually teaching. I'll look around and see what I can find, assuming I'm not recognized.
816145 Welcome, newest students! Let's dive right in, shall we? One of the most important elements of friendship is being thoughtful. True or false?
816000 [students chattering eagerly]
81600d If by "thoughtful" you mean "generous", I'd say true.
816145 Correct! [laughs] It was a trick question. Very impressive, Miss...?
81600d Plainity.
816145 Well, well, well, Miss Plainity, keep it up and you'll be ready for our next level in no time!
816000 [students' sounds of awe]
816145 Now, let's see if you can demonstrate for the class. What's something generous you could do for... me right now?
816000 [zip!]
816145 Class, Plainity here is now my star pupil. If any of you want a chance at studying with Star Swirl, I'd take notes on her every action.
816000 [writing sounds]
816000 [door creaks]
816003 Hello? The door is open, so I'll just assume it's okay to come in and look around. Unless somepony says it's not. All right, then.
816000 [door closes]
816003 [reading] "The Element of Laughter and its applications." Okay, that seems pretty genuine. "When to support your friends' decisions and when to talk sense." Huh. That's actually kind of interesting. Aha! "Friendship University's true goal... is to help friends become better friends"? [groans] Where is the proof that it's all a scam?
816145 There isn't any!
816000 [click]
816000 [camera flashes]
816146 Twilight Sparkle! Did you really think an eye patch was enough of a disguise?
816003 No, I didn't!
816145 Well, then we agree that everypony will recognize the Princess of Friendship in this photo of you sneaking into our office.
816146 I can see the headline now! "Princess of Jealousy! Twilight Sparkle Bent on Ruining Her Competition!"
816145 So sad. A news story like that would destroy your reputation. Nopony will want to go to your school after that.
816145 Just wait until the papers get a hold of this!
816146 "Princess Unhinged!" It'll be the talk of Equestria!
81643c Well, gentleponies, I've finished another stack. The lessons in these worksheets are quite fascinating. Twilight? What's going on here?
816146 Oh, just your protégé getting caught snooping in our office in disguise! Well, sort of.
816145 Oh, honestly, Princess Twilight, envy does not look good on you.
816003 I'm not envious! I know these two are up to something. I'm just trying to find out what.
81643c The only pony I see who is up to something is the pony in this picture, and it is not the princess I know.
816146 Well, it's about to be the princess all of Equestria knows.
816145 Unless... you decided to drop the whole "uncover the scam" thing.
816146 Then we'll rip this silly picture up and not let it completely and utterly ruin you and your school.
816003 [whimpers]
81600d You can be generous with all sorts of things. Gifts, compliments, your time.
816000 [ponies chattering excitedly]
81600d Hey, Eyepatch! Where's your eye patch? [gasps] Was your cover blown?
816003 You could say that. Flim and Flam took a picture of me sneaking into their office.
81600d Were we wearing our eye patch?
816003 If I don't stop investigating, they're going to tell everypony that I'm trying to sabotage their school because I'm jealous.
81600d But-But-But that's ridiculous!
816003 I don't know. Maybe I am just upset that Star Swirl came here instead of my school. Flim and Flam may have turned over a new leaf. We should probably just go home.
81600d Twilight, you are not the kind of pony to let your emotions cloud your judgment. If you think Flim and Flam are up to no good, you can't give up, even if their lessons really are impressive.
816003 Wait, what?!
81600d Which reminds me. Can you get a message to Spike? I want to return those sewing machines. I need the bits if I'm going to keep advancing here. Tuition's free, but the worksheets sure aren't. [laughs]
816003 Flim and Flam are charging for these?
81600d Well, they have to cover expenses, and Flam insists that everything extra goes to improving the school and—
816000 [beat]
81600d This is the scam, isn't it?
816003 Let's find out.
81643c These lessons are so valuable. Are you sure I can't give you more?
816145 Ah-ah-ah! Unnecessary! Being able to share them with a pony like you is our real reward. [to Destitute Pony] Oh, my. And you want to study alongside Star Swirl, hmm?
8164a4 It's all I have.
816000 [paper rips]
816146 Come back for the rest when you can afford it.
8164a4 W-Wait! I'll sell the shirt off my back!
816145 And that's the kind of determination that'll get you to the next level, student whose... name I know!
81600d [whispering] Twilight, maybe I should take over the investigation. Think of your reputation!
816003 My reputation isn't worth much if I won't risk it for what I think is right. Besides, I have a plan.
816000 [door opens]
816000 [door closes]
816000 [door opens]
816000 [cranking sounds]
816000 [door slams]
816000 [door opens]
816000 [bits jingling]
816146 Well, brother of mine, we've got almost all the bits we need to expand our resort. If we add another level of classes and worksheets, we'll be there.
816145 Maybe we should add two levels, just to be safe.
816000 [beep!]
816000 [powering-up sounds]
816000 [water running]
816146 [sighs] It's a thing of beauty. But I was thinking. What if we added another extreme pool slide here?
816145 Mmmm... Sure, as long as the pipes for the musical chocolate fountain go through... here.
816003 But shouldn't it go closer to the pudding hot tub here?
816146 Fair point, but— What?!
816003 I knew your school was a scam!
816146 Well, well, well, if it isn't the Princess of Jealousy. I guess we'll be going to the papers after all.
816003 And I suppose I'll just lead your students into this secret room of bits and resort expansion plans!
816145 Uhhhh... l-let's not get hasty. You have something on us. We have something on you. Let's just call it even.
816003 I don't think so. You can destroy my reputation if you want, but using your students' bits to expand your resort is wrong, even if the lessons you teach are good ones.
816145 Of course they're good. We copied them from your book.
816146 We just skipped every other page. All the lessons, half the time!
816003 [groans] Fine. If you really want to call it even, give back the bits and stop charging for my lessons. Then you can teach them as much as you like.
816147 Nah!
816146 Running a school is more work than we thought. Besides, we almost have everything we need.
816000 [zip!]
81600d I think not!
816145 Plainity? My star pupil?
81600d [affected voice] Not Plainity, but... [normal voice] Rarity!
816000 [beat]
816146 Who?
81600d We decided to bring somepony else here to listen to everything you just said!
816146 [stutters] Hey, Star Swirl. We were just about to—
81643c Return the bits you've collected from your students and close your school?
816145 [gulps] Yeah. That.
816000 [bits jingling]
81643c [sighs] It seems I'll never stop learning from your example, Twilight. It is a valuable lesson to stand up for what you know is true. I wish I had known it, too.
8164a5 Thanks for returning our bits. But how are we going to learn about friendship now?
816000 [disappointed murmuring]
81643c Well, I can refer you to a fairly reputable establishment just outside of Ponyville. I'm quite certain the headmare would consider letting you in.
816003 [giggles]
816000 [students cheering]
816003 [reading] "Of course, if I ever go to a school again, I'll make sure it's yours. In friendship, Star Swirl."
81600d I still don't understand how Flim and Flam could have gotten a copy of your book.
816000 [door opens]
816485 Uh, I finished straightening up in the library. Professor Rarity, I just wanted to make sure you're definitely keeping these.
81600d But of course, darling. If there's one thing I learned at Friendship University, it is not to give up when you know what's right. And I know teaching friendship through sewing is right! I just need to figure out how.
816000 [credits]
817000 [school bell rings]
817000 [door opens]
81727c Oh! Rarity! Just the pony I'm looking for! Can you come to Twilight's class with me? It won't take long.
81700d Oh, I'd love to help, but I have to meet Rainbow Dash for our day of fun together.
81727c Twilight wants to use you as an example for the students.
81700d Ooh!
817000 [door opens]
81700d Your example is here! [laughs] Oh!
81700c I thought I was the example.
817003 You both are. Because together, you perfectly demonstrate my lesson on compromise in friendship. Rainbow Dash and Rarity have very different interests that keep them busy. But being friends is so important to them, they always manage to make time for each other.
81700d [laughs nervously] Our day of fun was hard to plan, what with Rainbow Dash's extremely time-consuming and erratically scheduled Wonderbolts practice.
81700c And Rarity's weird fashion seasons. She's working on her winter collection, and it's not even summer yet!
817003 But you still found time to be together, and that's what counts. See, class? These ponies are models of true friendship in action.
817000 [pencils scribbling]
817003 Thanks for stopping by! Enjoy your day of fun!
817185 Ooh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! What amazing stuff are you gonna do together?!
81700d Rarity:
81700d Shoe shopping!
81700d Dress shopping!
81700d Fabric dyeing!
81700c Rainbow Dash:
81700c Obstacle races!
81700c Buckball!
81700c Flight goggle shopping!
81700c Aw, come on! I even said "shopping" that time!
81700d Perfect! We'll go shopping first.
81700c But I brought stuff for buckball to—
817186 Are we supposed to be learning something here? 'Cause this doesn't sound like compromising at all.
817184 Yeah, you guys have nothing in common. How can you be friends?
817283 [laughing nervously]
817000 [theme song]
817003 Even though Rainbow Dash and Rarity enjoy doing different things, there are plenty of reasons why they're friends.
817187 Uh, like what?
81700c [scoffs] We've always been friends.
817189 Always?
81700c Well, no. Not always. But for like a super long time.
81700d And we know all the same ponies.
817186 Um, is that it?
81700c Uh, there was that time during the Cloudsdale Best Young Flyer Competition that I totally saved Rarity's life.
81700d Yes! And I once proved Rainbow Dash's innocence to her beloved Wonderbolts when she was being framed for a mysterious incident.
817188 Cool! What else?
817050 [laugh nervously]
81727c Uh, look. It may seem like Rarity and Rainbow Dash don't have that much in common when you try to put it into words, but sometimes friendships can't be explained. You just have to see them in action to understand.
817003 Actually, that's a great idea!
817003 Just go about your day of fun as you normally would. You won't even know we're here!
81700c [singsongy] Game on!
817000 [sports theme]
817000 [thwacking]
81700c Rarity! You were supposed to be holding your bucket!
81700d Hmm? Oh! Sorry, darling. Wearing this drab jersey gave me an idea for a buckball-inspired line of "athleisure" wear that would allow for maximum flexibility and style! Uh, but I'm ready now! [blink, blink]
81700c Good! 'Cause this time, I'm gonna try something new and super-intense!
817000 [sports theme continues]
817000 [thwacking]
817000 [whirr!]
817000 [zoom!]
81700c Rarity! Are you even paying attention?!
81700d What? Oh! I mean, of course! Uh, I held my bucket and everything!
81700c But you have to catch the ball!
81700d Really? Well, that sounds dangerous.
81700c [quietly, to herself] Oh, forget it. She's never gonna understand the point of this game. [out loud] Buckball time is over!
81700d [sighs] Finally!
817003 Uhhh, see? They did something Rainbow Dash likes, so now it's time for something Rarity likes. Compromise!
81700d Hmmm... I'm genuinely not sure. Are they too in style?
81700c Uh, isn't that what you want them to be?
81700d Oh, yes, yes. But they should be ahead of the curve. If they're in fashion right now, then they're practically already out.
81700c That doesn't make any sense.
81700d Hmmm... Perhaps I should get the stilettos instead. What do you think?
81700c [scoffs] Unless you like tripping with every step, heels on a horse are pretty useless.
81700d [nickers] Au contraire. They're perfect in a multitude of situations. Formal functions, afternoon teas, evening teas, high tea, tea by the sea, royal tea—
81700c Can they clean up glitter? Ew! It's on my hooves! Are we done yet?! [groans] This is sooooo boring!
817003 Rainbow Dash and Rarity are just, uh, showcasing an aspect of friendship called "banter", the playful and friendly exchange of remarks. [laughs nervously] It's all in good fun.
817000 [pencils scribbling]
81700d Ooh, I cannot wait! Collecting gemstones is my favorite!
81700c Finally, something we can agree on! Treasure hunting!
817283 [laugh, hoof-bump]
817003 See, everycreature? That didn't take long. Now they're having a great time together.
817000 [pencils scribbling]
81700d Ooh! Magnifique! This will be perfect for the emerald-encrusted romper I've been working on!
81700c Cool! Now, what would be even cooler is if we could find a treasure chamber or something! Now, if I were a secret door, where would I be?
817000 [knocking]
817000 [crack]
817000 [thud]
81700d Ugh, Rainbow Dash! Could you please refrain from all of that racket? It's muddying my concentration.
81700c [gasps] Look! A lever! [grunts] It's stuck! Come help me, Rarity!
81700d [sighs] Just a moment.
817000 [thumping]
81700c [grunting]
817000 [crash!]
817000 [shatters]
81700d [gasps] You ruined my gems!
81700c Yeah, well, you ruined my treasure hunt!
81700d Ugh! This wasn't about treasure! It was about finding gemstones for my winter collection!
81700c Who cares about clothes?! We're supposed to be on an adventure together!
817003 Uh-oh.
81700d That... is... it! This "day of fun" is officially over!
81700c Fine by me! Maybe I can spend some time doing something I actually like now!
817183 [gasp]
817003 [laughs nervously] Surely, you don't mean that. You're just having a little disagreement. [to students] Sometimes that happens between pals. But no matter what, they can always get past the problem and stay good friends.
81700c I don't think we can. [to Rarity] You don't care about any of the things I like! It's always about you and your boring fashions!
81700d Oh, puh-lease! You don't even give my interests a chance! You have absolutely no respect for the finer things! No respect, I tell you!
81700d Rarity:
81700d I suppose we're just not friends anymore!
81700c Rainbow Dash:
81700c I guess we're just not friends anymore!
817183 [gasp]
817000 [pencils scribbling]
81700d ...And then there was the time Rainbow Dash called my Cloudsdale Couture Boutique idea "impractical"! Imagine that! Just because I needed Twilight to perform the butterfly wing spell on me whenever I wanted to deliver merchandise!
81700c ...And I told her a thousand times Pegasi don't even want restrictive heavy dresses! We need to be able to fly! Duh!
81700d Not to mention the day I was wearing a really gorgeous hat, and Rainbow Dash didn't even notice!
81700c The Wonderbolts show was ruined! Rarity's hat was blocking everypony's view!
817283 [snarl]
81727c Enough! Guidance counseling is for talking out your problems, not telling me everything that's ever happened in the history of Equestria! [groans] But I've learned sometimes talking isn't enough. You need to put yourselves in one another's shoes.
81700c No way am I wearing those!
81727c [groans] What I'm saying is we need a way to help you two reconnect. Follow me!
817000 [doors open]
81700c The library? And this helps us how?
81727c You both love books. Rainbow Dash never stops talking about Daring Do adventures, and you're a huge fan of Shadow Spade mysteries.
81700d Your point?
81727c The perfect way for you two to reconnect as friends is to read each other's favorite book. I'll read them, too. Then we'll all discuss afterward. It'll be a "Good Friends Book Club". Okay? I'll bring snacks.
81700c Ugh! Fine!
81700d If you insist.
81727c Great! We're all here! To start, why don't you two share one thing you liked about each other's books?
817000 [beat]
81727c Okay. I'll go first. Uh, I really enjoy the part in Daring Do and the Razor of Dreams when Daring used a vicious cragadile as a raft, and then—
81700d [giggles] Please.
81700c Uh, what's so funny?
81700d Oh, sorry. It's just that I find those action sequences so ridiculously over-the-top.
81700c But they're real! You even met Daring Do!
81700d Yes, but the book's descriptions just drag on, and what about those silly unpronounceable names? Doctor whozit-whatsit... [Spanish pronunciation] Caballeron?
81700c Ca-ba-ller-on! Just like it looks! How hard is that?! [snarls]
81727c Uh, tea, anypony? Cucumber sandwich? [laughs nervously] Or we could go over some nice friendly talking points.
81700c [scoffs] Seriously?! Don't even get me started on those clothing descriptions in Shadow Spade! What a yawn fest!
81700d [stutters] But... the outfit descriptions are an integral part of the plot of The Colt in Crimson - A Shadow Spade Mystery!
81700c [insincere yawning]
81700d You see, if you didn't know that Sir Fluffingsworth von Radishfield wears only silk, double-breasted waistcoats, you'd never deduce that he, in fact, was the culprit!
81700c W-Wait. He was?
81700d [gasps] You didn't even read it!
81727c [quietly, to herself] I can see I'm gonna need reinforcements.
817000 [teleportation zap]
81700c Not my fault it's so boring and put me to sleep!
81700d If you can't be bothered to read the thing I like, that just further illustrates the point that we have nothing in common anymore!
8174a6 [collective gasp]
81700c At least we agree on that! From now on, I'm only hanging out with ponies who get me!
8174a6 [deeper collective gasp]
817000 [teleportation zap]
81727c Your drama can wait! Twilight needs help! Now!
817003 [panicking noises]
81727c [panting] Any luck?
817003 No! It's goooone!
81700c What's gone?
817003 The Amulet of Aurora!
81700d [gasps] One of the magical items you've been keeping for Princess Celestia?
817003 That amulet can reverse the tides and summon tsunamis! If it falls into the wrong hooves, Equestria will be in grave danger!
81700c Don't worry, Twilight! I know tons about searching for lost treasure!
81700d And if I follow the culprit's clues, I'm certain I can find who took your amulet!
817003 Thank you! I'll feel so much better knowing you two are looking for it together!
81727c While we work on a locator spell. It's the perfect solution!
817000 [closet doors open]
81700d There appear to be no signs of damage to the surrounding artifacts, suggesting the thief did not leave in a hurry.
817000 [clattering]
81700c Rarity, your boots are leaving sparkles all over the floor!
81700d Pfft! Those aren't from my boots. Mine are magenta, not blue. See?
81700c [gasps]
81700d I mean, really!
817000 [doors open]
81700d [panting] Turns out these boots were not "made for trotting," as advertised. Where are you going?! We promised Twilight we'd work together!
81700c Don't you see? The Amulet of Aurora is made out of Azurantium!
817000 [beat]
81700c Azurantium? You know! The same metal that the Amulet of Atonement from Daring Do book four is made from? It always leaves sparkles wherever it goes. Just like this, remember? It's from the book you just read!
81700d [laughs nervously] That book! Yes! The one I-I just... just read! Ha-ha-ha!
81700c Seriously?! After giving me all that grief, you didn't read mine either?!
81700d Oopsie?
81700c [groans] As soon as we find this amulet, we are done with each other!
81700d Fine by me!
81700d [panting] Ooh! Rainbow Dash, slow down! You're flying past important clues! Look, it's a print. But definitely not a hoof. Are those claw marks?
81700c Who cares? I found a bigger clue!
817000 [geyser spewing]
81700d I hope you don't expect me to... [shudders] ...wade through that.
817000 [submerging]
817000 [plop]
81700c Nah. It's too deep. We'll get stuck.
81700d Ooh. Clever. What Daring Do book did you get that from?
81700c Actually, I learned it at Scootaloo's Filly Guides camp.
81700d [sighs] At least you can fly across.
817000 [geysers spewing]
81700c [gasps, grunts] Nope. If one of those geysers burns off my wing feathers, I'll be out of the Wonderbolts for weeks. [groans] I could...
817000 [construction sounds under]
81700c ...try and slingshot my way through. But I'd need two perfectly placed trees, some stretchy rope, and a pith helmet. [groans] Too bad we can't do what Daring Do did in book four and find a cragadile for a raft.
81700d Ta-daaa! The S.S. Cragadile, at your service!
81700c Uh, that... is... awesome! Uh, I mean, it's all right, I guess.
817000 [dragging sounds]
81700c How did you know how to do that?
81700d Mmm. We may have been friends for a super-long time, but you don't know everything about me yet.
817000 [splashing]
817000 [wings revving]
817000 [geysers spewing]
81700d [gasps] The glitter trail! It's gone!
81700c How are we supposed to find the Amulet of Aurora now?
817000 [leaves rustling]
8174a7 [croaks]
81700d [screams]
8174a7 [quietly] Owww. Ears. Why hoof-hoofs yell? Too, too loud.
81700d [loudly] Sorry! What did you say?!
8174a7 [quietly] Too, too loud.
81700c I think it's a Bufogren. They have really sensitive ears. [whispering loudly] Did you happen to see anycreature with a sparkly thingy go this way?
8174a7 Saw it.
817283 [gagging]
81700c Hold that thought! [gasping]
81700d [coughing]
81700c His breath smells so bad, I can't think! But we can't hear him from back here. Now what?
81700d Hmmm... [sniffs] Aha! I think I have the perfect solution. An old unicorn beauty trick. That is, if you can somehow procure us a tiny bit of cloud?
81700c Now that I can do!
817000 [geyser spewing]
817000 [spinning]
81700d Ooh! It's adorable! [nose pinched] Um, excuse me, kind sir. I have a special treat for you in exchange for your information.
8174a7 Ooh... What's that?
81700d [nose pinched] It is a magical unicorn delicacy called "Effervescence". Very now. Very chic. [yells]
8174a7 Owww!
81700d Sorry, sorry. Enjoy.
8174a7 Mmmmm.... My mouth. Fresh and minty. [nomming]
81700d [sniffs, sighs] Good. Uh, now, which way did the sparkly thing go?
8174a7 Up-up. Up there.
81700d Thank you! [to Rainbow Dash] Well, what are you waiting for? Go on! Fly up there and get that amulet!
81700c Uh, we're doing this together, remember?
81700d But how can we— [screams, panicky noises, panting]
81700c Sorry, but I wasn't leaving you behind in that swamp.
81700d [exhales] Thank you.
817000 [door jiggles]
817000 [knocking]
81700c Huh. Maybe the key to unlocking this thing is in these inscriptions.
81700d Or perhaps the key is right here!
817000 [click]
81700d I couldn't decide between the boots and the stilettos, so I got both!
817000 [lock unlatching]
817000 [door opens]
81700c High heels could do that?
81700d And you called them "useless".
81700c [sighs] I shouldn't have said that. Or made fun of the other stuff you like to do. Some of it's actually sorta neat.
81700d I... owe you an apology, too. Buckball may not be my thing, but it's something you enjoy. And you're very good at it. I never should've treated your interests like they were worth less than mine.
81700c Soooo... does this mean we're still friends?
81700d I would very much like that. Now let's go find that amulet!
81700c Yeah! [laughs]
817000 [door opens]
81700c Wait! That tunnel leads to the... school? A secret passage! Awesome!
81700d [gasps] Spikey-wikey! You stole the Amulet of Aurora?!
817003 Not exactly.
81700d You mean, this was a setup to make us get along?
81727c Sorry to interfere, but you both...
81700c ...reeeeeally needed it.
817283 [laugh]
817186 So even though you don't like any of the same stuff, you two are friends again?
81700d Heh. Always. I think we just needed a teensy reminder.
81700c Yeah. We don't have to love the exact same things to have fun together. I mean, imagine if we did! How boring would that be?
81700d When we give each other a chance to share the different things we enjoy, it can be surprisingly wonderful! [sighs] Too bad we wasted our day of fun.
81700c We still have a little time left. You wanna... go hit the shops? I could actually use your help picking out some new buckball gear.
81700d Do I?! But only if you help me choose some buckball fan attire, so I can cheer for my favorite player at the drop of a fabulous hat!
81700c Uh, yeah! Let's go already!
817283 [laugh, happy chatter]
817003 [to students] See? Good friends always work through their differences.
81727c [laughs] Even if it takes a little help.

818000 [ponies screaming]
8180d4 [scream, groan]
818008 What is that thing?
818003 It's called a yovidaphone. It's from Yakyakistan, where it's actually quite popular.
81800c Is it supposed to sound like that?
818003 Not exactly. It's known to produce a fairly complicated, melodically rich, and harmonious tone.
818000 [bird chirping]
818000 [bird squawks]
818000 [music continues]
81800c Are you sure we're talking about the same thing?
818000 [blare!]
818000 [music ends]
818007 [panting] Phew! And that's with only a few days of practice! Can you believe it?!
818000 [honk!]
81800d Yes. Yes, I can.
818008 I can honestly say I've never heard anything like it in my life.
818007 Well, if you enjoyed listening to my playing half as I enjoyed playing my playing, then I should totally play more! That way, we'll be even!
818003 Oh, I don't think that's necessary, Pinkie.
818025 [agreeing]
81800c Please. Don't.
818007 There's a chance I may have missed a note or two here or there, but I just love playing so much! [sighs] You complete me.
818003 Well, I, for one, am glad you're having so much fun with your new hobby.
818007 [not listening] Uh-huh. Sure.
818003 And it's great that you're learning a new skill, and... and you're just waiting for me to finish talking so you can start playing again, aren't ya?
818007 No! But if you're done... And a-one, and a-two, and a-I know what to do! [inhales deeply]
818000 [dissonant music resumes]
81800e [sighs, to Angel Bunny] It's okay. She's gone.
818008 Anypony else think that sounded like an apple core cut up in a pulp grinder?
81800d Apple-solutely! Uh, absolutely.
818003 Okay, so maybe she isn't good yet. But she's our friend, and we should be supportive.
818008 She just started playin'. She's bound to get better. Right?
81800c Yeah, we just need to be supportive of her practicing... [groans] So the getting-better part happens as fast as possible.
81811a [agreeing]

818005 Especially when you take the library with you.
818003 [chuckles]
818000 [screech]
818008 [burbles, sighs] We need to do somethin' about Pinkie Pie's playin'!
81800c Like, now!
81800e [snoring]
818003 Is it really that bad?
81800c Does this answer your question?
818003 Uh, a trophy?
81800c For second place. Second! Place! All because of Pinkie's playing!
81800d And I wanted to turn heads with my new fall line, but not like this! [sobbing]
818008 And thanks to her fruit-blastin' melodies, I got an orchard full of nothin' but applesauce! And it ain't even saucin' season!
81800d And just look what her playing did to poor Fluttershy!
81800e [snores, gasps] Oh. So very tired. [yawning] It practically took me all night to get the nursery back to sleep. [resumes snoring]
818008 I mean, I know we said we should all be supportive, but Pinkie's been playin' for moons now, and she's not gettin' any better.
81800c Yeah! If anything, she's gotten worse!
818003 Okay, maybe we can just pretend she's really good, and then I'll find a spell that will—
818008 Oh, no, no, no! We're not goin' through that again! Remember how well it worked out when you weren't honest with Celestia about her actin' ability?
818003 [groans] You're right. We'll just have to tell Pinkie Pie she's not very good at the yovidaphone.
818000 [yovidaphone plays]
818000 [ponies screaming]
81800d Well, there's no time like the present.
818000 [music stops]
818007 Phew! Huh, that's weird. I coulda sworn this place was packed a second ago. Hey, guys! Can I favor you all with a tune? I take requests!
818008 Actually, we do have a request, and yeah, it involves your yovidaphone.
818007 You mean the thing I love more than anything else in Equestria? My sun, my moon, my stars, my everything? Ooh! Tell me, tell me, tell me!
818008 All right. In all honesty... Uh, in all honesty... Rarity has somethin' to say!
81800d Pinkie, please listen to Rainbow Dash.
81800c Ugh, fine! So, Pinkie, remember when we all were shocked to discover Princess Celestia wasn't so good at acting?
818007 Yeah, she was awful! But that's kind of a random thing to bring up. I thought you wanted to talk about my yovidaphone playing.
81800c Well, it's, uh... It's just... You need to know, uh... Twilight?
818003 [sighs] Pinkie, we all support you, but we're afraid you're just not good at the yovidaphone, and none of us want you to waste your time on something you can't do well.
818007 Oh. [upbeat] Why didn't you just say so?
818000 [air deflating]
81800c [sighs] We were all really nervous to tell you.
818007 Why? It's just a silly instrument. Well, lunch break's over. Gotta get back to the bakery. Those apple turnovers aren't gonna apple themselves! [whistles gleefully] No more yovidaphone playing for me-e-e!
818000 [door closes]
81800e Wow. She took that so much better than I thought.
818000 [trash can creaking]
818000 [honk!]
818007 [sadly] No more yovidaphone playing for me. And a-one, and a-two, and I don't know what to do. [crying]
818000 [indistinct conversations]
818003 [sighs] Another beautiful day in Ponyville.
818005 Uh, Twilight, when was the last time you saw Pinkie Pie?
818003 Hmmm, not since we told her to stop playing the yovidaphone. I'm still surprised with how well she took it.
818005 I don't think she took it as well as you think she took it.
818022 Top of the morning to ya!
818007 Is it morning? I hadn't noticed.
818003 That's not good.
81800c There you are! We've been looking all over for you!
81800d It turns out Pinkie may not have taken our critique of her yovidaphone playing in the spirit with which it was intended.
818003 I saw.
818000 [shriveling]
818000 [shade closing]
818005 There's gotta be something we can do.
818003 I'm sure there is, Spike. We just have to figure out what.
81800c [sighs] I don't get it. So she's no good at playing the yovidaphone. What's the big deal? There are so many other things she's really good at doing.
818008 Yeah! Not bein' able to play the yovidaphone is nothin' compared to all the things she can do well.
818003 And that's exactly what we'll show her! I bet if we get her to do the stuff she likes and is good at doing, she'll cheer right back up and forget all about the yovidaphone.
818008 Hoo-whee! That's a great idea!
818000 [air squeaks, hisses]
81800d Let's get started. Apparently, there's not a moment to lose.

818000 [mirror shattering]
818053 [sigh]
818003 So, I'm guessing nopony had any success?
818008 [sighs] My party cannon idea was a real dud.
81800c Don't blame yourself. None of us did any better.
818003 Well, not to worry. I came up with the perfect solution. Instead of trying to remind her what she's good at, we'll remind her what she's best at. And that's being our friend. We're gonna throw her a Pinkie Pie Appreciation Party!
81800e That's a wonderful idea! If anypony needs to know how much she's appreciated, it's Pinkie Pie.
81800c We can get the whole town involved, just so she can see what a good friend she is to everypony.
818003 Then I hereby officially declare today Pinkie Pie Appreciation Day!
818025 [cheer]
818000 [various party noises]
81800d Now this is perfection!
81800c Yeah! If anything could help Pinkie Pie cheer up and make her forget about her yovidaphone, this is definitely it!
818008 Sure is! Okay, who's gonna get her?
818003 No need. Gummy's on it. In fact, there he is now!
818000 [dragging noise]
818000 [thump]
818000 [beat]
818008 Uh, Gummy? You were supposed to bring Pinkie Pie. What happened?
8180c6 [blinks slowly]
81800d Is she still coming?
818000 [beat]
818003 Fluttershy, can you understand what he's saying?
81800e I could... if he was talking.
818005 Let me try something. [slowly, loudly, and deliberately] Gummy! Where is Pinkie Pie?!
818000 [splat]
818003 Maybe we should just go and get her.
818000 [magic zap]
818000 [party horn]
818008 What in tarnation is goin' on here?!
81800d This decor is dreadful.
81800c And all of Pinkie's stuff is... gone?!
81800d It is a puzzle.
818242 [deadpan] Excuse me.
81800d Oh, yes, of course.
818003 Um, Maud? Can I ask you a question?
818242 [deadpan] You just did.
818008 Well, can I ask you a question?
818242 [deadpan] You just did.
81800c [groans] Fine! How about if I ask you a— Wait.
81800d Oh, for goodness' sakes! Maud. All of your sister's things are gone. Explain.
818242 [deadpan] No, they're not. They're right here.
81800e Have you seen Pinkie Pie?
818242 Lots of times. I grew up with her.
818000 [cart rumbling]
818003 Okay, let's try this a different way. Why did you pack up all of Pinkie's things?
818242 [deadpan] She asked me to.
818025 What?!
818242 [deadpan] Pinkie told me to pack up her room and take everything to the rock farm.
818025 What?!
818242 [deadpan] She said she wouldn't need them since she's moving to Yakyakistan.
818025 What?!
81800d Terribly sorry, Maud. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said Pinkie's [chuckling] moved to Yakyakistan!
818008 Uh, Rarity? She did say that.
81800d Uh, terribly sorry, Applejack. Must've misheard you. It almost sounded like you said [chuckling] she did say that!
818003 Maud, I don't understand. Why would Pinkie leave Ponyville?
81800c Yeah! Why would she want to go live with the yaks?
818242 [deadpan] She said without the yovidaphone, her life had no meaning, and at least in Yakyakistan, she could listen to the masters play. She hoped that would give her some semblance of happiness.
81800d Well, no! No-no-no-no-no-no-no! That will not do!
818008 I say we go to Yakyakistan right now and make her come back home!
818003 We can't just march up there and tell Pinkie what to do.
81800e [tearing up] But... we didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!
818003 Well, we may not be able to go to Yakyakistan and force her to come home, but we could go say goodbye... and if we happen to mention how much her friendship means to us, and how much we'd miss her if she were gone forever, and then she decided to come back home on her own...
81800c Then what are we waiting around here for?! Let's get going to Yakyakistan!
81811a [cheering]
81811a [various yelps and whoas]
818003 We're almost there.
818008 Pinkie's gotta be around here somewhere.
81800e But where?
818000 [distant yovidaphone playing]
81800d Is that...?
818003 The music of the yovidaphone.
81800c Are you sure? Because that actually sounds kinda... good.
818003 Oh, I'm sure. Come on.
818000 [yovidaphone playing]
81800c Huh. Not what I expected.
8182b6 Shhhh!
81800c Oh, sorry.
8182b6 Shhhhhhh!
81800c [hushed] I said I was sorry!
81800e [hushed, gasps] There she is!
818007 [gulps] [despondent] Gimme another.
8184a8 But pony already had twenty-five ice—
818007 I said, gimme another!
818003 [grunts] Pardon me!
818008 Excuse us.
81800c Oh, uh, sorry!
818007 [despondent] I feel nothing.
818003 Maybe we can help with that.
818007 [despondent] Oh. Hey. What are you guys doing here?
818008 Just hear us out.
81800c We respect your decision to move to Yakyakistan.
818003 But we just wanted to remind you how much you mean to us, and how much we'd miss you if you decided to move here for—
818007 [despondent] Fine. I'll move back to Ponyville.
81800c Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought. We're awesome!
818003 Pinkie, what's wrong?
818007 [despondent] That's what's wrong. I thought coming here and listening to real yovidaphone playing would make me happy.
818000 [yaks applauding]
818007 [despondent] It makes me feel worse. I'm never gonna sound like that.
8184a9 Yovidaphone fan pony watch instrument while Yigrid visit little yak's room?
818007 [despondent] Eh. If I can't play it, I might as well do menial chores for those who can.
818008 Okay, so Pinkie Pie is obviously still miserable.
81800e Oh, I can't bear to see her like this.
818000 [yovidaphone honks]
81800d Indeed. But what else can we do?
818000 [yovidaphone honks]
81800c Yeah, we've tried everything!
81800e Maybe not. Look!
818000 [yovidaphone honking]
818007 [stifled giggling] Whoops! Sorry!
818000 [yovidaphone honking]
818007 I forgot what an awful yovidaphoner I am.
818003 Playing it makes you so happy.
818007 [wistfully] [sighs] It sure does. I mean... it did.
818003 Then you should never stop.
81800d So say we all!
81812c [sounds of agreement]
818008 Absolutely.
818007 But... you were the ones who told me to stop because I wasn't good.
818003 And we were wrong.
81800e Playing makes you happy.
81800d And as long as it makes you happy, it doesn't matter how good you are!
818008 So get up there and show these yaks how it's done!
818007 [stage whisper] I don't know if you've noticed, but the audience are all yaks, and they kind of have "issues" with things that aren't perfect! Like my playing!
81800c Pinkie Pie, you get up on that stage and play. If these yaks don't like it, they'll have to answer to us!
818007 Well, okay... If you all say so...
81800c [clears throat] Ladies and gentleyaks! Performing for her very first time here, let's give a big round of stomps for... Pinkie Pie!
818007 [clears throat] Um, hi! So, uh, any yaks here from out of town?

81800c Me, neither.
8184a9 [stomps] Oh, pony play good set!
818007 You think so? Even though it wasn't perfect?
8184a9 Yovidaphone is instrument of happiness. Playing yovidaphone make pony happy. Pony playing is perfect!
818007 Well if that's the case, lemme play you the song I just wrote two seconds ago! It's called "I've Got the Best Most Supportive Friends a Pony Could Ever Ask For"! [aside] It's a working title.
818003 And a-one...

81927c But if you're there, who's in here?
819000 [poof]
819037 Why, our volunteer, of course!
819009 [coughs] Crabapple surprise! You shoulda oughta tell a pony before ya go a-poofin' 'em around the stage!
819000 [crowd cheers]
819003 Trixie, that was an amazing show!
819198 Flurry Heart and I loved it! I'm so glad we decided to come. You two have a real chemistry.
819037 The Terrifying Trunk Escape does require a grrrreat and powerful assistant.
819198 The way you two work together, it's like you've known each other as long as Twilight and I have.
81927c It was pretty fun.
819003 Of course it was! There's nothing better than a bond with another pony. You can share all kinds of things.
81919d Sunshine, sunshine, ladybugs awake! Clap your hooves and do a little shake! [giggle]
81927c I think we'll stick to the stage magic for now.
819037 The Great and Powerful Trixie doesn't chant.
819000 [theme song]
819037 [sighs] As much as I love my one-pony show, it's always nice to come to Ponyville and perform with my great and powerful assistant. Cadance is right. We do work well together!
81927c Doing a show with you is almost as much fun as counseling students at Twilight's school! [gasps] Which I'm supposed to be doing right now!
819000 [teleportation zap]
81927c See ya later.
819000 [teleportation zap]
819000 [door jiggles]
819000 [thud]
8194aa Excuse me, Ms. Powerful...
819037 [giggles] Usually, ponies just call me Trixie. But "Ms. Powerful" has a nice ring.
8194aa From here to Saddle Arabia, I have seen nothing that compares with your wondrous show. Uh, would you consider blessing my homeland with it?
819037 I was just about to set out on tour. [grunts] But Saddle Arabia is much farther than my usual route. [grunts] Ugh!
819000 [thud]
819037 [laughs] And, uh, my caravan might not be suited for an extended tour.
8194aa Mine is new and quite spacious. If it would help persuade you, I would happily trade it for yours.
819037 Trade it?! Heavens, no! This is more than just some great and powerful wagon you see before you! It is shelter. It is transportation. It is my only friend on the long and lonely nights on the road.
8194aa Very well. Then I must see as many of your performances as I can. If I cannot convince you to bring your tour to Saddle Arabia, I must be prepared to relate its magnificence to your many fans there.
819037 "Many fans", you say? [laughs] Well, I suppose I could consider the trip.
8194aa Wonderful! I look forward to seeing you on the road! And if you change your mind about the caravans, my offer remains open.
819037 Hmmm...
819037 It's just so far away. Of course, I love visiting new and exciting places. I am a traveling magician after all.
81927c Hmmm. Sounds like your mind's made up.
819037 Not quite. The road is a lonely place. And this trip even more so. I was hoping I might convince my grrrrreat and powerful assistant to come along?
81927c Really?
819037 Of course! You're not just my assistant and my counselor. You're also my friend. And what's better than a road trip with friends?
81927c Nothing! This will be the best magical road trip ever!
819000 [doors open]
81927c I should probably get somepony to cover my student counseling duties while we're gone.
819000 [clattering]
819000 [knocking]
81927c Trixie, are you all right?
819000 [door opens]
819037 One caravan for two all set! Oh. You brought luggage. [nervous laugh] I mean, of course you brought luggage!
81927c You bet I did! Everything two ponies need for the road trip of their lives! Three one-thousand-piece puzzles, one copy of Dragon Pit – the best board game in the history of ponies – my famous collection of campfire spices, and an inflatable raft. Did I forget something? I could pop back to the castle and grab it.
819037 Oh, no. It isn't that.
81927c Yeah, maybe we don't need the raft.
819037 [sighs] We just needed a little great and powerful rrrrreorganization! [struggling] Now, everything... fits.. just... fine!
819000 [crash]
819037 [sighs] Who am I kidding? My wagon is too small for us. I understand if you're having second thoughts.
81927c Second thoughts? [scoffs] Are you kidding? This wagon isn't small. It's... eh... cozy. And there's no such thing as too cozy.
819037 Well, all right then! I guess it's time to hit the road! [struggling] I'll... start us off...
819000 [crash]
819000 [door closes]
819000 [rattle]
819000 [poof!]
81927c [coughs] Okay. Maybe there is such a thing as too cozy.
819037 You're sure you wouldn't rather ride?
819000 [rattle]
819000 [poof!]
81927c I'm sure.
819037 And you're not backing out? The two of us sleeping in that cozy caravan could get tricky.
81927c Trixie, there's plenty of high-quality inns to stay at on the way. Don't worry about it. I'm not backing out of the greatest and most powerful road trip bonding experience two ponies could ever have.
819037 Well, when you put it like that, I'm actually kind of excited!
81927c Me, too! [sighs] Thank goodness we're not like Twilight or the others. They'd probably sing a song about it.
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're off on the road to friendship
819000 Our ride might be tiny and small
81927c Beats walking though, eh, Trix?
819037 I am walking.
819037 [Trixie]
819037 But road trips are a great way, we've been told, to get along
81927c [Starlight Glimmer]
81927c I'm glad we're sticking to it, we've already got a song
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're off on the road to friendship
819000 Side by side, just like peas in a pod
819037 [Trixie]
819037 Our bond of friendship is stronger than this tour's demands
8194aa My offer to trade caravans still stands!
81927c Wait, what did he say?
819037 Nothing!
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're so tight, we can't move around
819000 I guess we're stuck together 'cause we're friendship bound
819037 Sure is great traveling with you, buddy!
81927c You too, buddy!
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're off on the road to friendship
819037 Yes, we are!
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We've each got the other to blame
81927c [Starlight Glimmer]
81927c Any trip can be exhausting if you make a fuss
819037 [Trixie]
819037 But we get on so well that's there no way that could be us
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're off on the road to friendship
819000 And there's nowhere that we'd rather be
819037 Was that off-key?
81927c [Starlight Glimmer]
81927c In summer, winter, spring, and fall, we're friends throughout the year
819037 [Trixie]
819037 For untold seasons yet to come, our friendship will be here
81927c For nine, at least!
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're so tight, we can't move around
819037 [quickly] Like a race where you tie your hooves together and you have to move in perfect synchronization to win!
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're friendship boooooound
81927c [quickly] Or like a buddy movie where the two protagonists can't get away from each other because they're wearing hoof-cuffs!
819000 [Starlight Glimmer and Trixie]
819000 We're friendship boooooound!
81932e [laugh]
819037 Ooh, the marketplace. Perfect! I've learned the hard way that life on the road requires very specific supplies. And we only have so many bits. So we'll have to spend them wise...
81927c [chewing]
819037 ...ly.
81927c [sighs] Sorry about wasting bits on street food.
819037 Oh, it's fine. Falafel bonding, right? [laughs] Besides, we still have enough for... haycakes and juice.
81927c Um, why don't we go there?
819037 Oh, no-no-no. I always buy my haycakes here.
81927c So we're just going to wait in line for hours? Uh, which is totally cool! Waiting-in-line bonding! Right?
819037 After our falafel purchase, we weren't able to get everything on my list. But we are definitely set for breakfast.
81927c And I'm sure we'll find out that waiting in that super-long line was worth it.
819037 A few hiccups always happen. We'll be back on the road to friendship after a good night's sleep.
819417 We're all full!
81932e [gasp]
81927c Uh, I'm sure we'll find something.
8194ab Nope.
819000 [door closes]
8194ac Sorry.
819000 [curtain draws]
8194ad All full!
819000 [door closes]
8194aa Ah, the Glowpaz Festival. Somnambula is no doubt filled to the brim. Luckily, travelers such as ourselves have our caravans.
819037 [laughs, to Starlight] You said there'd be plenty of places to stay. "Don't even worry about it," you said. Ya might've thought to make a reservation!
81927c Um, I've been with you singing and standing in line. When would I have done that?
819037 I don't know. But I'm starting to think you aren't as great and powerful an assistant as I thought!
81927c So you just brought me along to do your legwork?
819037 [sighs] No. Of course not. I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated. I was really looking forward to a relaxing night in a nice room.
81927c [sighs] Me, too. But since there's literally no room at the inns, I guess it's lucky we've got the wagon.
81927c [unenthusiastically] Sleeping-in-tight-quarters bonding.
81932e [unenthusiastically] Yaaaaay.
819000 [bumping]
81927c [grunting, groans]
819037 Is there something I can do to make things more comfortable for you?
81927c You could get rid of this junk.
819000 [clattering]
819037 Yes, well, before we throw away the magical items it's taken me years to collect, we could try switching hammocks.
81927c Fine.
819000 [clang]
819000 [birds chirping]
81927c [snoring loudly]
819037 [gasps] Hmm? [whispering] Starlight! Starlight! I think there's a wild animal outside!
819000 [thud]
819037 Starlight?
81927c [continues snoring]
819037 Starlight!
81927c [startled noises] What?
819037 I'm sorry. Your snoring is a bit, um...
81927c Loud? [nervous laugh] Yeah, I do that. I had my village convinced we were being attacked by bears every night.
819000 [beat]
81927c [laughs, clears throat] But we probably need a better solution here.
819037 [sleepily muttering] Ladies and gentleponies... Great and Powerful Trixie... amazing feats...
81927c Seriously?!
819037 [sleepily muttering] Prepare to be amazed...
81927c [munching]
819000 [door opens]
819037 [grumpily] Sleep well?
81927c [grumpily] Sure did.
819037 Is, uh, that the last of the haycakes?
81927c [chomps] Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
819037 It's fine.
819000 [juice pours]
81927c I don't suppose there's any more juice.
819000 [drip]
819037 [glugs] Ahhh! Nah. I guess we'll have to resupply.
819000 [door opens]
8194aa What a glorious morning! I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to the first show of your tour!
81927c Is he gonna be following us for the whole time?!
819037 I do not know.
819000 [crowd murmurs]
81927c [flatly] She's been in there a long time. Do you suppose the Terrifying Trunk Escape is too much for a pony who drinks all the juice and talks non-stop in her sleep?! What if the Great and Powerful Trixie can't...
819000 [poof]
819037 Sleep?! Because her roommate snores like an ursa major?!
819000 [crowd murmuring]
81927c [flatly] But if you're there, who's in here?
819000 [poof]
819416 There's not much room in here!
819037 At least you don't have to sleep in it with another pony!
819000 [fanfare]
8194aa [claps weakly] This show is much better in Ponyville.
819000 [crowd murmuring]
819037 Oh. Would you like the last carrot? I know how fond you are of eating the last of things.
81927c Oh, no. It might make me thirsty, and we don't have anything to drink. So...
819037 The good news is I'm so exhausted, I could sleep through a stampede of wild boars! Which, you'll be delighted to know, is only slightly louder than your snoring.
81927c Well, I'm looking forward to rehearsing the act with you all night. So diligent of you to go over it and over it in your sleep.
819037 [through gritted teeth] Practice makes perfect.
81927c Not today, it didn't.
819037 Well, I'm sorry you're so miserable!
81927c Really?! Because if you wanted to make things more comfortable, you could always pare down a bit!
819000 [poof]
819037 Well, since you're so concerned about space, you can have it all! I'll sleep under the stars, where at least the wild animals will be QUIETER THAN YOU!
819000 [door opens]
8194aa I do not mean to interrupt, but it seems there is trouble on the road to friendship.
81927c [derisive laugh] Ya think?!
819000 [carrot incinerates]
819037 [gasps] Where's my wagon?!
819000 [door opens]
81927c I traded it to that pony from Saddle Arabia for his. He even threw in a pair of robes.
819000 [dramatic sting]
819037 You what?!
81927c I traded the old, worn-out wagon that was too small for us, for this nice spacious one that we can both enjoy.
819037 [stammering] Who said you could do that?!
81927c Nopony. I just did it. [sighs] Now we both have plenty of room, and you didn't even have to give anything away.
819037 Au contraire. I did give something away! I gave away my wagon... and my best friend!
819000 [clatter]
81927c Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't realize you were better friends with that beat-up old wagon than you are with me!
819037 Well, it's easy when the wagon is a better friend! It would've never traded you away!
81927c That's ridiculous.
819037 Oh, it is ridiculous. In fact, this whole tour is ridiculous! I don't even know why I invited you in the first place!
81927c Well, maybe I should just head home!
819037 I think that's a very good idea! And you can take this horrible giant caravan with you!
81927c Fine!
819037 Good!
819000 [dragging]
819000 [thud]
819037 [grunting] Come on! Whoa!
819000 [door jiggles]
8194aa Goodness! Oh, Ms. Powerful. Eh, but where is your assistant? I had hoped providing you with a more comfortable means of conveyance would allow you to once more dazzle the crowds with mystifying feats of magic.
819037 Normally, that sort of flattery would suffice. But today, we must discuss your dishonest and unfair procurement of my wagon!
8194aa I desired your wagon and provided one of equal and better value in return. It seems like a perfectly honest and fair trade to me.
819037 Unfortunately, it is more nuanced than that!
8194aa I'm sure it is, but I am eager to set out. If you'll excuse me.
819000 [whoosh]
8194aa I am willing to wait as long as you are. [sips]
819037 Ha! We'll just see about that!
8194aa You know, even if I was willing to reverse the trade, you don't have my caravan to offer in return.
819037 [grumbles] Details!
819000 [vines snapping]
81927c [sighs, grunts]
819000 [alligator growls]
819000 [teleportation zap]
81927c [struggling] You all seemed... a lot less threatening when there were two of us!
81927c [gasps, yells] This place is awful! How did I not see it before?!
819000 [hawk cries]
8194ae Hey! It's one of those traveling ponies!
8194af Your song really inspired us! We decided we need to head off on the road to friendship, too!
8194ae It sure beats the road to deliveries!
8194af Yeah! Sometimes traveling together is hard!
8194ae You reminded us we could also make it fun! Thanks again! Woo-hoo!
8194b0 [laughing]
819000 [door opens]
8194aa Steaming hot beverage?
819037 Thank you. No.
819000 [rumbling]
81927c What are you two doing?
819037 Taking a stand! By lying down! Not that you care, Wagon-Trader-Away-er!
8194aa I'm afraid I'm still not interested, despite your assistant's convenient appearance.
81927c Trixie, I came back to apologize. I should never have traded away the wagon. It wasn't mine to trade. It belongs to my friend.
8194aa Hmmm. If you truly were friends, I suppose I'd be honor-bound to reverse the trade.
819037 Okay! Fine! We're friends! Best friends who share a deep bond who weren't prepared for the emotional challenges of traveling. Happy?!
8194aa I'm still unconvinced. Perhaps you could prove your friendship.
819037 How?
81927c Uh, we could do our friendship chant!
819000 [beat]
819037 Oh, right... Our world-famous chant of friendship that we do all the time because we're such great friends.
81932e [out of sync] Magic, tra-magic... poof of smoke... want to wave your hooves... and tell a... little joke!
819000 [poof]
8194aa [coughs] That was the worst friendship chant I have ever heard! And you two were clearly making it up as you went. But only true friends would be willing to act so ridiculous for one another.
819037 So you'll give back the wagon?
8194aa Though I'd suggest heading back to Ponyville. I'm not sure Saddle Arabia is ready for... uh, this.
81927c That's fair.
81927c I'm sorry your Saddle Arabian tour was ruined.
819037 Honestly, I don't think I could've stood one more second on the road. At a certain point, I don't even like traveling with myself.
819000 [door opens]
819000 [luggage thuds]
81927c It is a lot harder than I thought. Still, I'm glad we tried. Mostly so we know not to do it again.
81932e [laugh]
819037 I think it's made our friendship greater and more powerful than ever!
819416 [grumbles] You know, there's actually plenty of room in here for one pony to nap. Is the show over?
819000 [credits]
820000 [bang, bang, bang]
820065 Order, order, everypony! I hereby call to order this meeting of the Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
820000 [fans murmuring excitedly]
820065 First order of business – [quickly] Let's-celebrate-the-one-and-only-Rainbow-Dash-yay-she's-amazing-now-if-there's-nothing-else-that-concludes-this-meeting-of-the-Rainbow-Dash-Fan-Club-thank-you-all-for-coming-any-questions?!
820000 [bang]
820000 [confused murmuring]
82000c Huh?
820065 Meeting adjourned!
820000 [door slams]
820000 [bang, bang]
820065 I'd like to call to order the first ever meeting of the newest and most exciting club – of which I am the president, founding, and only member – the Washouts Fan Club!
82000c [gasps]
820000 [theme song]
820000 [door opens]
82000c Oh, hey, Scootaloo. I was just in the neighbor— Oh! What's this? Did I interrupt your fan club meeting?
820065 Hey! What are you doin' here?
82000c I could ask you the same question!
820065 Oh, uh, y'know... mmm... s-s-stuff. Uh, definitely not starting a new fan club or anything.
82000c Ha! It's no use pretending! I heard everything when I was outside eavesdropping, like I do for every meeting!
820065 You eavesdrop on every meeting? That's weird.
82000c Well, sure it sounds weird when you say it out loud. And I probably shouldn't because eavesdropping is wrong, but still. Why are you starting a new fan club?
820065 I just think maybe it's time for me to explore other fan clubs.
82000c [gasps] What is a "The Washouts"?
820065 Only the newest, and greatest, and only stunt troupe in Equestria!
82000c Stunt troupe?
820065 How can I explain it? Like the Wonderbolts, just twenty bajillion percent cooler! [squee]
82000c "Twenty bajillion"?!
820065 They do all sorts of extreme stunts that focus on daredevilry and sheer guts rather than boring old flight and formation junk.
82000c "Boring old flight and formation junk"?!
820065 Are you just repeating everything I say?
82000c Only because my brain feels like it's strapped to one of those rockets about to explode.
820065 So you do get it! Aren't they awesome?!
82000c Can you believe she actually said that?!
820007 Pfft, well, yeah! Eavesdropping on every meeting is kinda weird.
82000c I mean, she basically said that the Wonderbolts aren't cool! And... And it kinda sounded like she didn't think I was cool either. But, peh, we all know that's crazy! I mean, I'm definitely not worried about her looking up to somepony else. Heh. Nope. Not! At! All!
820008 Well, I'd understand if you were. It'd be like if Apple Bloom started lovin' bananas more than apples. [laughs, sotto voce] Y'all tell me if that ever happens, ya hear?
82000c But what could the Washouts possibly have that I don't?!
820007 Why don't you find out?
82000c They're doing a show in Ponyville this weekend?!
820003 Wow! They do look pretty amazing... uh, -ly unamazing. [nervous laugh] Trying so hard to look amazing is what I mean.
820007 Nice save, Twilight! [squee]
820000 [crowd chattering]
820065 Awww. I knew we shoulda lined up last night.
820007 I'm sorry for making us late. Who would've guessed Xtreme Chocolate Airshow Cupcakes would take an x-tremely long time to bake? [slurps, chomps]
82000c Look at this! It's a total Wonderbolts ripoff!
820065 What do you mean? The show hasn't even started yet.
82000c Yeah, but look at what we're sitting on.
820000 [bang, bang]
82000c Hello?! The Wonderbolts have bleachers, too! We practically invented sitting on bleachers!
82000d Ugh!
82000c And look at that! Popcorn and cotton candy?! Ripoff!
820000 [feedback]
820000 [music]
820065 Huh? Yeeeeeeeaaaahhh!
820124 This is the time! This is the place! This is the team! This is... the Washouts!
820000 [crowd cheers]
820000 [explosions]
820007 Mmmm! Quality confetti cannon work.
82000c [sighs]
820065 Oh, yeah!
820124 Say it with me now, the Washouts' official motto...
8204b1 Leap before you look!
820000 [crowd cheers]
820065 Woo-hoo!
82000c Lame.
8204b2 Oh!
820124 Remember, ponies. While they're amazingly awesome, the Washouts are highly trained professionals in protective fire-proof flight suits! Do NOT try this at home!
820000 [kaboom!]
82000c Whoa. Come on, come on! She's not gonna make it!
820000 [clang!]
820000 [crowd gasps]
820000 [crowd cheers]
82000c That... was... insane! Woo-hoo!
820065 I told you!
82000c I mean... [clears throat] It was pretty cool. Who are these guys?
820065 I can't just go up and talk to them.
82000c You can if you're with me. After all, one of the reasons there's a Rainbow Dash fan club is because I'm fearless. Observe.
820000 [water splashing]
82000c Hey!
820000 [beat]
82000c Uh, so as a fellow aerobatic professional, I really enjoyed your show. Heh. Actually, you might recognize me since I'm a... pause for dramatic effect... a Wonderbolt.
8204b3 [laugh]
8204b4 [Australian accent] Ha! Join the club.
820065 [excited noises]
82000c O... kay...
8204b4 No. I mean, literally. Join the club. We're called "The Washouts" because we all used to be Wonderbolts just like you. Heh. Until we "washed out".
82000c No way!
8204b4 Yep. [sighs] Name's Rolling Thunder. I got booted out of Wonderbolt Academy because of "flagrant disregard for hazardous weather". Pfft! If doing barrel rolls through nine hundred million volts of electricity in a raging thunderstorm is wrong, then I don't wanna be right.
82000c Cool!
8204b4 Ha. This 'ere's Short Fuse.
8204b5 Ah, nice to meet you.
82000c What's your story?
8204b5 ANGER ISSUES! GET OFF MY BACK!
82000c Uhhh... Okay. So, who's the leader?
8204b4 Only the most reckless ex-Wonderbolt of all time.
82000c [gasps] Lightning Dust!
8201d6 Rainbow Dash!
82000c [snarls]
820065 Scootaloo. I'm Scootaloo. Hi.
82000c Lightning Dust! I should've known you were the brains behind a crazy idea like the Washouts! Or should I say, "lack of brains"!
8201d6 [snarls]
820065 You two really know each other? Oh, my gosh! This is so cool!
8201d6 Your "friend" got me kicked out of the Wonderbolts.
820065 Oh. That's, uh, less cool.
8201d6 And it was the best thing that ever happened to me! Great to see you, wingpony! I heard you're a full-fledged Bolt now.
82000c Yeah, well, I'm still—
8201d6 Mad at me? Look, was it wrong of me to endanger the lives of your friends? Yeah. But, hey, now I only endanger these knuckleheads.
8204b3 [laugh]
8204b5 [through gritted teeth] Don't call me "Knucklehead"! [laughs]
8201d6 C'mon, you know you miss me. Me and her, we blew everypony out of the sky.
820065 Really?
8201d6 Actually, yeah, really! All that wind was totally dangerous, but we had fun, right? Two fastest times on the Dizzitron!
82000c If I remember correctly, I had you beat by half a second.
8201d6 Only because when I went, I cranked up the dizziness factor.
8201d9 [laugh]
82000c Well, I'm glad it all worked out. Your show was pretty dynamite.
8201d6 [to Scootaloo] Wanna know the secret? We basically ignore everything the Wonderbolts ever taught us about safety.
82000c Well, we do have safety rules for a reason.
8201d6 Don't listen to her, kid. All their "rules" were just ways of keeping their little club exclusive so they could feel good about themselves.
82000c It's not about making anypony feel bad. It's about finding the best flyers. The best of the best.
8201d6 I started the Washouts because I believe anypony can be the best of the best. You know, Rolling Thunder is gonna be out for a while.
8204b4 Ah, during the finale, I caught the old hind leg in the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot! Patent pending.
8201d6 There's a spot on the team if you wanna join up.
820065 [gasps]
82000c I appreciate the offer, but I'm already a Wonderbolt.
820065 I'll do it! Can I do it?!
82000c Uh, lemme think. No!
820065 [scoffs] I wasn't asking you!
8201d6 Awww, you're cute. But technically, you haven't washed out of the Bolts, which is kinda our thing.
82000c And also, no!
820065 Oh, what if I joined and dropped out super quick?!
82000c That's it! You're comin' with me!
820065 Where are we going?
82000c To hear what the actual Wonderbolts think about you joining just to drop out for the Washouts!
8201d6 Say hi to Spitfire for me!
820000 [Wonderbolts theme]
820065 [yawns]
82000c Ever seen two simultaneous inverse displacement rolls before?
820065 [scoffs] Would've been a lot cooler if you had the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot, patent pending.
82000c You... What?! [to Spitfire] See? This is what I was telling you about.
82007c I got this. [to Scootaloo] You know what happens when something goes wrong with the Crushinator Jaws of Smashalot?
82000c Patent pending?
82007c You end up in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
820065 But with enough practice—
82007c Practice?! Well, la-dee-doodle-dah! Lemme give you a different scenario. You're probably saying to yourself, "I'm young. I'm strong. I'm gonna go out there and stunt some tricks with my new friend Lightning Dust!" Well, I'm here to tell ya that if ya play that game, you're gonna find out it's pretty hard to "stunt tricks" in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
82000c I think she gets the poi—
82007c I'm not finished! Listen, I get it, kid. I used to be like you, tellin' myself, "I'm gonna touch the sky!"
820065 I don't—
82007c Well, whoop-dee-doodle-doo! You think you got it made in the shade? Well, things are gonna be pretty shady indeed when you can't go out in the sun, 'cause you're in a full body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw! Do I make myself clear?!
820065 [shakily] Uh-huh...
82007c Excellent. Have a hat.
82000c Uh... Heh. Sorry that was a little... intense. I just wanna make sure you don't get hurt. That way, you can follow in my hoofsteps. Heh. Everypony's dream, right?
820065 More like "follow your wingflaps".
82000c Same difference.
820065 [sarcastically] Thanks, super-talented flyer, for clearing up what I should do.
82000c Clearing things up is one of my specialties. Now, come on. Let's go rip up all your Washout posters into tiny pieces and throw 'em off a cliff.
82000c I just thought of a great way to raise awareness for your original fan club. You know, the one about me?
820000 [clatter]
82000c How about a silent auction where every item is just a picture of yours truly? [laughs] Nah! I'm just kidding.
820000 [blow dryer blowing]
82000c That makes me seem too egotistical, doesn't it? Oh, oh! Maybe if they're framed, it's like, "Wow, she's so humble!" Ya think? Scootaloo?
820000 [door opens]
82000c Uh, Scootaloo?
82000c Anypony seen Scootalo—
820000 [bump!]
82000c Ow! My fault, my fault! Sorry, I— Twilight?
820003 [groans] Sorry. I was just... um...
82000c Please tell me you got that stuff so you could rip it up and throw it off a cliff.
820003 They were doing an autograph session before practice.
82000c Seriously?! [groans] You haven't seen Scoot, have you?
820003 Actually...
82000c I can't believe Scootaloo ditched me to watch them practice! Why can't she see how dangerous they are?!
820003 That's kind of the whole draw. It's exciting.
82000c But it's like the harder I try to convince Scoot they're dangerous, the more she likes them!
820003 You can't control her actions. Only yours. Teach her what's safe and what isn't, like a good role model. Then hope she makes the right decisions.
82000c But what if she chooses them over me? She's gonna get hurt!
820003 I think I know somepony else who might get hurt if that happens.
82000c Um, maybe you're right. But this isn't about me. I'm just worried about Scoot.
820000 [clanging]
8204b5 Wow. You're really workin' hard on this new stunt. [chomps, spits] What kind of sorry excuse for a tomato sandwich is this?!
8201d6 Sorry, Dash. Autograph session's over. Unless you wanna buy Short Fuse's limited edition half-eaten tomato sandwich.
8204b5 I'm not signing that abomination!
82000c You haven't seen Scootaloo, have you?
8201d6 Ohhhh, isn't she that pony that used to respect you?
82000c [growls] I'd appreciate you helping me find her so I could apologize for trying to make her quit liking you.
8201d6 [laughs] Oh, I'm pretty sure she still likes us.
82000c [gasps]
82000c Lightning Dust, I know we go way back, but I can't let her do this!
820065 I don't need you standing up for me!
82000c Obviously, you do! Because you can't see how dangerous this is! Do you not remember what Spitfire said?
8201d6 Ugh. Lemme guess. [imitating Spitfire] You'll be in a full-body wing-and-hoof cast drinkin' through a straw!
82000c That doesn't even sound like Spitfire.
820065 [laughing]
82000c That's it! We're leaving!
820065 Just because I look up to you doesn't mean I have to be you! But based on your definition of what makes somepony great, I have bad news. I'll never be the best of the best or a Wonderbolt! Because I! Can't! Fly! Is that what you wanted to hear? But not being able to fly doesn't mean I can't do something awesome! Like strapping my scooter to a multi-stage liquid-fueled rocket and jumping twenty-two wagons lined up in front of a roaring crowd!
820003 That was awfully specific.
8201d6 That's 'cause it's what she'll be doing in the show tonight. Half off for princesses! [whispering] Bring your friends!
820003 Scootaloo, are you sure that's what you really wanna do?
820065 Absolutely. [to Rainbow] And there's nothing you can do to stop me!
82000c You're right. You're your own foal, and you have to make your own decisions.
820065 Good! Because I already have!
82000c [sighs]
820000 [crowd chattering]
820007 Sorry for making us late again. Who would've guessed Scootaloo's super-difficult stunt special cupcakes would've been super-difficult to bake? [chomps]
820008 Hoo-wee! Looks like all of Ponyville is here. Except for Rainbow Dash.
820003 [sighs]
820124 And here to introduce the most dangerous stunt we've ever performed, it's your fearless captain, L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Lightning Dust!
820000 [crowd cheers]
8201d6 In just a moment, the newest member of the Washouts will be rocket-sledding down that hill, up that ramp, and over all twenty-two wagons to land on the other side in one piece! Heh. If she's lucky.
820000 [crowd gasps]
8201d6 Put your hooves together for Half-Pint Dynamite!
820000 [crowd cheers]
820065 Lightning Dust, I have to tell you. I actually started Equestria's first Washouts fan club! As far as I know. So this is a real honor, ma'am! Uh, do I call you "ma'am"?
8201d6 You land this jump, you can call me whatever you want.
820065 Wow. That sure is...
8201d6 Dangerous? Nah! Well, maybe a little.
820065 Has anypony tested it before?
8201d6 Where's the fun in that?
820065 [gulps]
820000 [tape stretching]
820065 There's m-more?!
8201d6 You're not thinking of backing out, are you?
820065 No! I'm just thinking about drinking through straws.
8201d6 Are you the president of my fan club or not?
820065 Of course! It's just—
8201d6 You wouldn't wanna get impeached for dishonoring my wishes, would you?
820065 I... Is that a thing?
8201d6 Light it up!
820000 [flames roaring]
820065 Okay. Now I am thinking about backing out.
8201d6 Too late!
820000 [rockets roaring]
820000 [crowd cheering]
820065 [whimpering]
820000 [crowd gasps]
820000 [whoosh!]
82000c I know I was supposed to let you make your own decisions, but that doesn't mean I can't swoop in and save you from time to time.
8201d6 If I'd known you were gonna bail, I would've done the trick myself!
82000c Great! So you won't mind how that rope's about to coil around your hoof.
820000 [snap!]
8201d6 RIVALS FOR LIIIIIFE!
82000c Wouldn't have it any other way!
820065 I'm sorry for joining the Washouts. Lightning Dust wasn't who I thought she was. She didn't care about me being scared or putting me in danger. She only wanted a good show, even if it meant I got hurt. That's not the kind of pony I wanna look up to.
82000c I'm the one who should be apologizing for not acting like somepony who deserves a fan club. I've been lucky enough to have somepony who thinks I'm the coolest. But there's nothing cool about making you feel like you'll never be as awesome as me. I think we should cancel the Washouts Fan Club. Because I know a fan club that could use some new members.
820065 The Rainbow Dash Fan Club!
820000 [bang, bang, bang]
82000c [clears throat] Welcome to the first ever meeting of the newest fan club for the awesomest, previously under-appreciated pony in Ponyville! With founding member and president Rainbow Dash presiding, it's the... Scootaloo Fan Club!
820000 [fans cheering]
820065 You know, Rainbow Dash was right. Eavesdropping on your own fan club isn't weird at all.
820000 [credits]
821000 [digging sounds]
821000 [clunk!]
8213fe [grunting and laughing] You're going to have to work faster than that if you plan to dig up my whole village, lass. Let me help.
82143e [yelps]
821000 [thud!]
82143e Er... Thank you, Rockhoof, but we're trying to carefully preserve every bit of history here.
8213fe Aye. This place is full of memories. Did I tell you about the time our chieftain knocked down five boulders with the kick of a wee ball?
82143e [gasps] Stop that!
821000 [ball thunks]
8213fe But... [stutters] That's what this is for.
82143e Maybe in the past. [blows] Now it belongs in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched.
8213fe Agh! Next you'll be sayin' I shouldn't have used the old sweat lodge.
82143e [gasps]
821000 [crash!]
82143e So, you see why Rockhoof isn't an ideal fit for my team. Perhaps you could use his, uh... unusual talents?
821003 Of course, Professor Fossil! We'd be honored to have a Pillar of Equestria on our staff!
82143e Oh, thank Celestia.
821000 [door closes]
8213fe [slurps, crunch] Ugh! [spits, groans] That apple's made of wood! What a horrible trick to play!
821000 [whack!]
82100d Hmm. Has anypony seen my decorative centerpieces? They were right here.
82143e Good luck!
821000 [theme song]
821000 [students chattering]
821003 So, join me in welcoming Professor Rockhoof to our faculty!
821000 [students cheering]
8213fe Thank you! Thank you, all! I know I'm new to your world, but there's one thing I learned when I saved my village from a rushing river of hot lava. There's nothing you can't do with hard work. And a shovel!
821000 [crunch!]
821000 [students gasping]
821000 [creaking]
821000 [crash!]
821186 Except maybe stand on stage.
821005 [grunting]
821003 So, um... everycreature dismissed. We'll... see you in class!
821000 [students chattering]
821186 You think that new pony is gonna be the weirdest teacher at school or just one of the weirdest?
821187 Yona like new teacher. He big like yak!
821184 And he smashes things like a yak, smells like a yak...
821187 Yes! He perfect!
821188 Guys, he's one of the Pillars! He's like... pony history!
8213fe Hello, class!
821000 [crash!]
8213fe Eh, um... [clears throat] I'm, uh, your new "Theory and Defense of Friendship" teacher.
821000 [creaking]
8213fe But, uh, I haven't had a chance to look at Headmare Twilight's notes yet. What have you all been learnin'?
821189 We just studied all about how Princess Celestia and Luna used a spell to trap Discord in stone sleep for hundreds of moons.
8213fe Ohhhh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! So it's a class about stories, is it?
821184 Stories! Yeah! And we never, ever, ever get homework!
8213fe Good! The best way to teach colts and fillies is by experience. Like the time I was in the woods and I ran across an ursa major!
821185 Really?!
821188 We're not doing that, right?
821187 You fight ursa major? All alone?
8213fe Aye. And I defeated her, too.
821186 Now this I'm interested in!
821187 How Professor Rockhoof win?
8213fe Well... that's quite a tale.
821003 From what Professor Fossil said, it sounds like Rockhoof just hasn't settled into modern times yet. Our school is the perfect place for that. Plus, we get a new teacher.
821008 [chuckles] This may be the fastest friendship problem you ever solved.
821000 [crash!]
8213fe Dodge! Thrust! Shovel leap! Shovel throw!
821000 [crunch!]
821000 [thud!]
8213fe Shovel whack! Now you lot be the ursa major. Lots o' growlin', mind?
8214b6 [growling]
8213fe [laughing]
821000 [thunk!]
821000 [students cheering]
821008 Maybe classrooms were less breakable in the old days?
821187 Ooh-ooh-ooh! What happened next?
8213fe [laughing] The huge beastie jumped out of the moonlit mist, her fearsome fangs at my throat! But I rolled clear.
821000 [crash!]
821185 Then what?
8213fe She backed me up against a wall, ready to pounce!
821000 [students gasping]
8213fe I looked at her. She looked at me. And I say—!
821003 Uh, Professor Rockhoof?
8213fe Nope! Guess again! [clears throat] Uh, oops.
821003 Sorry to interrupt. Class, why don't we go ahead and take lunch early today? Rockhoof, can we take a walk outside?
821000 [students chattering]
821003 Our school is about finding your own special way to teach.
821008 And we can already tell you're a... smash with the class. [chuckles]
821003 But maybe you could do a little less smashing in the classroom?
8213fe Sorry about that. I did get a bit carried away. The students were so interested in my tale. [grunting]
821003 I know it's a big change. But I think you're gonna fit in just—
821000 [flames roaring]
821000 [boom!]
8213fe Fire!
821003 Rockhoof, wait!
8213fe No time! The building's ablaze! We have to get everypony out!
821187 Professor Rockhoof best teacher ever! [sighs] Day cannot get better.
821000 [crash!]
8213fe Let's get you outside, wee ones!
821187 Day just got better!
8213fe [grunts]
821185 [yelps]
8213fe Alley-oop!
821008 Rockhoof?
821003 What are you doing?!
8213fe Savin' the school!
821000 [shatter!]
821000 [water splashing]
8213fe Just like fightin' a volcano in the good old days!
82100d Would somepony kindly explain what is the meaning of all this water?!
821007 I'm not sure. But I think it's surf's up! Woo-hoo! Cowabunga!
8213fe Sorry, Rarity, but I had to put out the ragin' inferno.
821005 Inferno? Where?
8213fe Did you not see the smoke and flame?
821186 Yeah, that was us. You know, dragons? Having a fire-breathing competition?
8213fe You, uh... what?
821003 [panting] They do it all the time. That's what we were trying to tell you.
821008 We know you're used to bein' a hero, Rockhoof. Only what we need here is a teacher.
82100d One who doesn't ruin an entire class's friendship quilts. Do you know how hard it is to stitch a pineapple pattern?!
8213fe [sighs] My deepest apologies. I'm not used to living with dragons or much else in this modern time. Professor Fossil made it clear I'm not welcome back in my old village. Seems I don't belong here either.
821007 Wheeeee!
821003 So apparently, finding Rockhoof a new job is a lot harder than we thought. Has anypony had any luck?
821025 [negative muttering]
821008 I-I thought you were gonna try him out at the post office.
821003 We did.
8213fe [yelling] Do you know where I can find Cranky Doodle Donkey?! I need to deliver his medicine! He has a rash in a very embarrassing place!
821005 [shudders] I did not need to hear that.
82100d Yup. Rockhoof's time as a spa masseuse didn't work out either.
8213fe Now just let me know if this is too much pressure!
821000 [crunch!]
82117b [high-pitched shriek]
82100c W-Well, at least Rockhoof's really strong. Maybe we could find him a job carrying heavy stuff?
821007 I tried that already. Zecora needed somepony to help her get supplies, but...
821000 [knock, knock]
821000 [door opens]
8213fe I know you said you only needed a few leaves, but I figured why not bring you the whole thing?
821000 [bees buzzing]
82100d Oh, how horrid.
82100e None of the other Pillars seem to be having trouble fitting into the modern world.
821008 Then maybe they can show Rockhoof how they did it. Get him used to livin' in this time.
821003 Great idea! Rockhoof's old friends would be happy to help. And I bet he'd love to visit them.
8213fe [sighs] Even Canterlot looks different from the old days.
821008 Aww. I'm sure once you see your old pal Flash Magnus, you'll feel right at home.
821406 Trot, two, three, four! Trot, two, three, four! Keep it lively, rookies! Visitors on site! Company, halt! Rockhoof, you old ditch-digger you!
8213fe Flash Magnus, as I live and breathe! Is this your squadron?
821406 After we got out of limbo, I went looking for work for a pony with experience in the Royal Legion. Once a soldier, always a soldier.
821003 Princess Celestia was happy to find a new drill sergeant for her guard!
8213fe Uh... that's great. She really put you in a job that big so soon?
821406 Ho-ho, this is nothing. You should see what Mistmane is up to.
821000 [shimmering sounds]
8213fe They made you the royal landscape artist for the Crystal Empire?
821008 Wow...
821003 Your work is beautiful.
821402 Oh, thank you. I've never worked with crystal before, but in my heart, I know I'm where I belong.
8213fe You always could find the beauty in things. But there's not much demand for shovel ponies like me nowadays.
821402 Don't give up hope. See Somnambula. She'll help you find your purpose.
821003 [whispering] Somnambula's a motivational speaker. Bet they didn't even have those back in your time.
8213fe [whispering] Because we didn't need them. Ponies knew what to do with their lives.
821443 Focus on my voice and feel yourself unlock your potential. [inhaling and exhaling] Imagine everything that troubles you as one big cloud. Now let it float away. You are relaxed. Free to do anything you wish.
8213fe [snoring loudly]
821008 Guess he wished he could take a nap?
8213fe Mage Meadowbrook, your home looks just the same as the old days. Wish I could say the same for mine.
821423 Well, I've had to expand my clinic a bit. Many creatures need healin' in this modern world. Aww. Looks like you could use some, too. What's got you heartsick, Rockhoof?
821000 [thud!]
821000 [bottles clattering]
8213fe Thing is, I can't do my old job like Flash. Or adapt like Mistmane. Or succeed at something new like Somnambula. Or go home, like you.
821423 Give it time. Even Star Swirl's still learnin' about friendship.
821008 Yeah! And I bet Stygian took plenty o' time to fit in.
821003 Hey, look what I found! Me and My Shadow, the third hit novel by former villain Stygian! I'm impressed! He's really thriving!
8213fe [sighs]
821003 Rockhoof? Where are you going?
8213fe I'm not sure. Maybe I just don't belong in this modern world.
821008 Now this here's a right mash of apples. 'Stead of solvin' Rockhoof's problem, we made him feel even worse.
82100c I'll tell you the real problem here. We haven't given Rockhoof the chance to be who he really is.
821007 A pony with a metal shovel and a heart of gold?
82100c Ugh. A hero! What we need to do is find him a job that's as epic as he is!
821003 Hmm. I might know just the thing.
8213fe I'm honored to serve in the Hippogriff Navy, General Seaspray! I promise I'll prove my worth.
821448 Think nothing of it. I know how hard it is to adapt to a new home. After our many years below the waves, land customs seemed strange.
8213fe Like you didn't fit in, no matter how hard you tried?
821448 As though the world had moved on without us. Never fear, Rockhoof. We shall be as brothers in this bright future above the waves.
821008 [whispering, to Twilight Sparkle] Uh, why do the Hippogriffs need ships if they can turn into seaponies?
821003 Maybe they just like cruises?
8214b7 General! The fog's too thick to see our way out of the harbor!
821000 [water rushing]
821448 Heave to, swabbies! Halt the ship and hold her 'til the fog passes!
8213fe Wait, General! We can navigate the same way my Coltic ancestors traveled through the Selkie Mists! We'll look to the stars! There in the northwest sky is the constellation O'Bridle's Pelt! Steer the ship toward that!
821448 You heard the pony, crew! Make full sail!
821000 [water rushing]
821008 Yee-haw! Rockhoof did it!
821000 [crash!]
8213fe But... I don't understand! The stars have always steered me true!
821003 Oh, no. Stars can move slowly over time. They must look different now than over a thousand years ago.
821448 It was an honor serving with you, Rockhoof. But it seems our paths lie in different directions.
821003 Hey, mistakes happen. We'll think of something else for you to do.
8213fe Oh, there's no need, lass. I already know what I want to do next.
821008 Really? What?
8213fe I heard there's a statue spell that sends creatures into stone sleep. I want you to cast it. On me.
821003 [gasps]
821005 [muttering sleepily]
821003 No!
8213fe Yes!
821003 No!
8213fe Aye!
821005 [groans]
821003 No!
8213fe Aye!
821000 [door opens]
821005 Hey, guys. Need me to help you decide something?
821003 Rockhoof wants me to cast a spell to turn him into a statue! The answer is no!
8213fe Well, it should be "aye", because I wouldn't even be here to be turned into a statue if Twilight hadn't cast a spell in the first place! [stomps]
821005 Whoa. I thought you were arguing over ice cream flavors.
821003 The answer is still no! Why would you want to be turned into stone?
8213fe Because I'm a relic of a bygone age. I belong in a museum. Safe. Preserved. Untouched. I don't belong in this time. It's up to you to make that right.
821003 But there has to be a better way!
8213fe Twilight, please understand. I want to be remembered as the hero I was, not the disappointment I've become.
821003 But you're not! Rockhoof, wait! Spike, can you teach my class today?
821005 Uh, you're not really going to turn him to stone, are you?
821003 Only because it's temporary. As soon as I think of a new solution, we'll wake Rockhoof up. I know he has more to offer the world as a pony than a statue.
821188 Did you hear Rockhoof caught all the bees in the Everfree Forest and gave 'em to Zecora as a gift?
821185 Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof called down the stars and sunk the whole Hippogriff Navy!
821186 He's definitely weird, but in a fun way. You never know what's gonna happen next with him.
821187 Professor Rockhoof best pony!
821005 Hey, class. Welcome to the Theory and Defense of Friendship.
821184 Another sub? Let me start by telling you we don't get homework and we only do field trips.
821005 Yeeeeah. Nice try. Twilight sent me to tell you she won't be in today 'cause she has to cast a stone sleep spell on Rockhoof.
821000 [students gasp]
821189 Like Discord?! But why?! Rockhoof isn't a bad guy!
821005 ["I don't know" sound] Your instructions are to write an essay on heroism and what it means to you.
821187 No!
821005 Oh, don't worry. It doesn't have to be a long essay.
8213fe Maybe like this? Or on three legs? Hmm. What will give the wee birds fewer places to, uh... decorate?
821187 Professor Rockhoof! Dragon said you want to turn into stone! Yona not believe it!
8213fe Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass.
821187 But... pony need finish ursa major story for class!
8213fe Oh, it's sweet of you to try to get me to stay, Yona. But I'm afraid old stories like mine aren't worth anything in this day and age.
821187 Fine! If pony no want tell Yona story, then Yona tell pony story! From class report! [reading] "When Yona come to pony school, Yona not fit in. Pony ways strange. But Yona find friends! Yona meet Professor Rockhoof! Pony brave and strong as yak! Not afraid! Hero! When Yona grow up, Yona want to be just like Professor Rockhoof!"
8213fe Well, uh, since you went to the trouble of writing something that nice, I suppose the least I could do is tell you the rest of the story.
821187 Yona tell whole school Rockhoof is best! Now all want to hear story!
821000 [doors open]
821003 Okay, I have the spell. But will you please reconsider? Rockhoof?
8213fe The ursa major tried to grab me by the gullet! But I ducked her claws!
821000 [students in awe]
8213fe She had me cornered. So I look at her. She looks at me.
82100e [gasps]
8213fe And I say, "Sorry you won't be having any dinner tonight, lass! Guess you'll just have to... grin and bear it!"
821000 [students laughing]
8213fe And then I tossed her away with my shovel high into the sky! And she's been a constellation up there ever since! Or so I'm told. And that's the end of my story.
821183 One more story! One more story!
8213fe No, no. Thank you for listening. But it's time to say goodbye.
821003 Wait. You said there wasn't anything in this time you were good at. What about telling stories?
8213fe It was just a tall tale.
821003 One that captured the hearts and imagination of everycreature here.
821187 Plus, pony story super fun!
821000 [students cheering]
821003 As the Princess of Friendship, I'd like to appoint you as Equestria's official keeper of tales!
821005 Can you do that?
821003 Eh.
8213fe I, uh... That's very kind of you. But I still think these old bones are more suited to a museum display.
821003 You are a living record of our history. Your stories can inspire and teach generations to come. If you're a statue, that's all lost.
8213fe But will I ever really belong in your world?
821187 Rockhoof Yona's friend. So Rockhoof belongs!
8213fe You know... That reminds me of another story. Once, there was a small yak that knew more than a great hero.
821186 Hey, don't forget the dragons in this one!
8213fe Aye, there were dragons. And ponies. And plenty of Hippogriffs. Plus a changeling and a griffon...
821000 [credits]
822003 The Tree of Harmony remains one of the most powerful sources of magic known to ponydom. And though it has been at the "root" of magic and friendship from the moment it was planted, its ways are mysterious. Almost as if it has a mind of its own.
822186 Mind? [scoffs] It's a tree.
822003 A tree that grew a castle.
822185 Was that before or after Discord made chocolate rain?
822485 [whispers] After.
822184 I'm never gonna learn pony history!
822000 [school bell rings]
822003 You can all show me what you've learned on tomorrow's test – "Friendship's Effect on the Course of Equestrian History".
822000 [students groan]
822003 Remember! Study groups are both fun and effective!
822000 [students chattering]
822188 So, who wants to study together?
822184 With other students? This is Equestria! If you want the real scoop, there's only one place to go. Hello, oh maaaaagical Equestrian tree! Can you tell me everything I need to know about friendship?
822000 [beat]
822188 [groans]
822183 [laughing]
822000 [shimmering sounds]
822000 [theme song]
822186 The Elements of Harmony grew the Tree?
8224b8 [groan]
822189 No! The Pillars grew the Tree.
822188 The Tree grew the Elements, and then the box with six locks.
822189 But our professors found six keys and unlocked the box.
822184 I'm so gonna fail.
822185 You guys! Check this out!
822184 That's a plumbing diagram on how to fix a sink.
822185 [giggles]
822188 What does that have to do with Equestrian history?
822185 Nothing. I just can't believe that's how sinks work! Where's Yona?
822187 [snoring]
822186 [laughs] Apparently, [imitating Yona] yaks no love study groups!
822184 Shhhh. [laughs]
822187 [snoring] Spider! No!
822183 [laughing]
822485 [giggles]
822188 Hey, Cozy. What are you doing here?
822485 I volunteered to help Professor Sparkle organize these books. So, experts on Equestrian history yet?
822184 I think I'd be better off studying the plumbing book. This stuff is impossible.
822000 [changeling zap]
822189 Oh, come on, Gallus! With good friends and solid study habits, anything is possible!
822184 [laughs]
822186 How about you just tell us what's on tomorrow's test, professor?
8224b9 [excited chatter]
822000 [changeling zap]
822189 Now, hold on a sec. I can't give y'all a sneak peek. That there wouldn't be honest.
8224ba [laughing]
822485 [clears throat] Golly, it's so inspiring how relaxed you all are about studying friendship, considering your disadvantage.
822187 What cute pony mean?
822485 Just consider where you all came from. If Sandbar hadn't sacrificed so much of his time to get you up to speed, who knows how behind you'd be?
822188 That's... not what—
822485 [to Ocellus] I mean, growing up as a love-starved changeling? [to Silverstream] Or hiding underwater from an evil king all those years? Trusting anycreature must be so hard for you. [to Gallus] And griffons never want to be around anycreature, even other griffons. [to Smolder] And dragons are so fierce compared to us. There must be days you can't wait to get away from all us cute ponies. [to Yona, imitating Yona] "Everypony know yaks think yaks are best!" Making friends with any other creature must seem like a step down. It's just so impressive how you keep trying to understand friendship, even though it isn't in your nature. Oh! I'll let you borrow my notes! It's what friends do. I'll be right back!
822185 We... should... get back to studying.
822000 [tapping]
822000 [loud, echoing tapping]
822184 Could you stop that clicking?! I'm trying to focus!
822188 Dude!
822184 What? We have a test. I don't know every detail about every adventure the professors went on like you do.
822189 That's why we're studying together.
822186 Right. To help us "disadvantaged" creatures.
822187 Yona confused. Why we all upset?
822000 [clang!]
822000 [shimmering sounds]
822185 I only glanced at that plumbing book, but I'm pretty sure this isn't supposed to be here.
822189 What are you doing?
822186 Dragon. Strange magical cave. What do you think I'm doing?
822189 [grunts]
822188 [startled whinny]
822000 [shimmering sounds]
822185 Did we know this was down here?
822188 I don't think anypony knows this is down here.
822000 [hoofsteps echoing]
8224bb [stilted] Welcome.
822188 Headmare Twilight? Where are we?
8224bb [stilted] Where you need to be.
822187 Uh, Yona confused.
8224bb [stilted] It is as I feared. You are not one. What has happened?
822189 We were studying friendship's effect on history, but then...
822184 Since friendship just isn't in our nature, what's the point?
8224bb [stilted] You do not believe friendship is in your nature? That is NOT acceptable!
822000 [wind whistling]
822185 Our headmare is glowing, you guys. What is going on?!
822189 We should probably get back to studying for the test.
822000 [wind stops]
8224bb A test. Yes. By sunrise, this door will be closed. Finish the test before then, and you may go. Fail the test, and here you will stay.
822000 [teleportation zaps]
822188 Huh?
822184 Huh?
822186 Huh?
822187 [shudders]
822000 [water rushing]
822185 Ooh!
822000 [splash]
822185 Mount Aris? Headmare Twilight sent me home? Wait. Am I suspended? Hello? Anygriff here? Hmm. They must be topside.
822000 [distant growling]
822185 Huh? [gasps, screams]
822000 [magic zap]
822000 [splash]
822185 [screams]
822000 [growling sounds]
822185 The Storm King?! He's back?!
822184 Big room. No exits. Big deal.
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 Not cool! [hyperventilates]
822187 Nothing for yaks to be afraid of. Just empty cave. Nothing in here can hurt—
822000 [skittering]
822187 ...Yona.
822000 [spiders chittering]
822186 Ugh. Things like this just don't happen in the Dragon Lands. Huh?
8224bc ...And I told her she was the cutest pony of all ponies!
8224bd [to Smolder] Ohhh! Aren't you just the most adorable thing? Come join us.
822000 [beat]
822186 No. On so many levels. No.
822000 [screech!]
822186 Huh?
8224bc Come sit by me, and let's compliment each other!
822186 [groans]
822189 [gasps] Why do you look like that?
82239d What do you mean? We all look the same.
822189 Not me.
82240d Of course not you... your Majesty. We'll go drain the love from those pathetic ponies in Ponyville just as you ordered.
822189 [whimpers, gasps] Nooooo!
8224be Oh! Thank heavens we found you!
8224bf There's an emergency! And we need you, Sandbar!
822188 [gasps] My first friendship adventure! Yes! Count me in! Oh, I've been waiting for this— Wait! The others!
8224bf We don't need them! We need you! Come on!
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 Aah! Come on, Gallus. Get it together. Deep breaths. [inhaling and exhaling] Ah... Ahh... Achoo!
822000 [shing!]
822184 [panicked whimpering] Okay. If this is a test, there's got to be a way out. It's just a puzzle... that will squash you if you don't figure it out.
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 [laughs] No pressure. [exhales]
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822000 [shing!]
822184 Oops.
822000 [cracking sounds]
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 [panting]
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 Hah! [grunting]
822000 [shing!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822000 [thud]
822186 [groans] Look. I have to get out of here and find my friends. So just tell me what I have to do to pass this test. I'm not afraid of anything.
8224bd Um, I dunno. Seems like she's afraid to be cute and adorable, doesn't it?
8224bc Or maybe she's just afraid to admit she likes being cute and adorable.
8224bd Mm-hmm!
822186 Just this once. [clears throat, cute voice] May I have some tea, please?
8224bc Aw, but you can't have tea if you aren't dressed for it.
822186 Okay. But let's keep this between us.
822186 [slurps, giggles]
822187 [panting]
822000 [spiders chittering]
822187 Huh? [panicked grunting, screams]
822000 [thud!]
822187 [screams, panting, screams, whimpers] Yona need help! Where Yona's friends when Yona need them?! [screams]
822000 [spider chitters]
822187 Huh?
822000 [spider chitters]
822187 Yona... no mean to scream. Yona love making friends. Spiders friends?
822000 [spider chitters]
822187 Wait. What little spider say?
822000 [cracking sounds]
822186 What happened to you?
822184 What happened to you?
822186 You never saw any of that. Got it?
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 Maybe the others got out already and we're the last ones?
822186 [sarcastic] Yeah, that totally seems like something they would do.
822184 [groans] Any other dragon or griffon would save themselves and get out of this crazy cave.
822186 Guess we aren't just any dragon or griffon anymore.
822184 Guess not. You go that way. I'll check over there.
822188 Wait. I really should find my friends.
8224be Darling, it was so generous of you to take the time to teach those other creatures about friendship.
8224bf But if you're going to join us and do something that really makes a difference, we need to know where your loyalty lies.
8224be You do want to impress us, don't you, Sandbar?
822189 [crying]
822186 Huh? Ocellus?
822189 Go away.
822186 We're still in those weird caves beneath the school. We've gotta get out of here. [gasps] Chrysalis! Where's Ocellus?!
822189 It's me! I'm hideous! [crying]
822184 Hello?!
822000 [bubbling]
822184 Where are—? Whoa!
822000 [splash!]
822185 Shhhh! The Storm King will hear you!
822184 The Storm King? He was defeated. We're still under the school. This is all just some crazy test.
822000 [growling sounds]
822184 Okay, that's horrifying.
822185 I can't find any Hippogriffs or seaponies. They must all be captured! Gallus! Get back down here!
822000 [growling continues]
822184 It's not real.
822185 Yes, it is! He's back, and I'm never gonna see another sunset or fly through a cloud bank or study plumbing! He's gonna take away everything I love! I'm gonna be trapped down here forever!
822184 I'm afraid of being trapped, too! I'm scared of small spaces.
822185 Really?
822184 Yeah. And I was stuck in a room that kept shrinking. But I realized I had to face my fear, and I found the way out. This is your test. He isn't really here.
822000 [growling sounds]
822185 But what if he is?
822184 Then tell him exactly what you think of him.
822000 [magic zap]
822185 Uh, hey! Storm King! You're nothing but a big, old bully with a silly name and a goofy crown! You thought you could scare us into doing whatever you wanted! But we learned that together, we're stronger than you! And now that we're rid of you, we're gonna soar through the sky and go on adventures and never give you another thought ever! [stomps]
822000 [rocks toppling]
822185 Ha-ha! I did it! I told him!
822184 Okay. Heh. Hug time later. W-We still have to get back to the library.
822186 You're a changeling. Just change back.
822189 I can't.
822000 [changeling zap]
822189 Maybe my past was so horrible, it's still inside me just waiting to come out again.
822186 That's ridiculous. That's not who you are anymore. You've changed.
822189 Maybe we can't really change that much.
822186 [muffled] I like cute, silly stuff.
822189 I'm sorry, what?
822186 I like cute, silly stuff! But ever since school started, I've realized that sometimes I kinda don't mind cute stuff.
822189 [laughs]
822186 If a dragon like me can admit she likes tea parties, that's proof we can change. I was gonna invite you to a top-secret tea party with me, but if you want to stay down here...
822189 Oh! No! I want to come!
822000 [changeling zap]
822186 I thought that might work. Come on, let's go!
822185 Where's Yona and Sandbar?
822184 The way out is closing!
822186 We aren't leaving without them!
822000 [spiders chittering]
822187 Yona find you guys!
8224a0 [screams]
822185 Hey, Yona. Who's your... spider army?
822187 Yona always scared of spiders. But then Yona meet Spindle.
8224c0 [chitters]
822187 Yona realize no reason to be afraid. Spiders and yak friends! So Yona ask new friends to help finding old friends!
822184 Do you think your new friends can help us find Sandbar?
8224c0 [chitters]
822186 Of all the strange things that have happened tonight, that's the strangest, right?
822188 Okay, enough! I'm not going anywhere without my friends!
8224bf So you don't care about anypony but your friends? Are you really that selfish?
8224be Honestly, you really are such a disappointment.
822188 I've always looked up to you. You would never turn your back on each other, and that's what makes you strong. Now I have a group of friends that I think is every bit as amazing as yours. If I have to give up on them to make you proud, then you aren't the ponies I thought you were. I don't care if I disappoint you. You disappoint me.
822000 [shimmer!]
822185 Did you just tell our professors you were disappointed in them?
822188 Something tells me those weren't actually our professors. Besides, they tried to get between me and my friends.
822186 That's all very sweet. Now, can we please get out of here?!
822000 [cracking sounds]
822188 [grunting] You! You're not Headmare Twilight, are you?
822189 [gasps] You're the Tree of Harmony!
822185 The Tree of Harmony turned into a sparkly version of our headmare to talk to us? Did I miss a chapter in class?
8224c1 Like all living things, I change as I grow. As I have grown, so have my abilities.
822184 I'm a bit rusty on pony history. But since when does the Tree of Harmony trap creatures in a cave with their biggest fears?!
8224c1 You chose what you saw in my roots, not me.
822188 [gasps] Our friendship got us past our fears!
8224c1 You were more concerned with each other's well-being than your own. You were strong when your friends were weak. You let each other in and showed that you would be there for each other, no matter what. Friendship is in your nature.
822000 [shimmer!]
822000 [cracking sounds]
822184 W-We just learned a friendship lesson from a tree, didn't we?
822485 You're all right! I came back with my notes and saw this and didn't know what to think!
822185 We're better than all right! We just got tested by the Tree of Harmony! And we totally passed!
822485 The Tree of Harmony? Here?
822185 Yeah! Well, below here. Under the school! We found this and went down and met the Tree, and Gallus was all, [imitating Gallus] "Friendship is not in our nature." And the Tree was like, "Whaaaaat?!" And it tested us!
822186 Long story short, friendship is in our nature. The Tree said so.
822189 I guess we should tell somepony there's a giant magical hole in the library.
822000 [clang!]
822189 Or not.
822188 We have to tell our professors about this! They won't believe that—!
822485 You can't!
822187 Why no?
822485 Because... it's my fault. You were all getting along so well, and I felt left out. I was jealous. And it upset you so much, the Tree of Harmony had to test you. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna get expelled for sure! [crying] Please don't tell anypony about this! Especially the professors! Please, please, please—!
822186 Okay! [yawns] I'm actually too tired to do anything right now.
822188 Yeah, but we can't go to sleep. We'll miss the test.
822184 [yawns] The test! I almost forgot!
822189 [yawns] We're all gonna fail.
8224c2 [snoring]
822485 What if I tell Professor Sparkle I needed help organizing these books, and you were all kind enough to pitch in? I'll get you an extension!
822188 [yawns] Thanks, Cozy. That's nice of you.
822485 I'm just so sorry I caused all of this. You're such good friends. I'm sorry I ever doubted you.
822185 [sleepily] Mmm... No problem... Friendship is... [snoring]
822485 You get some rest. Don't give any of this another thought. Just let Cozy take care of everything.
822000 [credits]
823003 I can't believe you two are going on a friendship quest! This is amazing!
823008 What do you mean, Twilight? We've been on one together before.
823003 Exactly! This is the first time the map has teamed up the same ponies for a second quest!
82300e That is special.
823008 Heh. Must be 'cause we're extra good at solvin' friendship problems.
823003 I hope so, 'cause it looks like this one might be a little tricky. You're going to the Peaks of Peril.
82300e The Peaks of... P-P-Peril?!
823008 Aw, it's just a name. It doesn't mean anythin'.
82300e Like how Cloudsdale is in the clouds and the Crystal Empire's made of crystal?
823008 Fair point. So, what can ya tell us about the place, Twilight?
823003 Only what Rockhoof told me. Back in his day, nopony knew much about the Peaks of Peril except for the legend on this ancient shield. It says a group called the Kirin used to live there, known for their kindness and truth-speaking.
823008 Now we know why the Map called us.
823003 Unfortunately, other creatures also lived there. The Nirik, fearsome beasts of pure fire.
82300e [shudders] Maybe you should go instead of me, Twilight. [laughs nervously]
823003 Sorry, Fluttershy. Flanks don't lie.
823000 [shimmering]
823008 Aw, I'm sure the two of us'll get that friendship problem solved, no matter what kind o' creature has it.
82300e [laughs nervously]
823000 [theme song]
823000 [train chugging]
823000 [brakes hiss]
823000 [train chugging]
823000 [wind whistling]
823008 Guess nopony else is goin' out as far as we are.
82300e Maybe they know something we don't?
823008 Now, Fluttershy, I've told you a dozen times. There's nothin' to be sca—
8234c3 [screams]
823134 [scream]
8234c3 I'm sorry.
82300e [screams] You really startled us.
8234c3 Oh, it's just that I'm not used to seeing anypony taking the train to... [ominously] the end of the line. The final destination. The last stop!
823008 We get the picture. Why?
8234c3 Nothing but uncharted terrain and wild beasts out that way. [maniacal laughter]
823008 Well, maybe there's a little somethin' to be scared of.
823008 Yah!
823000 [squishing]
823000 [Fly-ders buzzing]
823008 [groans]
823000 [rocks crumbling]
823000 [rustling]
823008 [panting] Those must be the Peaks of Peril. Whew. Tough goin', huh, Fluttershy—? Fluttershy? [groans]
823008 Yah! [grunts]
823000 [squishing]
823000 [Fly-ders buzzing]
823008 [groans]
823008 [pants]
823000 [splash!]
823000 [squirrel chittering]
82300e There. That should be enough flowers to keep your tree cozy.
823008 Fluttershy! What are you doin'?! This is no time for visitin' varmints! We're on a friendship quest, remember?!
82300e Yes, but actua—
823008 Come on! We're burnin' daylight!
82300e I know, but what I found out is that—
823008 Now, we gotta get up that peak! I figure if we use some rope and elbow grease, we can make it up half—
82300e Applejack! Can you please listen to me?! [clears throat] What I'm trying to say is the squirrels told me a shortcut they take to the Kirin village.
823000 [grinding]
823000 [rustling]
823008 Oh. [chuckles] Sorry, Fluttershy. I suppose I got a little too caught up in the adventure.
82300e That's all right. If you hadn't come back to get me, I probably would've talked to the squirrels all day. Heh.
823134 [gasp]
82300e [giggles]
823000 [rustling]
82300e I hope that's not a Nirik! [gasps]
823008 Show yourself!
82300e [shudders]
823008 Well, hi. I'm Applejack, and this here's Fluttershy.
823000 [beat]
82300e If you have any friendship problems, we're here to help.
823000 [beat]
823008 Huh. [to Fluttershy] Quiet bunch, ain't they? [clears throat] We're from Equestria, and we're plumb tickled to meet y'all.
823000 [beat]
823008 S-So, uh... what are your names?
823000 [beat]
823008 [stressing] Ap-ple-jack! Flut-ter-shy! Remember?
82300e [whispering, to Applejack] Maybe they don't understand us.
823008 [stressing] Do. You. Un-der-stand. Ponish?
823000 [beat]
82300e Oh! But you don't speak?
823000 [beat]
823008 Don't or won't?
82300e Will you excuse us for a moment? [to Applejack] You have to ask yes-or-no questions, or they won't answer.
823008 Like talkin' to Angel Bunny?
82300e Not exactly. I can always tell what Angel is feeling. But these Kirin don't show anything.
823008 Well, how are we gonna solve a friendship problem if none of 'em will tell us what it is?
823008 These Kirin are quieter than an apple blossom on snowfall. Still, there's gotta be some way to make 'em speak. [chuckles] Beautiful day, ain't it?
823000 [beat]
823008 [whinny] Knock, knock! Now you say, "Who's there?"
823000 [beat]
823008 Police. "Police who?" Police [please] say somethin'!
823000 [beat]
823008 Uh-oh! I feel a sneeze comin' on! Aaaa-CHOOOOO!
823000 [beat]
82300e Gesundheit.
823008 [groans] Don't any o' y'all talk?!
823000 [beat]
823008 Now we're gettin' somewhere.
82300e A dark spooky path that leads into unknown territory?
823008 Tell you what, sugarcube. You stay and see if you can get anythin' outta these here Kirin. I'll go and try to find one that talks.
82300e Phew! Be careful. And watch out for Niriks!
823000 [rustling]
823008 [yelps] Phew! [yelps] Oh. Have you seen a Kirin that talks?
823000 [beat]
823008 Any idea where I should look?
823000 [beat]
823008 Oh, for the love of Celestia! Can't ya just say somethin'?!
8234c4 [giggles] Gotcha! Sorry, sorry, but that was too good. Oh, you don't know how much I missed jokes. Hi-larity! Am I pronouncing that right? Some words I haven't said in a will. While! While. Hi, I'm Autumn Blaze. You've just arrived, and perhaps you're tired or hungry or reflective and want to sleep and eat and journal? Which you should do, of course! But first— Oh! Oh, what joy to talk with another creature! It's been so long! You must tell me everything about you! There's so much to say, so much to do! Oh, look at me. I'm going on, and you haven't seen— I mean, have you seen—? W-What am I saying? Of course you haven't. So just— I— yeah— I will j— Follow me!
823000 [beat]
823008 That... was somethin', all right.
823000 [wind whistling]
823008 Oh, wow. [gasps] This... is amazin'.
8234c4 Oh, you think so, too?! The way the light shimmers off everything, like, like it all suddenly woke up the moment you saw it. And you realize maybe the water and the mountains and the forest and the... yes, the rainbow and the stars and the sky are all looking back at you thinking the same thing? That we are a part of the everything. That maybe there's just one thing and we are all it.
823000 [beat]
823008 I was gonna say it's pretty. But yeah.
8234c4 [hums, sniffs] Mmmm! And this is just the first stop on a journey of amazing things to see, smell, tiptoe through. Oh, I haven't been able to share all of this with anypony in forever! Since they all took that vow of silence. So it's a lot for me to pro-cess. Process? Uh, deal with.
823008 Whoa there. Vow of silence?
8234c4 That's, uh... That's why they asked me to leave.
823008 I hope it's not a sore subject, but... you mind explainin' why y'all went quiet in the first place?
8234c4 It's a long story.
823008 [sighs] You'd rather not talk about it?
8234c4 No.
823008 I-I under—
8234c4 [begins singing] I'd rather... siiiiiiiiiiiing!
8234c4 [Autumn Blaze]
8234c4 La, la-la-la, la-la
8234c4 La-la-la, la-la-la
8234c4 The Kirin used to speak and sing
8234c4 We weren't always quiet
8234c4 We told stories and funny jokes
8234c4 My stand-up was a riot
8234c4 But then one day, a fight broke out
8234c4 And hurtful words were said
8234c4 Flaring tempers were inflamed
8234c4 Destruction quickly spread
8234c4 And flaming bred from head to head
8234c4 It even burnt our... bread
8234c4 Sorry, I forgot how much I love rhyming. Where was I? Oh, right!
8234c4 My happy village lay in ruins
8234c4 Relationships got worse
8234c4 Spoiler alert - we quickly learned
8234c4 That words could be a curse
8234c4 No more talking yelled our leader
8234c4 The last thing said aloud
8234c4 Into the Stream of Silence
8234c4 We stepped as a crowd
8234c4 The water cooled emotions
8234c4 And peace was soon restored
8234c4 But with no way to speak my thoughts
8234c4 I got super... bored
8234c4 Seriously, there's only so long that Sudoku can keep you entertained!
8234c4 'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
8234c4 Unless you let it rain
8234c4 And shiny apples sometimes come with worms
8234c4 No, you can't give up your laughter
8234c4 'Cause you're scared of a little pain
8234c4 It's a lesson that the Kirin never learned
8234c4 I was stuck in silent prison
8234c4 With the voices in my head
8234c4 'Til I tripped over my salvation
8234c4 In a helpful flowerbed
8234c4 I found a cure to clear my pipes
8234c4 And I became quite chatty
8234c4 With years and years of stored-up words
8234c4 I drove my village batty
8234c4 They didn't like my jokes and songs
8234c4 And daily dose of news
8234c4 The plays I wrote, the speeches spoke
8234c4 Variety revues
8234c4 Or the story about the Kirin who hid below an opera stage
8234c4 And fell in love with this opera singer, and he wore a freaky half-mask thing, and he played the organ a lot and got all broody 'cause the singer was in love with another dude, so he took her away on this underground gondola. I mean, who doesn't love musical theater?!
8234c4 The village leader made it clear
8234c4 I had to make my choice
8234c4 I could stay and live with them
8234c4 Or I could keep my voice
8234c4 So I came here, but left the couch alone
8234c4 They're hard to move
8234c4 With just the view for company
8234c4 Until ya heard me groove
8234c4 Take it away, boys!
823000 [beat]
823000 'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
823000 Unless you let it rain
823000 And candles just won't glow until they're burned
823000 No, you can't give up your laughter
823000 'Cause you're scared of a little pain
823000 It's a lesson that my village never learned
823000 No matter how hard I schooled them
823000 Fear of hurt is still what ruled them
823000 Sometimes you gotta let it raaaaaaaain!
823000 Yeah, sometimes you've gotta let it rain
823008 [gasps] I can't believe it! Nopony should give up feelin'... their feelin's just to keep from gettin' angry!
8234c4 That's what I said! You know, after I started talking again.
823008 [gasps] I bet this here's the problem that Fluttershy and I came to help y'all with!
8234c4 Really? Who's Fluttershy? Oh! Did you name your shadow? Mine's called "Silhouette Gloom of the Sundown Lands".
823008 Right... Well, I'm thinkin' if we just go talk to the other Kirin, we can get 'em to welcome you back proper-like. Maybe even convince 'em to take your cure.
8234c4 Oh, yes! Yes, of course! Oh, just one small thing. The antidote from my anecdote? It's gone.
823008 There's no cure left?!
8234c4 I used the last of the foal's-breath flowers to make it. And I-I haven't seen them bloom since.
823008 [sighs] Well, this wouldn't be a friendship quest if it was easy. I'm gonna start by gettin' your friends to welcome you back!
8234c4 You know, between you and me, I'm not sure she's gonna convince them. [deep voice] Nope! [normal voice] But... [whispering] I hope she does.
823008 [panting] Fluttershy! Guess what!
823134 I figured out the friendship problem! Me, too! Go ahead! [laugh]
823008 Bet that's a problem the Kirin never have.
82300e [giggles] No.
823008 Anyhow, we gotta get 'em all talkin' again.
82300e Oh, no-no-no-no-no! We can't ever let that happen!
823008 I thought you said you figured out the friendship problem. Was somethin' lost in translation?
82300e The Kirin are usually peaceful and kind. But when they get mad, they turn into Niriks, creatures made of fire and vengeance!
823008 Heh. That seemed less scary when it was in a song.
82300e The last time they all argued, they got so angry, they accidentally destroyed their whole village. So the Kirin decided to make sure it would never happen again.
823008 But that's no reason to stop talkin'.
82300e Yes, it is! Fire is dangerous, especially in a forest like this. Why, think of all the animals it could hurt.
823008 Not if they don't turn into fire-breathin' Nirik in the first place.
82300e And how can you be sure that won't happen?
823008 There's gotta be a better way than givin' up all your feelin's!
82300e Applejack! You're not listening!
823008 'Cause you're not talkin' any sense!
82300e Um, what are they doing?
823134 [yelp]
82300e [grunts] Maybe they got worried because we were arguing with each other.
823008 Aw, shucks! We were just havin' a normal, civil disagreement! Honest!
82300e W-Where are they taking us?! [grunting]
823008 To the Stream of Silence! If we hit that water, we'll never be able to talk or feel anythin' ever again!
823134 [gasp]
8234c4 [distorted] Put them down!
823000 [flames roaring]
82300e [whimpering]
823008 It's all right. I think I know this one. And she's tryin' to help.
8234c4 Well, yeah! Can't have them silence the only friend who'll speak to me.
82300e She talks?
823008 You have no idea. Fluttershy, meet Autumn Blaze.
82300e Well, thank you for that... um, wall of fire. But I thought Niriks were dangerous when they're angry. How did you know you could control your temper?
8234c4 I didn't. Huh. I guess anger's like other feelings. It's not about having them. It's what you do with them.
823008 And givin' up happiness to keep away anger is no kind o' life.
82300e I never thought of it that way. I can't imagine not being able to talk to my animal friends.
8234c4 Fern Flare, you used to love to laugh at everything. And Rain Shine, you sung the most beautiful harmonies. Don't you miss it?
823008 I know you're worried about fightin'. But friends can disagree without causin' a ruckus.
82300e Everypony gets mad sometimes. Even Applejack and I argue.
823008 What?! When do we ever argue?
82300e [clears throat] On the way here? And about the Kirin being silent? And right now!
823134 [growl, laugh]
823008 We don't always see eye-to-eye. But we never let that get in the way of our friendship.
82300e And if you're really angry, then take some time away to be a Nirik where it won't hurt anypony.
823008 I-I think they're tryin' to say somethin'.
8234c4 Okay, are you hungry? Oh, no. Is some Kirin trapped in a well? Okay, "baby". "Baby fish". "Ba"— "Ba"— No. "Baby fish mouth"? Uh, something? Anything?! [groans] Just write it down! [groans] This is making me furious. Would you excuse me? I'll be right back. [distorted scream] You were saying?
823000 [beat]
8234c4 Ohhhh! You want the cure for the Stream of Silence!
82300e That's wonderful! Uh, isn't it?
823008 Well, it would be. Except there aren't any flowers left to make the cure.
82300e Are you sure?
8234c4 Oh, beyond sure. Believe me, I've had a lot of alone time lately. I searched the entire forest seventy-three and a half times. Although I wonder if that second half could make a difference.
82300e Hmm. I wish she'd told us what kind of flowers she's looking for.
823008 They're called foal's-breath.
82300e I've never heard of that.
823000 [squirrel chittering]
823008 Uh, Fluttershy? A little help?
823000 [squirrel chittering]
82300e [gasps] He says he knows where to find foal's-breath!
823008 Well, what are we waitin' for? Lead the way!
82300e [gasps] That's what foal's-breath looks like?!
823008 Autumn Blaze never would've made it past the Peaks to search here. I owe you an apology.
82300e Why?
823008 'Cause if your kindness hadn't made you stop to help the squirrels, we never would've found this here flower.
82300e And if your honesty hadn't convinced the Kirin to talk, we wouldn't need to find it.
823008 [chuckles] Guess it's a good thing the map sent both of us, huh?
8234c4 [gasps] You found them?! Where were they?! Tell me everything, and feel free to add complicated descriptions and comedic tangents!
823000 [beat]
8234c4 Oh. Right. First things first.
823000 [shimmering]
823000 [Kirin laughing, cheering, singing]
8234c5 Autumn Blaze, you have given us a gift. The realization that anger is within us, but it is our choice how we let it out. We would very much like it if you came back to live with us. I can't say how much we've missed your beautiful voice.
8234c4 [Autumn Blaze]
8234c4 'Cause rainbows won't light up the sky
8234c4 Unless you let it rain
8234c4 And candles just won't glow until they're burned
8234c4 No, you can't give up your laughter
8234c4 'Cause you're scared of a little pain
8234c4 It's a lesson that my village never learned
8234c4 Oh, yes, 'cause rainbows won't light up the sky
8234c4 Unless you let it...
8234c4 Raaaaaaaain!
823000 [shimmering]
823000 [credits]
824003 Woo-hoo-hoo!
824005 Whoa! Ta-da!
824003 Okay, Spike. Now let's try a flip. Remember – two flaps, then straight up!
824005 Got it!
824000 [flapping]
824005 [grunts]
824000 [splash]
824005 [inhales]
824000 [flapping]
824000 [bump]
824000 [thud]
824000 [crash]
824000 [fwip]
824000 [thud]
824003 You're doing great, Spike! Now let's see the big finish!
824005 [sighs]
824000 [sloop!]
824005 Whoa-oa-oa-oa!
824000 [crash]
824005 [grunts] I don't know about "big", but I am definitely finished.
824003 Maybe I should get Rainbow Dash. She's the one who taught me advanced flying techniques.
824005 No, thanks. If I'm gonna mess up, I'd rather do it in front of you. I just don't understand why none of your advice is helping.
824186 Because she's teaching you to fly like a pony instead of a dragon.
824005 What's the difference?
824186 Well, we don't have feathers, for starters.
824005 Ye-he-he-hes!
824000 [hoof-bump]
824005 Wow! Thank you so much! How did you know I just needed to bend my wings?
824186 Honestly, this is Dragon 101. Usually dragon parents teach this stuff.
824000 [knock, knock]
824000 [door opens]
824003 Spike, I've been thinking about our flying lesson.
824005 Uh-huh...
824003 I can't believe I overlooked something as simple as feathers. It's no wonder you were having trouble. I wish I had more "dragonish" knowledge to give you. Do you think being raised by ponies has affected you in other ways? Spike?
824005 Did you say something, Twilight? Sorry. I'm just finishing up this "thank-you" throw pillow for Smolder. And you know how I get when I'm in the embroidery zone.
824003 [chuckles]
824000 [theme song]
824005 It's a pillow! But not for your head. Although it could be. It's a throw pillow. They're more casual. You can use 'em anywhere. You don't like it.
824186 Uh, it's not that. It's just dragons don't really use pillows. At all.
824005 What?
824186 Hey, what's that?
824005 I don't know. But it's... heading right for us!
824000 [crash!]
824005 Okay. Now I really owe you for the lesson.
8244c6 [groans, chuckles] Hey there, young dragons. [coughs] Name's Sludge. How are yours tails shakin'? [groans]
824005 You all right?
824186 Yeah. What happened?
8244c6 To what?
824000 [thud]
8244c6 Oh. I don't need to explain myself to a couple of baby dragons. [groaning and whimpering]
824000 [thud]
8244c6 Ow...
824005 Maybe not. But you're hurt and need help. So I'm taking you to Twilight's castle whether you like it or not?
8244c6 Castle, eh? [groans]
824003 I'm glad Spike brought you here, Sludge. I understand you made quite the impression in town.
824007 Literally! There's a hole and everything!
8244c6 Well, I hope you're not expecting me to fix it. [groans]
824008 It doesn't look like you're in much shape to do anything.
8244c6 I'll manage. Dragons take care of themselves. I don't need help from a bunch of castle-livin' ponies. [whimpers]
82400d Darling, do be careful.
8244c6 I'm... [groans] ...fine.
824000 [thud]
82400e I can't watch!
82400c You're not the first stubborn dragon we've met, you know?
824005 And sometimes, even dragons need help.
824003 I promise. My friends and I will only do enough to get you back on your claws.
824000 [montage music]
824000 [sewing machine whirring]
824000 [cider press whirring]
8244c6 [sighs]
824000 [crash!]
824000 [doors creak]
8244c6 [sniffs]
824000 [clang!]
824000 [thud]
8244c6 [chewing noisily]
8244c7 [cheer]
8244c6 [chomp]
824003 I know you had your reservations, but it's good to see you feeling better.
8244c6 T-Thanks, I guess.
82400d That's what friends are for, darling.
8244c6 You're pretty lucky to have friends like these, kid.
824005 Actually, I was orphaned as an egg, and Twilight raised me. So these ponies are more than my friends. They're my family.
824003 We try our best, but sometimes I worry that maybe Spike is...
824005 Missing something deep down and dragonish.
8244c6 Really? Wow. I-I can't tell you how glad I am to hear that.
824008 Why in Equestria would you be glad to hear that?
8244c6 I wasn't gonna say anything since your life seemed so perfect, but I have a confession to make. Coming to Ponyville wasn't an accident. I was looking for you. Spike... [sighs] I'm your father.
824012 [gasp]
824007 [continues gasping] Sorry.
824003 So you crashed in Ponyville on purpose?
8244c6 Well, the crash part wasn't on purpose, but heading here was. I've been searching everywhere for you, kid.
824005 Did you ask in the Crystal Empire? I'm kind of well-known there.
824007 Actually, Spike's well-known everywhere. Not a lot of dragons were hatched by the Princess of Friendship.
824008 Mm-hmm.
8244c6 [choked up] You make it sound so simple. I wish you'd been there to help me search.
824000 [doors open]
824005 I can't believe it. I have so many questions.
8244c6 Well, ask away. Answering questions is what dads are for.
824005 I guess my biggest question is simple. Why was I an orphaned egg?
8244c6 [stammers] You sure you don't want to ask something else? [choked up] It's a lot of painful memories. [sighs] Your mother was the best dragon I'd ever met.
8244c6 [voiceover] The Dragon Lord even picked her to scout for the Great Migration, and-and even though she just laid your egg, we knew she'd have to go. But finding the Migration route could take a lifetime, and you deserved a chance to know your mother. So I went looking for you, carrying your egg to places no dragon or pony has ever been. Past Mount Aris, the abandoned home of the Hippogriffs...
824007 Ooh! Did you visit Klugetown?
8244c6 You've been to Klugetown?
824012 [various affirming]
824003 Also, the Hippogriffs returned to Mount Aris after we helped them defeat the Storm King.
8244c6 Oh, well, have you heard of the Land of the... Scale Collectors?
824003 Uh-uh.
8244c6 [to Spike] Because that's where your mother's trail finally led.
8244c6 [voiceover] To a prison world of dragon hunters, where I was forced to choose between surrendering myself or surrendering your egg.
824000 [clang!]
8244c6 [voiceover, choked up] Of course, there was no way I was gonna sacrifice my boy. So they took me instead, and that's where I'd been ever since.
8244c6 Locked up somewhere not even the Princess of Friendship has heard of.
824005 Whoa... How did you know I was a boy?
82400e Whatever happened to Spike's mom?
82400c And how did the egg make it all the way back to Equestria by itself?
824007 Hmm?
8244c6 I wish I had all the answers. [crying]
824005 Well, that's all in the past. The only thing that matters now is that we're together. And I'm gonna make up for lost time.
824005 I hope you don't mind, but I have a list of all the things I always wanted to do with my dad?
8244c6 Mind? Spike, my boy, with you by my side, I feel like we could do anything. What do you want to do first?
824005 Well, I've kind of been working on a list for a long time.
824000 [scroll unrolls]
8244c6 Dude, you want to do all of this?
824005 Oh. I mean, w-we don't have to.
8244c6 If you think doing everything on this incredibly long list is gonna fill the hole where your dragonishness should be, then that is exactly what we're gonna do!
824005 [gasps]
824000 [montage music]
824009 [blows whistle]
8244c6 [chomp, belches fire]
824007 Woo-hoo!
824005 Oh, yeah!
824000 [wind whistling]
824000 [paper tearing]
824000 [paper tearing]
824000 [oven timer rings]
8244c6 [chewing noisily]
8244c6 [gulps]
824005 I can't believe we got so many things done. But this is all my stuff. Is there anything you always wanted to do with me?
8244c6 Not really.
824000 [beat]
8244c6 Uhhh, I mean, uh, I'm happy to do whatever you want. But if I had a castle like this with all this stuff, I'd probably just lay around all day doing nothing like a real dragon.
824005 Like a real dragon?
8244c6 Sure! I'm not surprised you don't know any better. Twilight basically raised you as a pony. You're barely a dragon at all.
824005 Huh?
824000 [doors open]
824003 Hey, Spike! How are things going with Sludge?
824005 Honestly, I thought having him around would make me feel more dragonish. But I kind of feel less.
824003 Oh, I'm sorry. I wish I could help.
8244c6 Awww, shucks. [chewing noisily] I guess I shouldn't have said anything about you being more pony than dragon. I just wish we had more in common.
824003 Maybe you two can come up with ways to turn up Spike's, uh, dragonishness.
824005 You think that's something we can do?
8244c6 You know what, son? I think it is!
8244c6 Spike, I'm gonna teach you a thing or two about being a dragon. So, listen up, my boy, because I'm only gonna say this once.
8244c6 Look at this castle where you live
824005 It's pretty sweet, right?
8244c6 [Sludge]
8244c6 You can't be a dragon here
824005 Uh, I can't?
8244c6 [Sludge]
8244c6 Look at these books up on the wall
824005 Hey, I just finished organizing those!
8244c6 [Sludge]
8244c6 This treasure pile's not right, I fear
8244c6 Trust me, I got you covered here. You see all this soft pony stuff you're surrounded with? This has got to be the first thing to go.
8244c6 Nothin' 'bout this place says "dragon den", there's too much fluff
8244c6 All these fancy robes, toss in a pile
8244c6 Take those goblets, dishes, is that gold? Still not enough!
8244c6 De-ponifying might just take a while
8244c6 Sure, this place is grandiose
8244c6 But to a dragon, it's just gross
8244c6 Time we make the lot all disappear
8244c6 Reality you need a dose
8244c6 To all these ponies, you're too close
8244c6 You just can't be a dragon here
8244c6 Good job, my boy! But this is still just the beginning!
8244c6 Each and every dragon has a swagger all his own
8244c6 Watch and I'll show you what I mean
8244c6 You can't move like this with so much stuff to weigh you down
8244c6 A dragon always keeps it lean
8244c6 Lose this! This! Ooh, this is nice!
8244c6 Your life is soft, your scales are coiffed
8244c6 These pillows, beds, and sheets are washed
8244c6 A delight, but it's just not right what's underneath
8244c6 Every dragon must be free
8244c6 Look at you, then look at me
8244c6 Since when do dragons brush their teeth?
8244c6 Ha! Please!
8244c6 Sure, this place is grandiose
8244c6 But to a dragon, it's just gross
8244c6 Time we make the lot all disappear
824005 What do I do?
8244c6 [Sludge]
8244c6 Just grab it all and give to me
8244c6 After that, then you'll be free
8244c6 You just can't be a dragon heeeeere!
824005 Ha! You're right! I feel better already!
8244c6 See? What did I tell you? You're very lucky that I found you. Now, go get me some more.
824005 You got it! I'm gonna go get you all the cushy pony stuff I've got... Dad.
8244c6 Great! Go get 'em... son!
8244c6 'Cause this dragon just can't wait to live here
824000 [sinister laughter]
824000 [knocking on door]
824000 [door opens]
824003 Spike? I just thought I'd check to see if you and Sludge had any luck turning up your dragonishness. It's hard not to feel like somehow I let you down all these years.
8244c6 [grunting]
824003 Oh! I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to barge in on ya!
8244c6 [grunts, sighs] Ah, don't worry about it. Mi castle es su castle.
824003 Right. Well, I'll just get out of your way.
824000 [door closes]
824000 [squeak!]
824000 [splattering]
824003 Oh! Spike! I'm so sorry. My morning is not going well. What is all this? Why'd you leave the castle so early?
824005 I didn't leave. I spent the night outdoors to get in touch with my dragon side.
824003 Outdoors?
824005 Yeah! And Sludge asked me to bring him the best breakfast Ponyville has to offer so he can show me how a real dragon would eat it. See you later!
824000 [door closes]
824000 [doors open]
824003 ...And that's why I thought we could use the map to—
824005 Hey, gang! Dad was just showing me how a real dragon would act in a throne room.
8244c6 Dragons like to sprawl when they get their claws done. [blows] Now, if you'll all excuse me, it's time for my bath.
824005 [sighs] Isn't he the best?
82400d I'm not sure that's exactly the word I would use.
8244c6 Uh, Spike? The bath isn't gonna fill itself, son.
824005 Be right there... Dad.
824003 I'm glad you're not spending the night outside again.
824005 Oh, I am. I'm just looking for a good bedtime story to read to my dad first.
824003 It's nice that you have somepony to show you dragon culture. But are you sure that's what Sludge is doing?
824005 What do you mean?
824003 Well, taking over your room, making a mess of things...
824005 [scoffs] That is dragon culture.
824003 You never acted like that.
824005 That's because you raised me. Now I finally have a chance to see how I'm supposed to be.
824003 I don't think you're supposed to be any different than who you are.
824005 Maybe you just don't like that I have a real parent now.
824000 [cracking]
824003 That's not true! I'm glad Sludge is here. I-I just wish he wasn't such a—
824005 Dragon? Of all ponies, I can't believe you would have a problem with that.
824003 [sighs]
824000 [splashing]
824000 [bushes rustling]
824186 What happened to you?
824005 Just sleeping outside like we're meant to. It's not like dragons are supposed to live in castles.
824186 I... guess not. But I live in the school. Nothing says we have to live outside.
824005 [sighs] I'm so confused. It's been great having Sludge show me how to be a real dragon, but Twilight just doesn't get it.
824186 What do you mean?
824005 She can't handle how good at being a dragon Sludge is. Maybe someday, I'll be able to lay around doing nothing as well as he does.
824186 What?
824005 Well, not now, of course. I'm too busy bringing him pony stuff so he can show me what a dragon would do with it.
824186 So, Sludge just lays around while you wait on him claw and tail? Uh, dragons are rude and rebellious, but they aren't lazy lumps who take advantage of their kids.
824005 Huh. Now I'm really confused.
824186 Me, too. Why don't you tell me everything Sludge said about being a dragon?
824000 [door opens]
8244c6 [chewing noisily] Hey! What's going on, son?
824005 Twilight doesn't like having real dragons in the castle, so I told her we're moving out.
8244c6 [coughs] You what?!
824186 Spike! I found the perfect cave where you two can live! There aren't even any comfortable rocks inside!
824005 That does sound perfect!
8244c6 No, it doesn't! I-I-I mean, uh, I'm not sure I fully demonstrated all the ways a dragon would live here.
824005 But we're not gonna live here anymore, so it doesn't matter.
8244c6 It matters to me! [stammers] I want to make sure you have all the knowledge you need.
824005 But I do. Dad, you've already shared so much.
824000 [singing] This bed is much too soft
824000 Just take that silk robe off
824000 We can't be dragons living here
8244c8 [straining]
8244c6 Stop! I'm not your father!
824005 What?
8244c6 I just said that to get in on this sweet castle life.
824005 So... you... pretended to be my dad?
8244c6 Now-now-now-now-now, don't look at me like that, kid. I did what any dragon would do.
824186 No. You didn't.
8244c6 Hey. I saw an opportunity, and I took it. That's what dragons do.
824186 No. It isn't.
8244c6 You know what? I don't need this. I'm out of here! Enjoy lovin' pony town!
824005 [sighs]
8244c6 I'm taking this pillow.
824005 I can't believe I thought somepony like that could show me how to be anything.
824186 Uh... it must be hard growing up not really knowing who you are.
824005 That's the thing. I know exactly who I am. And how I got that way.
824000 [door opens]
824005 Um, Twilight?
824003 Oh. Hi. Where's your father?
824005 He's gone. Turns out he wasn't what a real dragon should be after all. He also wasn't my real dad.
824003 Oh, Spike. I'm so sorry.
824005 I'm the one who's sorry. You were just worried about me, and I lost my temper. Sludge was just a great big phony.
824003 I have to say, I'm not surprised. There's no way a dragon like that was related to you. But if you still want to search for your real family, I'd understand if you spent more time in the Dragon Lands.
824005 I don't think so. I already know who my real family is.
824003 Aww! It's me, right?
824005 Mm-hmm! Besides, there's no way I'm living without pillows.
824000 [credits]
825000 [thud]
82513d [groans]
825485 Thank you for the mail delivery. Have a wonderful day!
825485 You're new here, right? I'm Cozy Glow, Professor Sparkle's friendship assistant. Welcome to our school! Your first class is just down that hall.
825485 A seven-letter word for "teamwork". Have you tried "synergy"?
825185 That's it! Thanks, Cozy!
825485 What are friends for?
825000 [door opens, closes]
825485 Good morning, Professor Sparkle!
825003 The mail's here already? What time is it?! I'm late for my class's field trip to Cloudsdale! [panting]
825485 Don't worry. I asked Professor Rainbow Dash to cover for you.
825003 And she said yes?
825485 Uh-huh. I told her how busy you are and how much her loyalty meant to you. I also color-coded your teaching schedule by friendship element and catalogued all the magical artifacts in the school. I hope that's okay.
825003 Okay? Cozy, that's amazing! You're like my right-hoof pony! I don't know what I'd do without you.
825485 [giggles] It's like you taught me. Helping is what friendship's all about.
825003 Exactly. And hopefully my class is learning that on their field trip right now.
825485 I heard they might do some sightseeing first.
825000 [thunder and lightning]
82500c Ta-da! The Pegasus Weather Factory! Every drop of rain or flake of snow from Cloudsdale comes from there.
825000 [sounds of awe]
82500c I know, right? Hey! The cool stuff's over here!
825189 Wow! I've never stood on a cloud before!
82527c You can't normally. But for our trip, I cast a spell that lets us walk like Pegasi.
825000 [wind whistling]
825184 Hey, Yona! Come check out this view! Unless you're too scared.
825187 [teeth chattering] Yona not scared! [screams] Now Yona scared!
825000 [students gasp]
825000 [theme song]
825187 [screams]
825000 [magic fizzles]
82527c [gasps]
825000 [ponies and creatures gasping]
82500c Come on! We gotta catch 'em!
825000 [ponies screaming]
825187 [screams]
825184 Gotcha!
825189 It's okay, Yona! You like flying, remember?
825187 Flying, not falling!
825000 [thud]
825187 [kissing sounds]
82527c I don't understand. It-It's like my spell stopped working. That's... never happened before.
825000 [door opens]
82527c We have an emergency!
82500c The students dropped out of the sky!
825003 Slow down. What happened?
82527c I cast a spell for our field trip to Cloudsdale, but my magic just failed.
82500c We barely caught everypony in time!
825003 I'm glad you're all okay, but I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, Starlight. Maybe you did your spell wrong. Let's take a look.
825000 [thud]
825003 I didn't drop that book.
82527c [sarcastically] Maybe you did your spell wrong?
825000 [thud]
82500d Ow!
825000 [door opens]
82500e Rarity ran into the door.
82500d [sobbing] My magic is go-o-o-one! I even had to use my hooves to coif my tail!
82500c Still think there's nothing to worry about?
825003 This doesn't make any sense. Magic can't just disappear. Something has to be causing this.
825485 Um, didn't we learn in class about a creature that eats magic? Ter, Tee... Tir-something?
82500e [gasps] Tirek!
82500c Isn't he trapped in Tartarus?
825000 [door opens]
825005 [gagging]
825003 Spike, what's wrong?
825005 [gagging, belches, sighs] Thanks. I've never had a letter get stuck before. It's from Princess Celestia! We've all been called to an emergency meeting in Canterlot! Look!
825000 [magic fizzles]
825003 Pretty sure I know what it's about.
825019 Throughout our city, ponies have been reporting tales of their magic failing. Spells going wrong. Potions not working.
82501a Even raising the moon has become difficult. Are there similar troubles in Ponyville?
825003 We experienced it first-hoof.
825198 It's the same in my kingdom. The Crystal Heart seems safe for now, but I worry if this continues.
825000 [door opens]
8254c9 [panting] Letter for the princess from Star Swirl the Bearded!
825019 Ah! It is even more terrible than we feared! Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
825000 [ponies gasp]
825019 Star Swirl believes the power will drain from our land in three days. First, unicorn magic and spells will fail.
82527c That's what's happening now.
825019 On the second day, creatures will lose their magic abilities.
82500e [gasps] Oh, no!
825019 And finally, magical artifacts will stop working. When the sun sets on the third day, the magic in our world will be gone forever!
825000 [ponies gasp]
825198 But why is this happening now?
82501a That's the worst part. We have no idea.
825003 Has anypony checked on Tirek?
825007 You mean the big, red, scary centaur who eats magic? Why would we wa— Ohhhh. Riiiiight.
825019 If he has found some way to escape his prison or work from within it, he could be responsible for this.
82501a That is the best explanation so far. Somepony should investigate.
825003 We'll go.
82500d Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no. Not without us, you wo— Wait. Did you say "we"?
825003 I've finally learned that it's okay to count on your friends for help. Um, you do want to come, right?
82500c Uh, duh!
825019 Thank you, all. We will search for ways to protect Equestria in your absence.
82501a Be careful. Tartarus has changed since you were there. It now holds many dangerous creatures, and you won't be able to rely on your magic.
825008 With her friends by her side, she won't have to.
825000 [door opens]
825003 Okay. I left you my lesson plan, all my student files, and my annotated syllabus notes. If anything goes wrong, get Celestia.
82527c Got it!
825003 Maybe I should just close the school and send my students home.
82527c [sighs] Would you go save Equestria already?
825005 Okay. Cozy packed us all up for a trip to bad guy central.
825485 Don't forget the sandwiches. I marked whose is whose, just in case. [whispering, to Spike] Starlight can't stand mustard.
82527c That's so sweet of you, Cozy. But Twilight has asked me to stay here to run the school.
825485 Oh. I thought that after what happened last time—
825005 Once she's survived Discord, anything else is a piece of cake.
825485 [whimpers]
825003 Plus, she'll have you to help her.
825485 Oh, golly, yes! I promise I'll be the best assistant ever! Come on. We can start working on your substitute headmare plans right now, if you like.
82527c Wow. Uh, okay.
825003 See? Nothing to worry about. Tell me there's nothing to worry about.
825000 [doors open]
825000 [students chattering]
825485 Good morning, friendship students! I know we're all sad Professor Sparkle is away. But don't worry, because she left me in charge to do things just the way she would.
825184 Uh, I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.
825485 She was, but she left me this note. [reading] "I have to go. Twilight needs my help. I know the school is in good hooves with you, Cozy." [giggles] Isn't that sweet? We won't let Starlight down, will we?
825000 [students agreeing]
825186 It's just kind of weird, isn't it?
825485 I don't know what you mean.
825186 Like, why'd she change her mind? Why did Starlight write a note instead of saying goodbye to us herself? Doesn't make any sense.
825000 [students murmuring]
825485 [giggles] Oh, Smolder, you forget. We're not scheming dragons. We're ponies. Sounds like somecreature needs to do a little extra friendship homework.
825000 [students laughing]
825186 [growls]
825187 Yak not pony either! If Smolder get homework, Yona get homework.
825189 Me, too!
825188 I'm in!
825185 Yeah! [laughs] Homework party!
825000 [beat]
825184 [groans] Fine.
825485 What loyalty. Professor Rainbow Dash would be so proud. You are such good friends. You all are. And I'm grateful because it will be awfully hard running a whole school alone. Can I count on each of you to help me?
825000 [students cheering]
825485 Thank you so much! It's just like our professors taught us. Together, we can get through anything!
825000 [Fly-ders buzzing]
82500d [blows]
825000 [smack!]
82500d Ow! Ugh! I have had it with these horrible flies! [whines] I miss my magic!
825003 Have you tried using your tail to shoo them away?
82500d [gasps] Bite your tongue! It's for decorative purposes only!
825007 Hey! I didn't know we packed green cupcakes.
82500e Um, we didn't. They must've gone bad without magic to keep them cold.
82500c "Magic" this, "magic" that. We don't need magic to go on a little hike.
825000 [thunder]
825000 [rain falling]
82500d You were saying?
825008 You just need to think more like Earth ponies, y'all. Granny's "Apple Core No-Bite-No-More"! That'll keep the flies off.
825007 [sniffs] Ugh! It smells just like it looks!
82500e Even if our food's spoiled, these blueberries are still good to eat.
825005 Too bad we can't do anything about the rainstorm.
82500c I can't stop that storm by myself, but I can still help!
825000 [thunder]
825003 I think we have all the magic we need right here. Not that I don't want to get it back. Heh. Let's go!
825000 [students chattering]
825483 Cozy Glow baked our class cupcakes today!
825484 And she made all of us friendship bracelets!
8254ca She's the nicest pony I've ever met. I'm so glad she's headmare!
825188 Uh, temporary headmare? Right, guys?
825483 Oh, oh, of course. But if Twilight takes her time coming back, I won't mind.
825000 [students laughing]
825000 [door opens]
825185 Finally! We thought you forgot about study club.
825188 Sorry I'm late. Cozy Glow gave our class tickets to a Sapphire Shores concert in Ponyville tonight.
825184 You get the feeling Cozy's trying too hard to make us like her?
825189 Or maybe she just wants to help us keep our minds off of how scary it is that magic's disappearing.
825186 I don't trust her. What's she up to behind those big eyes and bouncy curls?
825000 [clattering]
825187 And why Cozy pony coming out catacombs so late at night?
825184 Let's go ask her.
825003 This is the only door to Tartarus. The good news is the seal isn't broken, so we know Tirek didn't escape.
825008 Let me guess. You got bad news, too?
825003 Last time I was here, I had to use magic to get in. And according to Star Swirl, all unicorn magic was gone by yesterday's sunset.
82500c Maybe he was wrong.
825003 [grunts]
825000 [magic fizzles]
825003 [sighs]
825007 Don't worry, Twilight. I got this.
825000 [knock, knock]
825007 Free pizza delivery!
825000 [beat]
825007 Huh. Always worked before. Oh, well.
825008 Did any of y'all pack somethin' that could actually help?
82500d These all do magic, but not the kind we're looking for, I'm afraid.
825005 How about this?
825003 The Key of Unfettered Entrance! Where did you find this, Spike?
825005 In your bag. Cozy Glow must've packed it for you.
825003 She really did think of everything.
82500e Um, what does it do?
825003 It can magically open any door. And since artifacts like this haven't lost their power yet...
825000 [whirring]
825000 [gears clicking]
825000 [cranking sounds]
825000 [shatter!]
825003 I guess it only works once.
825000 [door slams]
825000 [cockatrice hisses]
8254c7 [gasp]
825008 Cockatrice!
82500d Do something, Fluttershy!
82500c Don't look at it! It'll turn you to stone!
825000 [cockatrice hisses]
825007 I don't feel like stone.
825000 [boing, boing]
825007 Unless it's really bouncy stone.
82500e I think he lost his magic, too. All the creatures here must have.
825000 [low growling]
825003 Star Swirl said that would happen on the second day.
825005 I know it should make me feel safer, but it just makes me sad. We gotta fix this!
825000 [door opens]
825000 [chair creaks]
8254a3 Where is Princess Twilight?!
825485 Oh, golly. She's away on a quest. I'm watching the school for her.
8254a3 Magic is failing across our land, and she left a foal in charge of this facility?
825485 Yes, sir! Is there anything I can do for you?
8254a3 That won't be necessary. Twilight's folly stops here. As of now, I am headstallion. And I have quite a few changes to make.
825007 If all these monsters lost their magic, then getting past Cerberus should be easy-peasy!
825000 [loud thudding]
82500c Look out!
8254c7 [scream]
82500e I'll talk to him.
8254cb [growls]
82500e Um, excuse me, puppy?
8254cb [snorts]
82500e You're a very good guard dog. Yes, you are. But, um, we were wondering if we could get by to check on Tirek.
8254cb [slurping]
825008 That looks like a yes.
825000 [splash!]
82500d I'll get you a towel, darling.
82500e [giggling]
82526d The Princess of Friendship here for a visit. What have I done to earn the honor of your company?
825003 We want answers, Tirek. Magic is disappearing from Equestria.
82526d I know. What a waste of such... [slurping] ...mmmm, delicious power.
82500c So you are behind this!
82526d Silly filly, if I had all of that magic, you think I'd still be locked up in here? But I might know something about it...
825485 What are you doing?! Those are Twilight's student files!
8254a3 These aren't. Not anymore. With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together. Twilight has endangered us all by skipping off on friendship trips while these dangerous creatures run loose.
825485 You don't think they're the reason magic is disappearing, do you?
8254a3 Yes, and I came to warn Twilight. But since she is gone, it falls to me to protect you foals from these monsters.
825183 [murmuring]
8254a3 Did you hear something?
825485 It sounded like it came from over there!
825000 [door creaks]
825183 [grunt]
8254a3 You again. As I suspected.
825000 [magic surging]
825183 [scream]
8254a3 From now on, this school is pony-only! As nature intended.
825000 [door opens]
825000 [thud]
8254a3 Since you refuse to explain your plot against Equestria and return the magic you stole, you will stay here while I summon your guardians to take you home.
825188 Wait! You were right about them from the beginning, Chancellor. I see that now.
825186 What are you saying?!
825185 Sandbar?!
825188 I don't want anything to do with creatures that could threaten Equestria!
8254a3 Wisely put, colt.
825000 [magic surging]
8254a3 Everypony will come to their senses eventually.
825000 [door closes]
825000 [thud]
825000 [thud]
825000 [multiple thuds]
82500a [yawns]
825000 [clatter!]
82500a What in tarnation?!
825188 Sorry. I ran out of apples. I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble. Chancellor Neighsay locked them up.
82500a Huh? I thought Cozy Glow was in charge.
825188 Not anymore. But you guys are good buddies. If you can convince her to distract Neighsay, I can break out my friends. Will you help me?
82500a Do mulberries have seeds?
825000 [beat]
82500a That's a yes.
825003 Where is Equestria's magic going, Tirek? What's making it disappear?
82526d If you let me out, I'm sure it will jog my memory. What do you say? I scratch your back, you scratch mine?
82500c How about you tell us what you know or you'll be stuck here forever, because we're out of magic keys and nopony can open the door?
82500d Oh, dear. I hadn't thought of that.
825005 We're just as trapped as Tirek?
82526d [chuckles] What a pity. Well, for you. Sweet revenge for me. It seems my little protégé's plan worked after all.
8254c7 [gasp]
825008 Which little protégé?
82526d Oh, we've never met. We're pen pals. Each letter had so many questions about draining magic.
825007 And you answered them?!
82526d I was bored. So I simply pointed my pen pal in the right direction.
825000 [thud]
82500e Can't you just tell us your pen pal's name? I mean, since we're stuck here anyway?
82526d Oh, why not? The irony is too perfect. Her name is...
825188 Cozy Glow! I-I could've sworn I saw her come down this way when she left her office.
825000 [clang!]
8254cc [gasp]
825485 Enjoying yourself in there, Starlight? I'm sorry I had to push you in. But what else could I do? You were going to ruin all my plans.
8254cc [gasp]
825485 You might get some company soon, if I can't make that annoying Neighsay back off! [inhales, exhales] All this magic needs time to drain from Equestria before my vortex sucks it to another realm. [giggles] Three days can sure seem like forever, huh? You know, you ponies got it all wrong. Friendship isn't magic. Friendship is power! With Twilight and her lackeys out of my way, all of Equestria will bow to me! The future Empress of Friendship! [maniacal laughter]
825000 [to be continued]
825000 [credits]
826000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
826019 Magic is disappearing all across Equestria!
826485 Didn't we learn about a creature that eats magic?
82601a Somepony should investigate.
826003 We'll go.
826184 I thought Starlight Glimmer was gonna be temporary headmare.
8264a3 With Equestria under attack, ponies must stand together.
826188 I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders. My friends are in trouble.
82626d It seems my little protégé's plan worked after all.
826485 The future Empress of Friendship! [maniacal laughter]
826000 [theme song]
826003 Cozy Glow is behind all of this?!
82626d [laughs] I'm not usually a fan of ponies, but draining your precious world of magic so she could trap the six of you was inspiring! [laughs, coughs]
826005 Um, there's seven of us.
826003 I knew we shouldn't have left!
826008 But Starlight's in charge at the school. If anypony can stop Cozy Glow, it's her.
82626d Cozy Glow outsmarted the six of you! I doubt this Starlight stands a chance! [coughs]
826003 We have to get out of here. Her students can't handle Cozy on their own.
82600c Then I guess we'll just have to bust our way out! [yells]
826000 [clang!]
82600c [groans] That didn't work. [groans]
82600d Not everything can be solved with brute force. We need magic to escape.
826007 Maybe there's a way to get out without magic. Like a secret lever or a secret button or a secret admirer who knows a secret about you but is all, "Your secret's safe with me because I put it in Tartarus and I have a key!"
826003 I'm afraid not. The most powerful villains and monsters of all time are trapped here. And without our magic, so are we.
8264cb [whimpers, slurps]
826003 Unless... These creatures might be losing their magical powers, but there's still a magic that makes up what they are. Maybe we can borrow some of that.
826000 [cockatrice hisses]
826000 [knocking on door]
826000 [door opens]
826485 Uh, excuse me? Um, Chancellor Neighsay?
8264a3 You might as well get used to calling me Headstallion Neighsay. I plan to be here for quite some time.
826485 Gee, it sure is a relief to have somepony in charge, what with the magical crisis going on. And we're all so grateful to you for taking care of those... non-ponies. But doesn't the EEA need you?
8264a3 What the EEA needs is somepony to protect this school from the threats at Equestria's borders instead of gallivanting off on adventures beyond them.
826485 Twilight didn't just run off willy-nilly. She left me in charge. I'm her right-hoof mare!
8264a3 Another in a long list of mistakes the Princess of Friendship has made. Rest assured, from now on, this school shall be run according to strict EEA guidelines.
826000 [door opens]
8264a3 The way it always should've been.
826485 Well, that sounds just peachy—
826000 [door closes]
826485 ...Headstallion Neighsay.
826066 Cozy Glow did all of this? How? Why?
82600a I don't know. But come on, y'all. We gotta get Starlight out of there before she comes back.
826188 Wait!
826000 [shimmering]
826066 [screams]
826065 Sweetie Belle!
826066 Help!
82600a That's gotta be what's suckin' up all the magic in Equestria.
826188 But if that's true, then Twilight and the others went to Tartarus for nothing. And if all of Equestria's magic's getting sucked up in there, there's no way for them to get back!
826065 We need to get help!
826066 But Starlight's trapped here, and there's no way to get word to Celestia or anypony else!
82600a I guess we're on our own.
826184 [grunting]
826000 [door rattling]
826000 [thud]
826186 Still locked, huh?
826184 We gotta at least try to get out.
826189 Why? If Sandbar's turned his back on us, every other pony probably has, too.
826187 Sandbar not turn his back! Sandbar is our friend!
826186 Uh, did you miss the part where he said he didn't want anything to do with us?
826185 Maybe he just said that so one of us could be free to snoop around and figure out what's going on.
826000 [lock unlatches]
826188 I dunno. That sounds too clever for a pony to come up with.
826187 [gasps, laughs] Yona knew Sandbar was still our friend!
826066 We all are.
826065 Except for Cozy Glow. That pony is not who we thought she was.
82600a She's the one draining magic out of Equestria!
82647f What?!
826188 We'll explain on the way. But right now, we gotta get to get to Chancellor Neighsay.
826184 Huh?
826188 I know he doesn't like non-ponies. But if we tell him what's going on, he'll help.
8264a3 I am sure you are all concerned about the magic situation. But I want to assure you that this institution is safe, despite the absence of your headmare. As your new headstallion, let me be the first to say that the reign of Princess Twilight is over! From now on, this school will adhere to EEA doctrine, as it should have from the start!
826000 [students murmuring]
826485 [claps] Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay, for that rousing speech. I know you're a stallion who truly believes what you say. And when you say this school will be run according to EEA doctrine, I know you mean it. And when you say there won't be any more lessons from the Princess of Friendship at the School of Friendship, I guess you mean that, too.
826000 [students murmuring]
8264a3 That's not exactly what—
826485 But Twilight decided to run her school outside of the EEA guidelines. And even though you tried to stop her, Princesses Celestia and Luna trusted her enough to support her.
826000 [students murmuring]
8264a3 Well, I-I wouldn't say that—
826485 So, since I know you mean what you say, my question is really for the students. Are we going to give the pony who already tried to wreck Twilight's school once another chance to do it?
826000 [students dissenting]
826485 I guess things will have to stay the way Twilight wants them. Which includes leaving me in charge.
826000 [students shouting]
8264a3 This—! I can—! Just—!
826000 [door opens]
826188 Okay. So maybe we need a new plan.
826000 [chains rattling]
826485 Oh, oh, not too tight. We don't want to hurt the Chancellor.
826000 [padlock clanking]
826485 I'm sure Twilight will know what to do with him when she gets back. Now, back to class, everyone. We let the EEA disrupt our friendship studies long enough.
826000 [doors close]
8264a3 [grunting] Why are you doing this? I thought you wanted to have somepony in charge of the school.
826485 Oh, I do. You just aren't the pony I had in mind.
826000 [clank!]
826485 I can't very well have the EEA running the school if I want to run it myself. Of course, that's just the beginning. You see, if there's one thing I've learned here, it's that friendship is the most powerful thing there is. And as headmare of the School of Friendship, nopony will have more friends than me! Making me the most powerful pony in Equestria! [maniacal laughter]
8264a3 [gulps]
826000 [door opens]
826485 [giggling evilly]
826065 Hey, Cozy Glow! What's so funny?
826066 Are you just happy to be running the school?
826485 Oh, I'm just keeping Twilight's seat warm.
82600a Still, it's pretty impressive.
826066 Is there anything we can do to help?
826065 We can hang out with you all day if you want.
826485 You know, there is something I need help with.
826080 [cheer]
826000 [door opens]
826000 [thudding]
826000 [rattling]
8264a3 Oh, wonderful. I suppose you've all come to gloat?
826185 Actually, we've come to undo all these chains and free you!
8264a3 But... But why?
826187 Now that nasty pony met even nastier pony, maybe nasty pony not be so nasty.
826000 [screech!]
826000 [chains rattling]
826000 [crash!]
826188 Also, we'd kind of like to stop Cozy before she drains all the magic from Equestria.
8264a3 She's behind that as well? I must get word to Celestia and Luna.
826188 How? Without magic, it'll take forever to get to them.
8264a3 While it's true that unicorns have lost their ability to cast spells, the most potent magic in Equestria is housed in our... artifacts. The EEA medallion allows me to travel throughout Equestria. Its magic worked when I chained you up. Perhaps it still has enough to send me to the princesses.
826000 [magic surging]
826189 I hope he makes it.
826186 I hope he doesn't come back and lock us up again.
826184 If he comes back.
826185 Everything's gonna be fine! Twilight and the others are probably already on their way!
8264cb [growls, whimpers]
82600e Um, are you sure there's magic in Cerberus? Clarissa the pig has two tails, and while her singing voice is lovely, I don't think it's magical.
826003 We need to try everything if we want to get out of here.
826007 I don't know. Tartarus isn't so bad. I could hang out here for a while!
826000 [flames roaring]
826000 [crunch!]
826007 Eh. Maybe not forever though.
82626d But that is just what it will be! If my protégé has followed my instructions, by sunset tonight, every last vestige of Equestrian magic will disappear into the ether forever!
826003 Have you even thought about what losing magic would mean?
82626d It means the six of you will be trapped here! Like me!
826005 Seven!
826003 Exactly. It means you're trapped here. Forever. With us.
826000 [beat]
82626d Uhhhh... I hadn't thought of it like that.
826005 So, what do we do, Twilight?
826003 Dash and Applejack nearly have Cerberus tired out. If Rarity pitches in, I think they can get him to sit still long enough to try what I have in mind.
82600e I'm sure I can get the other monsters to help. [whispering, to Spike] Besides, I would never call them monsters.
826005 What about Tirek? He's probably got some magic, too, right?
826007 Leave him to me.
82600d [to Cerberus] Down!
8264cb [low growl]
82600e Okay, everyone! Time to show Equestria that you aren't monsters! You're wonderful, mystical creatures!
826007 Pinkie Pie:
826007 I know it's not your birthday, so
826007 You get a party, even though
826007 We'll sing and dance from one to ten
826007 And then we'll do it all again!
826000 [blows] More tea, Princess Pudding Rock? [high-pitched voice] "Oh! Don't mind if I do!" [laughs] I can do this all eternity.
82626d Fine! I'll help you leave! Just please stop!
826007 Tirek's in!
82600a It's just so excitin' to have a foal our age runnin' things. We should have an ice cream social every day!
826485 That's a splendid idea, Apple Bloom. But to tell you the truth, the thing I need help with most is cleaning.
826066 Say no more. Just take us around the school and show us everything you want cleaned.
826485 Well, actually, you could start right in here.
826065 It looks pretty clean already.
826000 [door slams]
826485 Do you three think you can fool me?! I know a diversion when I see it!
826000 [rocks crumbling]
826187 Uh, why pony lead us back down here?
826188 We obviously can't handle Cozy on our own. But we can't just sit around and wait for help. So, there's one more prisoner I think we should free.
826185 Ooh! I guess Starlight! Is it Starlight?
826187 Counselor pony, come out! We need help with nasty pony!
826188 She can't talk to us from in there. We'll have to figure a way to get her out.
826184 Hey! This is just like chapter twelve in "Kanthaka's Facts and Artifacts" from Twilight's class!
826000 [beat]
826184 What? I've been studying. Finals are coming up, you know?
826189 Actually, I remember that, too! Cozy must've linked these artifacts to act like a mystical magnet, attracting all the magic in Equestria into that orb.
826186 So, we can shut it down by yanking one of these things out, right?
826189 Sure, though that would probably cause a magical feedback loop and destroy the whole school!
826485 Destroy the School of Friendship?! Oh, dear! Chancellor Neighsay was wrong about a lot of things, but I guess he was right about all of you!
826003 All right. Is everypony ready?
82600d [to Cerberus] Sit! Good! [to Twilight Sparkle] I can't say for how much longer.
826000 [cymbals crashing]
826007 All eternity!
82626d Yes, by all means, please! Just get on with it!
826003 [clears throat]
826007 There's your cue, you evil centaur, you.
826000 [magic surging]
826003 [grunting]
826000 [magic zap]
826003 That's it! I think it's working!
826000 [doors creaking]
826003 Come on! I don't know how long I can hold it!
82600c [to Cerberus] Good boy!
82600e [to creatures] Bye, friends. Hopefully, we'll be able to turn you all back into your normal, wonderful selves soon.
826007 [to Lord Tirek] Thanks for the assist, your redness!
826000 [zoom!]
826000 [doors creaking]
826000 [thud!]
826007 Yay! Twilight did it!
826003 I couldn't have done it without all your help.
82600d I'm not sure we did!
826003 No!
826008 Tirek said all of Equestria's magic would be gone at sunset.
826003 Without magic, there's no way we'll get back to the school in time!
82600e What does that mean?
826003 It means... we've failed!
826485 After everything Twilight's done for you, why would you want to destroy her school?
826184 We don't! You're the one using these artifacts to drain magic from Equestria!
826485 Me?! We all just saw you with your claws all over them! [gasps] It all makes sense. These creatures want magic gone from Equestria because it's the only thing ponies have that they don't!
826189 Technically, there's a magical component when Silverstream and I transform.
826187 And Yona's friends' friendship is magic! Twilight said!
826485 And you repay her by sending her to Tartarus on a wild goose chase so you could destroy everything she built! [gasps] They've even trapped Starlight in that-that thing! We have to defend this school!
826000 [students shouting]
826188 No! No, don't listen to her!
826000 [Young Six and students shouting and grunting]
826000 [thud!]
826184 [screams]
826186 Gallus!
8264b9 [grunting]
826000 [cracking]
826000 [vortex swirling]
826483 They just sacrificed themselves trying to save their friend. Professor Dash always said there's nothing more loyal than that. Shouldn't we try to save them?
826485 They brought this on themselves. There's nothing we can do.
826484 That doesn't seem very generous. Or kind.
826485 Yeah, yeah. The Elements of Harmony are very important. They're just not applicable in every circumstance. And with magic gone from Equestria, I'm not even sure the Tree of Harmony will be as helpful as it once was.
826000 [shimmering]
826485 What's happening?!
826484 They're glowing like the Elements! I think the Tree of Harmony saved them!
826184 Guess our friendship is pretty magical after all.
826189 Hurry! Grab the artifacts!
826185 Um, didn't you say that could destroy the school?
826189 But if we don't try, we could lose magic forever!
826188 You all better get clear!
826000 [students screaming]
826485 Wait! Where are you going?! Stoooooop!
826000 [magic surging]
826000 [boom!]
826000 [thud]
826000 [teleportation zap]
826000 [students panicking]
826000 [teleportation zap]
826187 [laughs] Counselor pony—!
82627c Uh, it's nice to see you, too.
826189 I guess magic is back.
826485 You've ruined everything! Now Twilight and her ridiculous friends can escape from Tartarus!
826000 [teleportation zap]
826485 I mean... Yay! All my friends are safe!
826008 You can drop the act, Cozy Glow! Your pen pal Tirek told us all about how he helped you suck up all that magic!
826003 But I still don't understand why.
826485 [growls] Why?! Because friendship is power! You might be the Princess of Friendship, but as headmare of this school, I can collect even more friends than you!
826000 [students murmuring]
826003 You're the one who doesn't get it, Cozy. Friendship is powerful, but power isn't why you make friends. I'm sorry I couldn't teach you that.
826184 Well, you taught us.
826185 You can't let one bad apple make you think you failed.
826188 And we never could've stopped her if we hadn't learned what you taught us about friendship.
826485 Honesty? Loyalty? Generosity? Blah-blah-blah! I can make more friends without using any of them! And if I can't do it here, I'll do it somewhere else!
8264ca Yeah... I don't think so!
8264a3 [sighs] I'm glad you're back in charge of the School of Friendship, Princess.
826000 [door opens]
8264a3 It's clear to me now that there is nopony better suited for the job.
826005 [belching]
826003 What's going on?
826185 Hi, Headmare Twilight! We're just practicing for graduation!
826005 [belching]
826003 Graduation?
826184 Now that we've saved Equestria, we figure we're done with school.
8264cd [laugh]
826003 Saving Equestria is nice, but I'm afraid it'll take more than one semester to learn all there is to know about friendship.
826005 [belches] Told ya.
826183 Awwww...
8264a3 Your headmare is right. I thought friendship was something only ponies should share with each other. But you all taught me how wrong I was. I suppose true friendship can take a lifetime to understand.
826003 If it were easy to learn, we wouldn't need a school.
826000 [crash!]
82600a [yelps] We held her off as long as we could!
826065 But she locked us in this closet!
826066 What happened?! Is everything all right?! Where's Cozy Glow?!
8264ce [laugh]
826003 Everything worked out just fine.
826019 As for Cozy Glow, I can assure you — where she's going, she won't be causing any more trouble.
8264cb [whimpers]
82626d Of course it's boring here now! But at least you're not in a cage!
826000 [magic surging]
826000 [clang!]
826485 Hey, neighbor. Wanna be friends?
826000 [ominous music]
826000 [credits]
901003 [panting]
90100e Oh, good. We're all here.
901003 So everypony got an urgent summons to the castle with no explanation?
901007 Yup! I just love a good mysterious summons. What's it about? Do you think it's a surprise party? Hey! Why are we running?
901003 Because something could be terribly wrong! Somepony turned bad? Another evil creature back for revenge?!
901008 Don't you think you're bein' a little paranoid?
901003 Why else would the Princesses send scrolls in such a hurry?
90100d Good point. They know better than to make us worry.
901007 Plus, I like it when you run so fast, the walls get all blurry! Wheeee!
90100c Race ya!
901000 [bouncing]
901000 [door opens]
90100d [panting]
901005 [yelps]
901019 Girls. Thank you so much for coming.
901003 What's wrong?! What can we do?!
90101a That's just it. Nothing's wrong! Everything's perfect!
901008 Did y'all call us down here just to tell us that?
90100d With all due respect, majesties, you might want to save your urgent summons for matters that are a bit more... well, urgent!
901268 [giggling]
90101a Well, there is more to it. Equestria is currently enjoying its longest period of harmony in recent years.
901019 And it's all thanks to you, Twilight. And your friends, of course.
901005 Who, us?
90100d Oh, pshaw. [giggles]
90100c It's about time you noticed!
901003 Thank you!
90101a Because of your efforts, there's been less and less for us to do.
901019 So, after much consideration, my sister and I have decided it is time for us... to retire!
9014c7 [gasp]
901000 [poof]
9010db Breaking news! The royal princesses retiring! I have so many questions! Who'll take over? Who will run Equestria? Will it be someone tall, dark, and handsome? Or will it be the Lord of Chaos?
901000 [magic zaps]
901000 [beat]
9010db Oh, fine. Go with the obvious choice.
901003 [panicked noise]
901000 [theme song]
901003 You're retiring?!
901005 Princesses can retire?
90101a [chuckles] Of course we can. I for one am looking forward to a little R&R. Maybe a trip to Silver Shoals.
901003 And you want me to take your place?!
901268 Mm-hmm!
90101a With the help of your friends, of course!
901019 We can't think of anypony more worthy. Over the years, we've watched you grow. You've faced task after task...
90101a ...challenge after challenge...
9010db Countless adversities, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it...
901019 And you've always prevailed.
901003 Thank you, but that doesn't mean that I'm— that we're ready to do what you do!
901019 Oh, of course you are. I realize this is a lot to take in, but—
90100c Nope! Makes perfect sense. We're awesome! [gasps] Does this mean we get all your powers?! Ooh, ooh! I call dibs on showing up in everypony's dreams!
901003 You can't be ready to step into their horseshoes just like that!
901008 Well, if the princesses think it's time to retire, we're not a bad choice. We always have Equestria's best interests at heart.
901003 That's a fair point... which should be taken into consideration when we have a round table discussion—
90100d Well, I'm in! Darlings, we'll all need a complete wardrobe update! And I would love to pick your brain about mane maintenance when you have a moment.
90100e As long as we all have each other, I'm sure we can do it!
901007 Yay! "Protectors of Equestria" on three! One... two...
901003 [sighs] If you're all on board, I guess I am, too.
9014c7 Protectors of Equestria!
901003 It'll be a bit of an adjustment, but I imagine the transfer of power will be a lengthy process, which will—
901019 Actually, we just need a few days to put together a little ceremony.
901003 [nervous laugh] A few days?!
901025 [groans]
901003 But that's so soon! Shouldn't there be some sort of training program that lasts weeks? No, months? If not years?!
901019 Everything you've gone through over the years has been a training program.
901003 Okay, but there's gotta be a guide or a rulebook!
9010db Yes, I have it right here. "How to Rule Equestria", by Nopony McPretendsmith.
901000 [beat]
90101a The friendship journal you wrote yourselves is a better guide than any we could provide.
901003 [hyperventilating]
901019 We have the utmost confidence in you.
90101a And we hope you have the same in yourself.
901003 [still hyperventilating, hyperventilates into paper bag]
9010db Oh, I'm absolutely certain she does.
901003 I am not confident about this at all!
9010db Well, that's what I thought. I was being sarcastic before.
901000 [spray bottle noises]
9010db What? This is all so predictable. Now's the part where you all tell little Sparkle here that everything is going to be fine, but she won't believe you. Ugh. I don't need to be here for this.
901000 [poof!]
901003 It's just... I know I said yes, but then they said "in a few days", and there's still so much to figure out! It's all happening so fast! [hyperventilating into paper bag] I think I need some— [sips water, gulps] Okay! I'll feel much better—
90100d —once you make a plan?
901003 Oh, wow. It's like you—
901005 —knew you were going to react this way? We did.
901007 Classic "Twilight-ing".
901003 "Twilight-ing"? You... You made me a verb?
901008 It's not a bad thing. We just know you have a... process.
90100c Stage one – you get big news and you're like "Nooooo!", but then you pace, and you chart, you worry...
90100e It's okay. You go ahead and "Twilight", and we'll be here for you.
901003 You're all acting so calm! But this is a big deal! What do we do if something big happens and the princesses aren't there to help?!
90100c Um, if you think about it, they literally almost never help.
901000 [beat]
901008 Huh.
901007 And we still always win! Like when Sombra almost took back the Crystal Empire, or when Chrysalis pretended to be Cadance, or when Tirek came back and absorbed all the magic, or the other time Chrysalis tried to take over, or with Cozy Glow and the school! [inhales] Am I missing anything?
90100d Pony of Shadows.
901005 Starlight when she was evil.
90100e Discord when he was evil.
901008 Do Flim and Flam count?
90100c See? We've almost always done things without the princesses' help! Which makes sense now, because it was all just training for you to take over!
901005 And it worked! I mean, if you think about it, there hasn't been a single villain that we couldn't defeat.
901003 Phew!
90119c One day, you'll see! I will defeat Twilight Sparkle and her friends! [cackles] And they will pay for stealing my kingdom!
901000 [magic zap]
901000 [whoosh]
901000 [scraping]
901485 Psst, Tirek!
90126d It is Lord Tirek. And what is it now?
901485 I just wanna make sure you can see my best friends rock sculpture from over there!
90126d [groans]
901000 [whooshing]
901000 [crumbling]
901000 [drip]
901000 [magic noises]
901000 [whirling]
90119c Lord Tirek!
90126d A changeling? [to Cozy Glow] See? She gets it.
90119c Chrysalis, queen of the changelings! Or at least I will be, when I'm restored to my rightful place! Why did you summon me? What do you want?!
901485 [yelps] Oh, golly! We didn't bring you! I thought you freed us from Tartarus!
90119c Tartarus? Whoever pulled you from there must have been somepony very powerful indeed.
9011a8 [laughs]
90119c King Sombra! You have returned? Why did you bring us here?
9014cf He didn't.
901000 [whoosh]
901000 [thump]
9014cf It was I. You may call me... Grogar.
9014d0 [gasps]
90119c The Grogar?
90126d I thought that you were a legend!
9011a8 I've heard of you.
901485 Who?
9014cf I assure you, I am very real. And you have all been brought here as part of my plan to rid Equestria of Twilight Sparkle and her friends once and for all. [laughs]
901485 I am so sorry, but the name 'Grofar'? It just doesn't ring any bells.
9014cf Grogar! I have been away too long if my name no longer strikes fear into the heart of one so tiny. Perhaps a demonstration of power is in order?
901000 [magic zaps]
90126d [kisses] Grogar is ancient and extremely powerful. The land that would become Equestria was a mere collection of farms and pastures until he declared himself emperor of all he saw. I remember hearing tales of his tyranny when I was young.
9011a8 I have also heard of the first Emperor of Equestria. The "Father of Monsters".
9014cf I gave life to the foulest of creatures and allowed them to run wild, taking what they wanted and destroying the rest. My reign was a glorious, fear-soaked epoch of darkness in Equestria.
90119c Ha! Until Gusty the Great rose up and banished you.
9014cf That fool believed taking my bell would defeat me! But she only weakened me temporarily.
901485 Um, Tirek is really old – [to Tirek] no offense, you look great – [to Grogar] but if he knew about you when he was young, we have super different ideas about what "temporarily" means.
9014cf Silence! I've spent millennia gathering power, biding my time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to seize control of Equestria! And watching all of you. I've seen each of your humiliating defeats at the hooves of six puny ponies. And do you know why they've always bested you?
90119c Because they cheat!
90126d Because they are annoyingly lucky.
901485 I'm just a kid, so...
9014cf It is because they work together. Where one is weak, another is strong, and thus unified, they are a formidable force! But we shall use their own strategy to defeat them.
90119c What are you suggesting?
9014cf I suggest nothing. I demand that you join me, and together, Equestria will be ours!
9011a8 I don't do "ours". I only do mine. I will take back the Crystal Empire on my own, and I will destroy any pony who gets in my way!
9014cf Such confidence. Go! Try to take back your kingdom. I shall send you there myself. If you prevail, you may keep it. But when you fail, you will submit to me!
9011a8 And if I refuse this deal?
9014cf Then I shall return you to the darkness from which you were summoned.
9011a8 Fine! But this is a waste of time, as I will crush those who defy me. I will defeat all who get in my way! I'm—
901000 [whoosh]
9014cf I advise the rest of you to prepare to work together!
901485 Well, working together sounds an awful lot like making friends, so... you two are in luck, because I know all about that!
901000 [twang]
901000 [knocking]
90127c Twi! You in here? With the school closed for the summer, I didn't think anypony would be here—
901000 [paper rustling]
901003 So much to do, not enough time! No! I already did that! Wait, no, I didn't! Uggggh, not enough time!
901005 [hushed] Help! She's spiraling! We're at the "my plan needs a plan" stage of a total Twilight meltdown!
90127c [hushed] Oh, got it. [normal] Twilight?
901003 Did I write down "eliminate redundant lists" on my School of Friendship to-do list or my personal to-do list?
90127c Twilight!
901003 Gah! Starlight! Oh, good, you're here! I need to talk to you.
90127c Okay...
901003 Hang on, I had "talk to Starlight" written down on one of these. Just let me find it so I can cross it off! [worried noises]
90127c Wow, you are "Twilight-ing" hard.
901003 You say "Twilight-ing", too? Well excuuuuse me! This is the first time I've ever been asked to run a whole kingdom!
90127c Uh, you're right, you're right. [chuckles] So, what did you want to talk to me about?
901003 Ah, here it is! I wrote it down. [reading non-stop] Starlight, you have blossomed into one of the strongest, smartest, most caring ponies I know, and I can't think of anypony better to leave in charge of my castle and the School of Friendship! So what do you think?
90127c What?! You want me to take care of the castle and run the school?!
901003 Yes?
90127c Uh... I can't! I'm not ready! Remember what happened the last time you left me in charge?! And now you want me to do it permanently?! What if I don't do the right things?! [hyperventilates] What if—?!
901003 Starlight, get a hold of yourself! You've risen to every challenge you've ever faced. You can do anything you put your mind to. You've got this.
90127c Hah! And so do you. See what I did there? You just said everything you need to hear.
901003 [sarcastic laugh] Nice try. But running a school and running a country are two very different things. Now, if you don't mind I have seven thousand, four hundred, and thirty-two things to take care of before I become the new ruler of Equestria! [hyperventilates, hyperventilating into paper bag]
901005 It was a valiant effort.
901000 [Crystal Ponies screaming]
901000 [crystals cracking]

901193 The guard says Sombra's breached the castle!
901198 Hurry, Twilight! We need you!
901000 [poof!]
901198 Do you have Flurry Heart?
901193 I thought you had her.
9011a5 [gasp]
901000 [door opens]
901319 Mama!
901198 [gasps] You won't get away with this!
9011a8 Oh, but I already have.
901319 [angry noises]
9011a8 [laughs]
901000 [crystals cracking]
9011a8 With the Crystal Heart now in my possession, there is nothing to stop me from ruling the Crystal Empire!
901000 [chains clinking]
9011a8 Kneel before Sombra! [sighs] Long live the king.
901000 [door opens]
901003 Thanks for coming so quickly—
901000 [magic zap]
9014d1 [gasping]
9010db Sure thing. But if you're gonna be the ruler of Equestria, you may want to work on your penmanship. This looks like it says, "Cadance sent an emergency message. Sombra's back, and he's taking over the Crystal Empire."
901003 That's exactly what it says!
90100d But... But how is that possible?! I thought the Crystal Heart had dispelled him into the ether!
901003 I have no idea! But he's back, and it's up to us to save the Empire and my family!
90100e Shouldn't somepony tell Celestia and Luna?
9010db Ooh, good point! One of us should probably loop in the real rulers of Equestria.
901003 No. If we're going to run Equestria, we'll need to handle things like this on our own.
9010db Oh, Twilight! Could this mean that you finally have the confidence to ascend to the throne like the princesses believe you can?
901003 Maybe? Unless you'd consider taking care of Sombra for us?
901000 [beat]
9010db Oh, no-no-no-no! You're absolutely right! You need to learn how to handle these things on your own. Ta-ta!
901000 [magic zap]
901008 Handlin' things on our own is all well and good, but last time we defeated Sombra with the Crystal Heart.
901005 What if he has it already? How are we gonna stop him?
901003 [gasps] With the Elements of Harmony! With those, we can defeat anypony! Even Sombra!
9010db Ah, no-no-no. You didn't need the Elements the last time you defeated Sombra. And I'm not sure that using them still counts as "handling things on your own".
901003 My family is in danger. I'm not taking any chances.
90100c She's got a point.
9010db Ugh, fine.
901007 What's his problem?
901003 Starlight, can you stay here and-
90127c [cutting off Twilight] -take care of the school? I've got you covered.
901000 [teleportation zap]
901000 [magic twinkling]
901000 [teleportation zap]
9011a8 [chewing]
901000 [magic zap]
9011a8 It's cute that you think that will do anything.
901198 It might not, but they will!
901007 Cavalry's here! [grunts]
9011a8 [chuckles] How can I be surprised when I'm waiting to show all of you your greatest fear?
901012 [gasp, groan]
901000 [clanks]
901003 Oh...
901019 Oh, Twilight. How disappointing.
90101a Equestria was in your care, and you let it be destroyed!
9011a8 You should all surrender! Nothing can defeat your own fears!
901000 [magic sounds]
901003 We didn't need to defeat them. We just needed to face them long enough to distract you!
901000 [crystal cracking]
9011a8 Nooooo!
901000 [magic zap]
901193 [mockingly] It's cute that you think that'll do anything.
901000 [magic zap]
901000 [explosion]
9011a8 [growls] You may have won the battle, but I shall win the war!
901000 [magic zap]
901005 Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
90100c We totally just wiped the castle with that guy!
901193 Thanks, Twily.
901007 That was fun!
901008 And easy.
90100d As magical battles go, that was a cakewalk.
901007 Mmm... Cakewalk...
9010d4 [giggle]
901003 We did handle this pretty well. On our own.
901005 Does this mean...?
901003 I still don't feel like I'm one hundred percent ready, but will I ever?
901008 Knowing you? Nope.
901003 I have you guys, and we have the Elements. And together, we've never failed. We'll be okay.
9014d2 [assorted cheering]
901003 Once again, Equestria is safe.
90100e What should we do to celebrate?
901007 I vote for a cakewalk!
901000 [rumbling]
901008 What's goin' on?
901003 I don't know!
901000 [cracking]

902019 It is time for us... to retire!
902003 And you want me to take your place?!
902019 With the help of your friends, of course.
9024cf You may call me... Grogar. Together, Equestria will be ours!
9021a8 I will take back the Crystal Empire on my own!
902005 How are we gonna stop him?
902003 With the Elements of Harmony! With those, we can defeat anypony!
902000 [rumbling]
902000 [shattering]
9021a8 [laughs evilly]
902000 [theme song]
9021a8 [laughing maniacally]
90200c What. Just. Happened?!
90200e The Tree of Harmony can't really be gone, can it?!
902003 It can't be!
9021a8 But it is! You thought you defeated me, but you led me right to the source of your power. Now that it's destroyed, nothing can stop me!
902000 [clinking]
902003 He's right... With the Elements gone, I don't know how we can defeat him!
90200c Then we'll just have to beat him the old-fashioned way!
902000 [clinking]
902000 [magic zap]
902000 [crunching]
902003 [grunts]
902000 [magic zaps]
902003 [straining]
9021a8 Ha! You're no match for me! I will finally rule the Crystal Empire! [gasps] Wait... With you out of the way, I will rule all of Equestria!
902003 No!
9021a8 Oh, yes. And I think I know exactly where I'll start.
902008 Don't you dare say it!
9021a8 Your sweet, little hometown.
90200d You leave Ponyville alone!
9021a8 Or what? Without your Elements, it would be so easy to control you.
902000 [magic noises]
902012 [yelps]
9021a8 But there's no point. My conquering Ponyville is already your greatest fear! [laughs maniacally]
902012 No!
90200e What do we do?!
902003 I don't know! The Tree of Harmony grew the Elements! It kept the Everfree Forest under control! And now it's gone. Sombra will take over Equestria, and it's all my fault! I knew I wasn't ready to take the princesses' place, but I never thought I'd mess up this badly!
902000 [beat]
902007 What are you looking at me for?
90200c This is usually when you say something funny to lift our spirits.
902007 Sorry. Nothing about this is funny to me.
90200d [tears up] I'm sorry. I'm trying to be strong, but I just can't bear to think about poor Sweetie Belle under the spell of that monster!
902007 Or those sweet little Cake twins...
90200c Or Spike, or Starlight...
90200e Or Angel... or anypony forced to do that monster's bidding!
902000 [splat]
902008 What the—? Twilight, what are you doin'?
902003 We can't just stay here. I don't have a plan, and I don't know what I'm gonna do once we get out. But we can't sit here and let Sombra make slaves of everypony we love!
90200c Let me help! I'm faster!
902000 [digging]
902007 I like digging!
902000 [whrring]
90200e I've been known to get my hooves dirty!
902008 Move over, y'all!
90200d Normally, I wouldn't dream of digging, but right now, show me the muddy!
902000 [digging]
902000 [whirring]
902012 [gasps]
902008 Apple Bloom! It's me! Look at me, sugarcube! Twilight, you gotta free her! Please!
902000 [magic noises]
902000 [magic zap]
902003 [yelps] I... I can't! Without the Elements, my magic isn't strong enough to stop Sombra's! Spike! Spike, where are you going? Starlight?
90227c [monotone] We must lay siege to Canterlot.
902003 No! Snap out of it, you two! You're stronger than his magic!
90200d Sweetie Belle, please stop! I can't get her to stop! I can't get her—!
902003 None of us can. We can't reach them!
902007 [screams]
902000 [thud]
902007 [sobbing] He made them bake a black licorice fruitcake that says "Congratulations to Our Favorite Supreme Emperor King Sombra" in green frosting! It's the ugliest cake I've ever seen! [sobbing]
90200c Twilight, this is bad! Like, really bad!
90200e [sobbing] I've never been so sad in my whole life!
902003 I don't know what to do! I don't know how to free them, but I don't know how to stop Sombra! Everypony was so sure I'd do such a great job! Well, this is exactly what I was afraid of! Could anything else possibly go wrong?!
902007 Well... With the Tree of Harmony gone, the Everfree Forest could grow out of control and threaten the town!
90200d Darling, that's oddly specific.
902000 [crackling]
902012 [gasp]
902000 [crackling]
90200e [gasps]
902003 Even if we figure out how to defeat Sombra and bring everypony back to Ponyville, if we don't stop the forest, there won't be a Ponyville to come back to!
902000 [whoosh]
90200c Ahem.
902000 [clicking]
90200e For our friends!
902043 For our families!
902030 For our home!
902003 For Equestria!
902000 [crackling]
902012 Equestria!
902000 [whoosh]
902006 [inhale]
902000 [magic zaps]
9021a8 You! Break it down!
902000 [thuds]
902000 [crash]
902000 [door opens]
9021a8 They've fled! Celestia and Luna are too cowardly to even stand against me! Equestria is mine! [laughs maniacally]
902012 [grunting]
902000 [magic zaps]
902000 [chopping]
90200e Come on, everypony! [shrieks]
902000 [crackling]
902000 [animals squeaking]
902008 We've been at this for hours, but it's just growin' back too fast!
902003 We have to keep trying!
902000 [crackling]
902000 [magic zaps]
902012 [gasp]
902008 I know we're supposed to be able to handle things on our own, but I've never been happier to see two ponies in my whole life!
902000 [teleportation zap]
9024d3 Nopony is meant to handle this on their own!
902003 Star Swirl! The Tree of Harmony, it's—!
9024d3 I know. I alerted the princesses as soon as I could. I felt it when it happened. Like part of my essence just ceased to be.
902003 I know what you mean. I'm sorry.
9024d3 Don't be. I've more than enough magic in me to keep the Everfree Forest under control.
902003 You can do that?
9024d3 The Pillars and I planted the Tree of Harmony. Who do you think kept the Forest under control before it did?
902000 [magic zaps]
9024d3 It will take time, but with the princesses' help, I can keep it at bay!
902000 [magic zaps]
90200c Aw, yeah! Go get 'em, beardy!
902000 [magic zaps]
902003 Sombra's back, and he's taken control of all of our friends!
90201a We've left Canterlot defenseless!
902019 Twilight, you must go! Defend Equestria, and we shall contain the forest.
902007 At least now we're back to just one problem!
902000 [teleportation zap]
902000 [teleportation zap]
902012 [shrieks]
902007 Aw, everypony's all evilly!
90219b [growls]
90200e Sombra's gonna force us to fight our way through our friends?!
90200c Not if I can help it!
902000 [whoosh]
90200c [gasps]
902000 [magic zaps]
90200c Okay, guess we need a different plan. Twilight?
902003 I don't know! I'm not prepared to fight against the citizens of Equestria! I guess that's one more thing I'm not ready to do...
902008 Well, we'd better figure out somethin' quick, because none of them seem to have a problem with it!
902000 [drawbridge lowering]
90200d [shrieks] Oh, sorry about this, Fancy Pants!
902008 We promise we'll let y'all out as soon as we can!
902000 [whooshing]
90200c Ooh, will I go here? Or here? Or here, or there?!
90200e [pants] Huh?
902000 [ding!]
902000 [whoosh]
902000 [smack!]
902003 [gasps]
90200c Gotcha!
902000 [whoosh]
90200e I don't know how long we can hold them off!
902008 And holdin' them off isn't what we need anyhow! We need to get inside!
90200d But we can't just leave them here, all possessed and Sombra-fied!
902007 What do we do, Twilight?!
902003 I don't know, but we can't stay here!
902000 [teleportation zap]
902003 I'm sorry we couldn't help our friends, but I didn't know what else to do.
902008 At least we're inside.
902007 [unconvinced] Yeah! All we have to do now is defeat King Sombra! [nervous laugh]
902003 I... We...
902000 [splat]
9020db [chewing] Oh, my. No Elements? No princesses? Seems like you're in a bit of a pickle! Or are you in... [snaps] ...more of a jam? [chewing] Mmm!
902003 Discord! What are you doing here?!
9020db [swallows] Well, I was going to hang these up all over the castle to celebrate your coronation, but apparently it's a bit premature.
902000 [pop]
902003 I'm so glad to see you! We could really use some all-powerful Lord of Chaos help right now!
9020db Moi? Oh, I couldn't possibly.
902000 [trotting]
902007 Oh, poodles!
902003 Discord, please!
9020db Oh, fine. [snaps] Just to be clear, I was really rooting for you to do this on your own and parlay that confidence boost into being the best protectors of Equestria you can be.
90200c A little less talking and a little more helping?!
9020db [snaps]
902000 [splat]
902000 [door opening and closing]
902000 [splats]
90200e [gasps] Thank you, Discord!
902003 I don't know what we'd do without you!
902000 [magic zaps, crystals cracking]
902000 [door opens]
90200c Okay, "King" Sombra! Time to give up the crown!
9021a8 [laughs] Here to fight the good fight with nothing but your wits? Admirable, but foolish! [grunts]
902000 [splat]
9021a8 [grunts]
9020db Well, I guess it's on me to be the MVP today. I was betting on you, and I do hate being wrong. Although if you think about it, I am your friend, so maybe you win because friendship wins? Although Fluttershy should get most of the credit for that. She's my favorite.
9021a8 [grunts]
9020db [slow motion yell]
902000 [thud]
90200e [gasps] Discord!
902015 [gasps]
9021a8 [laughs] Not even the Lord of Chaos can stand against me! I am truly the most powerful creature in Equestria!
902000 [magic zap]
90200c Discord!
902003 We need you!
90200e [tearing up] Oh, please wake up, please wake up... [gasps] Discord!
902003 I'm so glad you're okay! We can't beat him without you!
9021a8 You couldn't beat me with him, either! [laughs]
9020db [coughs] [weakly] It would appear that you're on your own. [ragged breath] [snaps] I have nothing left to give.
902008 That's it, then? We're doomed?
9021a8 Of course you are. I can't believe it's taken you this long to realize it. Now, how shall I eliminate all this clutter in my throne room?
902012 [growl]
9020db [weakly] Listen to me. You don't need me. You don't need the princesses, and you certainly don't need the Elements. [coughs] Fluttershy, you will always be kind. Applejack, you will always be honest. Rarity, you'll always be generous. [ragged breath] And Rainbow Dash will be loyal as can be. Pinkie will always bring laughter wherever she goes. And Twilight... [coughs] you are and always will be the embodiment of magic. You lost sight of what's in front of you. You're here, together, willing to give everything you've got for Equestria. Nothing and nopony can ever take that away from you, because that's who you are.
9021a8 [laughs] It's going to take more than a sentimental speech to save you.
902003 Discord's right. We've proven time and time again that the real magic is the six of us working together! With these girls by my side, I'm not afraid of you! I'm not afraid of what you can do or how much power you have!
9021a8 You should be.
902000 [magic zap]
902003 You may knock us down, but we're gonna get back up again!
902000 [magic zap]
902003 And again!
902000 [magic zap]
902003 And again! As long as we're together, we will never stop trying to defeat you!
902000 [magic zap]
902003 [straining]
90200e For our friends!
902043 For our families!
902025 For our home!
902003 For Equestria!
902000 [magic noises]
9021a8 [grunts] No! This can't be possible! Your magic can't defeat mine! I destroyed the source of your power!
902003 You can't destroy our friendship, Sombra!
90200c And we keep telling bad guys.
902008 But y'all just don't seem to remember.
902012 Friendship is magic!
902000 [magic explosion]
9021a8 Noooooooooo!
902000 [crystal cracking]
902000 [boom]
902000 [door opens]
90200e Aw, do you want more juice?
9020db [weakly] Only if it's not too much trouble. And it's red. And it has one of those little umbrellas. And two cherries. No, no, actually, make it three. And maybe, uh... some donuts?
902019 I see you've made yourselves at home.
902003 Celestia! Luna! I know what you're going to say. I should have called on you as soon as I knew how dangerous it was. A good leader knows when to ask for help, and I didn't. And because of me, the Tree of Harmony was destroyed. Equestria deserves somepony much better than me as its leader.
902019 You're right.
902003 [sighs]
902019 About one thing. A good leader knows when to ask for help, but a great leader has the courage to admit when they've made a mistake and the strength to make it right. Today, you've proven to me beyond any doubt that you will be a great leader.
902003 Will be?
902019 Luna and I have decided it may have been a bit unfair to thrust this upon you without giving you the time you need to prepare.
902003 [sighs] Thank goodness! I really wasn't ready!
9020db Not ready?! So, Twilight's not taking over?! This was all for nothing?! I pretended to be very hurt and gave one of the most convincing speeches of my—?!
902084 Pretended?!
9020db Of course! You don't think some "would-be king" could actually hurt the Lord of Chaos, do you? Anyway, as I was saying, I pretended to be very hurt to convince you that you didn't need anything but yourself to be the incredible leader I know you can be. And now it's not happening?!
902019 It will. But when she's ready.
9020db How can she not be ready?! What a waste of a perfectly wonderful speech! Ugh! Honestly, I don't know why I even bother.
90200d Ugh! So he could have ended the whole Sombra thing whenever he wanted?
90200e But he didn't, because he cares.
90200c That's Discord for ya.
902008 He sure has a weird way of bein' supportive.
902007 Super odd dude.
902000 [magic zap]
9020db I heard that!
902000 [magic zap]
9024d4 [laughing]
90201a Also, truth be told, Celestia and I had fun today fighting side-by-side with Star Swirl for our home. It's been years since we've gotten to do what you girls do. You all make it look so easy.
90200c Well, we are kind of an awesome team.
90200e Every adventure is heart-pounding, but so rewarding.
902007 I'm up for anything, as long as it's with all of you!
90200d [giggles] Life certainly hasn't been dull since we met.
902008 Nowhere else I'd rather be.
902003 We are pretty incredible together. And we would do anything for Equestria. I guess I know, when the time comes, as long as we're together, we probably—
902025 [clearing throats]
902003 We definitely got this.
902025 Awww!
902485 Now I'll say something nice about centaurs. Tirek, you say something nice about changelings. And Chrysalis, you say something nice about ponies!
90219c Never!
9024cf Let us hope the three of you will be enough for my plans.
90219c And what of King Sombra?
90226d Did he succeed?
9024cf Hah!
902000 [magic noise]
9024cf I'd say he gambled and lost! But at least he can serve as a warning to those who doubt continuing with my plans. Unless any of you have doubts.
90226d Uh, not I.
90219c Nope!
902485 I'm good!
9024cf Then we shall join forces and work together to bring Equestria to its knees! [laughs]
9024d5 [nervous laughter]
902000 [credits]
903000 [zooming]
903000 [thud!]
90300c Congratulations, Silverstream! You're officially the first non-Pegasus Wonderbolt!
903185 Really?! That is such an honor! I don't know how to thank you, Professor Dash!
90300c Easy! You're kicking off our show right now! So get up there and make me proud!
903000 [whoosh!]
903185 Wait! I don't have my uniform!
903189 Silverstream! Somehow, I missed a class all year, and the final is today! If I don't pass, I can't graduate!
903187 [screaming]
903000 [beat]
903187 [sighs]
903189 Whoa. That was weird.
903185 And that's even weirder.
903186 [sips, sighs] Hmm? Uh, this isn't mine!
903184 [screams] Make it stop! Make it stop! [hyperventilating] Huh?
903188 [panicked noises]
903000 [magic sounds]
9034c1 Good. You have all answered my summons.
903185 Wait. You mean this isn't my dream?
903187 Friends must be dreaming together!
903184 More like a nightmare!
903188 I know, right? How do I pick just one? They all look so good!
903186 That's your version of a bad dream?
903189 But why did you bring us here, Headmare Twilight?
9034c1 I am not Twilight. I am merely the messenger. You all must hurry. The Tree of Harmony needs you.
903000 [smash!]
903000 [magic sounds]
903183 [gasp]
903000 [theme song]
903000 [squeaking]
903005 [clicks tongue] Lookin' good.
903000 [teleportation zap]
903003 Spike! I have horrible news!
903005 What's wrong? Is the Crystal Empire under attack again?!
903003 What? No! We only have twenty highlighters! And they're all orange! How will everycreature color-code their notes?!
903005 I'm pretty sure you're the only one that does that.
903003 Still, twenty isn't enough for the new school year!
903005 We got plenty of time to order more. The friendship students won't be back until—
903000 [doors open]
903005 Uh, now?
903187 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
903000 [thud]
903003 Well, this is a surprise. Why are you all here so early? Did I send out the wrong back-to-school date?!
903186 Oh, we're not here for school.
903188 Yeah. We're back 'cause the Tree of Harmony called us here.
903003 [gasps]
903184 Don't feel bad it didn't reach out to you. We kinda have a special connection with it after last year.
903003 But the Tree couldn't have called you. It's gone! Sombra destroyed it!
903183 [gasp]
903005 Mmmmaybe next time, ease in with those truth bombs.
903188 W-What about the Elements of Harmony?
903003 Those are gone, too.
903189 But doesn't that mean the Everfree Forest will take over Equestria?!
903005 We've got that part under control, and Sombra won't be coming back, so... some good news, right?
903185 Can we see the Tree ourselves? Or what's left of it?
903003 As long as you promise to stick together. The Castle of the Two Sisters isn't the safest place, as you may remember.
903187 Yona not scared of puckwudgies anymore! Friends save whole school from evil Pegasus!
903005 [aside, to Twilight] She does have a point.
903183 [laughing]
903189 Yes!
903183 [gasp]
903184 How could this happen?!
903189 [gasps] If only we hadn't gone home for summer break. Maybe we could've saved the Tree.
903186 [huffs] I wish that Sombra guy was still around, so we could teach him a lesson!
903187 That not bring back Tree. Or Elements of Harmony.
903185 [gasps] Wait! We all saw and heard the Tree in our dream, right? How could it talk to us if it was really gone? Maybe if we close our eyes and think really strong friendship thoughts, the Tree will get better!
903186 Eh, I've heard worse suggestions.
903000 [music]
903000 [beat]
903188 [loud whisper] Is it working?
903187 No.
903189 I guess the Tree really is gone.
903184 Then we need to do something to honor it!
903186 Ah, good idea, Gallus!
903188 Hey, maybe that's why the Tree called us! It must've used the last of its magic to make sure we'd come here and keep its memory alive!
903189 It did say it needed us.
903361 Ocellus!
903000 [transformation noise]
903000 [thud]
903361 There you are! The hive has been worried sick! Why did you leave without telling us? The last time you and your friends did that, it almost brought our kingdoms to war!
903000 [transformation noise]
903189 Uh, sorry, Thorax! It was an emergency!
903361 Well, next time, ask before you run off. Now, come on. Let's go home.
903186 Wait! She can't leave! We have a... dragon quest!
903361 But she's not a dragon.
903000 [transformation noise]
903361 You know what I mean.
903000 [transformation noise]
903187 This quest for all Yona friends! Need to help Tree!
903188 And it might take a while.
903185 Can we stay, Headmare Twilight?
903003 Well, as long as you get permission from your kingdoms, I suppose it's all right.
903184 You want that permission in triplicate, or is one enough?
903000 [beat]
903184 What? I like to be prepared.
903000 [dragons yelling]
903186 [straining] Yah!
903000 [dragons cheering]
903186 [laughs]
903000 [montage music]
903187 [snorts]
903000 [knocks on door]
90329e [coughs]
903000 [door slams]
903000 [music continues]
903000 [inaudible dialogue]
903188 Hey, you're back! Great! Since I live locally, I figured I'd do a little cleaning up while you were gone. Give us a head start, you know?
90347f [gasp]
903184 Sandbar, where's the Tree?
903188 I got rid of it, to make room for a memorial.
903186 You did this?!
903188 Uh, yeah. That's what you guys were thinking, right?
903186 [smack]
903185 So not.
903189 How can we remember the Tree if it's totally gone?!
903188 Oh, it's not gone. Look! I planted a new tree. [grumbles]
903189 Sandbar, you know that's not the same tree, right?
903188 But it's a symbol, y'know?
903187 Pony heart in right place.
903184 [growls] That doesn't matter! This cave was supposed to stay exactly the same so that future creatures could come visit and experience the memory of the Tree!
903188 Sorry, everycreature. I thought I was helping.
903186 The Tree of Harmony is a huge part of Equestrian history. If we're gonna honor it, we need to do better than that.
903185 Yeah! Like with lots of artwork that represents the symbolism and deep emotions of the Tree!
903184 No! It should be a museum with all the Tree's history and artifacts.
903186 Or a really big and imposing monument, so everycreature knows how powerful the Tree was!
903189 I think we should turn this cave into a place for creatures to reflect on the Tree's true gift – the Elements of Harmony.
903186 Boring.
903185 I like my idea better.
903188 What's more perfect than another tree?!
903189 What would Headmare Twilight want?
903184 Yona! You've been awfully quiet. Which idea do you like best?
903187 Yona like when friends not argue. M-Maybe friends listen to each other and... make plan together?
903000 [beat]
9034a0 Naaaah.
903187 [groans]
903188 [to sapling] Hey, little guy. Need a drink?
903000 [water sprinkling]
903184 Step right up! Walk this way! Welcome to the one, the only, magical Tree of Harmony Museum! Come, see the birthplace of the Tree! Grown from the tears of a basilisk and tended day and night by pony magicians! This is truly one of the wonders of Equestria!
903187 Uh, Gallus? None of that actually true.
903184 So? Honoring the Tree means giving it a story that creatures will care about.
903188 It already has a great story!
903184 Yeah, but mine makes more sense.
903188 Whatever. Can you just keep it down? My sapling doesn't like the noise.
903184 Good! It doesn't belong in the Tree's memorial anyway. [to tourists] And if you think this is great, just wait until you see the mystical Cave of Harmony!
903000 [scraping]
903186 [straining]
903000 [thud]
903000 [crunch]
903000 [whoosh]
903187 What dragon doing?
903186 [straining] Making a memorial statue of the Tree. When creatures see this, they'll be super impressed!
903187 Uh, look like rock, not tree.
903186 I'm not finished yet! And, honestly, I'm kinda having a hard time remembering what the Tree looked like. I can't believe I'm already forgetting.
903000 [painting noises, splats and splashes, etc.]
903185 Hmmm... Needs more loyalty.
903000 [splash]
903185 Careful, Yona! It's not dry yet.
903187 What hippogriff painting?
903185 It's the Tree, silly! See? These are the emotions its loss made me feel, dancing with the representations of Elements of Harmony!
903000 [beat]
903185 Maybe I should label it.
903000 [creaking]
903000 [splash]
903189 Oops! Sorry!
903185 Oh, no! Brown isn't an Element of Harmony!
903000 [splashing]
903189 [straining] Thanks, Yona! This fountain is heavier than I thought.
903000 [thud]
903000 [wind chimes]
903000 [transformation zap]
903189 It's for creatures to look at as they honor the Tree's memory in quiet thought and contemplation. I got some help and guidance from the counselor at our feelings forum back home. Only positive energy will bloom here.
903184 Wait! You can't go yet!
9034d6 [gasps]
903184 There's a whole puppet show of the time the Tree tested us in the catacombs under the School of Friendship! [to Smolder] Hey, stop! You can't bring that hunk of junk into my museum!
903186 It's not for your museum. It's for my tree memorial.
903184 So leave it outside!
903186 It belongs in here!
903000 [crunch]
903000 [crash]
903000 [splash]
903185 [gasps]
903000 [rumbling]
903187 [gasps]
903000 [crash]
903184 Uh-oh.
903185 [gasps] What did you do?!
903000 [water flowing]
903189 My meditation garden is ruined! Why couldn't you've been more careful?!
903184 This never would have happened if you had all just listened to me!
903188 And made the Tree some kind of roadside attraction?! Uh, no thanks!
903185 [hyperventilating into paper bag] Headmare Twilight is gonna be so mad when she sees what you guys did to the Cave of Harmony!
903186 Yeah, like some rainbow art project was better?
903188 Not cool!
903185 It's impressionism!
903189 I'm just glad the Tree isn't here to see this.
903186 This is all your fault!
903184 I give up!
903187 [grunts] Quiet! [stomps] Friends doing this the wrong way. All remembering Tree of Harmony for what Tree was, not what Tree is!
903186 You mean 'gone'?
903187 No! Yona mean even though Tree not here here, Tree here. In hearts. Tree made friendship even closer.
903189 That's right! We ran away to be together right above this spot! The Castle of the Two Sisters!
903188 And later on, the Tree tested us to show us we're stronger as a team!
903186 It did call us all here.
903185 [gasps] You mean the Tree of Harmony lives on in our friendship!
903184 Wow. I can't believe we just got schooled by a yak.
903187 Yaks know things not forever. That's why smash and rebuild.
903189 I think we took care of the smashing part.
903184 Then maybe we should start building. Together?
903186 Just one problem. We still haven't decided what we should do for the Tree.
903187 Yona have idea.
903000 [clanking]
903189 The Tree! Where did you find it?!
903188 Oh, I didn't move it too far.
903000 [beat]
903188 It was kinda heavy.
903184 And you're just mentioning this now?
903187 What important is that Yona bring back branches so friends can rebuild!
903186 Rebuild what, exactly?
903185 Ooh-ooh-ooh, I know! Something that represents what the Tree is! The gateway to our friendship!
903187 Yes! What ponies call it? Club... home?
903184 A treehouse!
903189 [gasps] That's a great idea!
903186 I know the Tree would've liked that!
903187 Uh-huh!
903000 [transformation zap]
903188 [straining] Help me lift this piece!
903185 [Silverstream]
903185 We celebrate our friendship
903189 [Ocellus]
903189 We celebrate the tree
903188 [Sandbar]
903188 The memories inside us
903183 [Young Six]
903183 We'll build for all to see
903186 [Smolder]
903186 The tree brought us together
903000 [Ocellus, Silverstream, and Gallus]
903000 (Brought us together)
903186 [Smolder]
903186 And even though it's gone
903000 [Ocellus, Silverstream, and Gallus]
903000 (Even though it's gone)
903184 [Gallus]
903184 Our monument of friendship
903000 [Rest of Young Six]
903000 (Of friendship)
903183 [Young Six]
903183 Can make the gift live on
903189 [Ocellus]
903189 A piece from me, a piece from you
903185 [Silverstream]
903185 We'll use the tree and we'll make do
903184 [Gallus]
903184 If things don't fit, there's lots of glue
903183 [Young Six]
903183 Friends don't quit in the end
903183 And together, we'll see this through
903186 [Smolder]
903186 It's hard to say farewell
903188 [Sandbar]
903188 To something you hold dear
903000 [Silversteam, Sandbar, and Ocellus]
903000 But goodbye isn't forever
903183 [Young Six]
903183 As long as we are here
903183 The tree is in our memory (ahh-ahh-ahh)
903183 Its roots have grown deep in our hearts
903183 (Deep in our hearts, deep in our hearts)
903183 Its branches raise our spirits, together we're all bound
903183 Forever it stands, lost but now it's found
903186 [Smolder]
903186 So lift a beam and build it strong
903185 [Silverstream]
903185 Work as a team, it won't take long
903187 [Yona]
903187 Hey, Silverstream, I think that's wrong
903000 [Silverstream, Gallus, and Yona]
903000 We'll live the dream and sing our song
903183 [Young Six]
903183 And make the tree something all can see
903183 In a place where we belong!
903188 Well? What do you think?
903189 It's, uh... kinda messy...
903000 [bat squeaking]
903186 Yeah... like a bunch of different parts all smushed together.
903185 Oh, it's just like us!
903187 Yona think it perfect!
903184 Let's give it a try.
903000 [thud]
903183 [giggling]
903000 [rumbling]
903188 Whoa! What's happening?!
903189 It looks like magic!
903186 Everycreature out!
903183 [panicked panting]
903000 [rumbling and creaking]
903000 [crunch]
903000 [creaking]
903000 [shimmering sounds]
903183 [gasps] Whoa!
903184 How did that happen?
903000 [glow]
9034c1 Because of you. The spirit of the Treehouse would have perished without your selfless deeds and caring. Whenever you seek solace, come here. Your friendship, and the friendship of future generations, will always be safe within these walls.
903000 [magic zap]
903000 [door opens]
903000 [teleportation zap]
903003 I felt a burst of magic all the way over at the school! Is everycreature okay?
903185 A little confused, but definitely okay!
903003 [gasps] Where did this come from?
903186 We were kinda gonna ask you the same thing.
903005 It looks like part of the Tree of Harmony. But how? I thought it was destroyed!
903189 It was. But when we used the broken parts to build something new, this happened.
903003 The Tree has always been good at surprises. When Star Swirl planted the Tree's seed, he didn't even know what it would grow into. I guess the Tree is still alive, changing and adapting to be whatever Equestria needs.
903184 A cool place to hang out?
903003 Something tells me this is more than that. It seems the Elements of Harmony may still be with us in their own way.
903005 [sighs] That's actually really reassuring.
903185 But why did the Tree need our help to become something new?
903003 I'm not sure. If I had to guess, I'd say your friendship is more powerful than you know.
903187 Oh, Yona know. Yona just need to remind friends.
903005 So, who's gonna give us the tour?
903183 [umm-ing and uhh-ing]
903003 [giggles] Why don't we all go in together?
903183 [laughing]
903000 [credits]
904005 Twilight! Look at this scroll I just got!
904000 [fanfare plays]
904003 [gasps] Do you know what this means?
904005 Uh-huh!
90427c Uh, I don't. What's so exciting about a toy crown?
904005 [laughs] This is no "toy crown". It's the hard-won helm of the Sibling Supreme!
904003 When Shining Armor and I were small, we competed over everything.
904000 [wind blowing]
904000 [montage music]
904003 [voiceover] To keep it friendly, our parents gave us gold stars every time we did something special. Sharing... getting good grades... even telling a really funny joke. And at the end of each week, we'd add up the stars. The sibling with the most would win the Crown of the Sibling Supreme — and bragging rights — 'til next time.
90427c Guess that explains your love of charts and so much else.
904005 I always wanted to be Sibling Supreme one day. [reading] "Meet me at Celestia's castle to decide who deserves the crown once and for all."
904049 Race you there!
904000 [door opening and closing]
90427c Guess I'll watch the school?
904000 [theme song]
904000 [door opens]
904003 [gasps]
904000 [fanfare]
904003 You're wearing it?!
904193 Look, I know you've always held a grudge because I left home with this.
904003 Grudge? [scoffs] What grudge? Just because you've had it for way longer than you should have and I never got a chance to win it back!
904019 With the return of Sombra, Princess Luna and I felt it was time to reinforce the castle's defenses.
90401a I said we could do it ourselves, but some ponies are a bit stubborn.
904019 So I asked our old Captain of the Guard to handle the job.
904193 I've taken the security here to a whole new level. The only thing I need now is somepony to test it.
904003 [gasps] You want me to break into Celestia's castle?
904193 If you can get past my defenses, steal the crown, and get out, you'll be Sibling Supreme forever!
904003 For-ev-er...
904193 But! If you fail, I keep the crown.
904003 Deal! Wait. Are you sure this counts? Mom and Dad aren't giving us any stars.
904019 I will represent their authority. And thank you, Twilight. Your help will reveal if there are any holes in our security.
90401a [nickers]
904193 And there aren't. I've designed a multi-tiered, impenetrable, triple-backed-up line of defense.
904193 [voiceover] The castle is surrounded by shards of Queen Chrysalis' throne. Thanks to Star Swirl, its anti-magic powers are now tuned to stop anycreature from using a spell to get inside. You can't fly in, either.
904000 [fans whirring]
904193 [voiceover] Giant fans keep anycreature from flying too close to the castle.
904000 [bird squawks]
904000 [bricks clink]
904193 [voiceover] Plus, the entrances to the tunnels below the castle have been sealed, so there's no underground access. And even if you could get in — which you can't — I've doubled the ranks of security. Ponies protect every hallway and door, which can only be opened with royal guard medals.
904193 Even if you brought an army, the throne room is the safest spot in Equestria. I rigged a floor trap to activate at the slightest touch.
904000 [ka-chunk!]
904193 But say you avoid the floor — still no luck, because I've employed nature's alarm system.
904000 [geese honking]
904005 Geese?
904193 You can hear their honks all the way in Ponyville.
904000 [goose honks, snaps]
904193 Plus they bite. [nervous laugh]
904000 [goose honks]
904003 So that's what we're up against.
904008 Whew. That's a barrel and a half of obstacles. Plus a bushel and a peck of impenetrability.
90400d And all of this to win some fillyhood competition with your brother?
904003 It's more than that! Okay, it's exactly that. And to protect Celestia's castle!
90400e If it means that much to you, Twilight, we're in.
904007 I was already in! Come on, who doesn't want to hang with geese?!
90400c Of course we'll help. But how?
904005 Shining Armor may have come up with some great security, but he'll never guess Twilight's plan.
904003 We play to our strengths and defeat all of the security measures. That way, if one of us fails, the others will still have a shot at getting the crown. Pinkie, you'll distract the guards with a surprise party.
904007 Yes, sir, Twilight, sir!
904003 Applejack, you'll buck your way into the sealed tunnels. Rainbow Dash, if anypony can outfly those wind turbines, it's you. Rarity, you'll sew us guard costumes so we can sneak past security. Then Fluttershy will disable the throne room alarm by charming the geese.
904005 [belches]
904000 [poof!]
904005 It's from Shining Armor. [reading] "Dear Twily, hope your idea isn't just..." [indistinct muttering] Tunnels? He guessed your whole plan!
904003 What?! Pinkie party, Rarity costumes... "Signed, the future Sibling Supreme"?! Oh, come on! [grumbles]
90400d Twilight, darling, nopony knows you better than your own brother.
904003 So you're saying I should give up?
90400d I'm saying your brother will win. No matter how brilliant your plan is, no matter how many variations you try, it will be something your brother expects, and he'll always win! Unless... when the perfect chance comes along, you do something he can't expect. Then you'll win.
904005 You've been practicing that speech, haven't you?
90400d A little bit. It felt like I rushed. Did I rush it?
904008 Absolutely not.
90400e Oh, no.
904007 Yeah, it was fast-ish.
90400d We have to do the opposite of what Shining Armor expects. Therefore, Twilight cannot mastermind the plan. But I can!
904008 That's... definitely unexpected.
90400c Uh, how is you making a break-in plan the opposite of Twilight doing it?
90400d Because my plan is for each of us to devise our own unexpected part of it. Allow me to demonstrate.
904000 [magic sounds]
904000 [harp flourish]
904000 [indistinct talking]
904000 [film noir music]
904000 [silence]
90400d We're looking for a pony with information.
904000 [zoom!]
90400c We got questions, and you're gonna serve us up some answers, juice jockey!
90400d Where is the secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle?
9044d7 Shining Armor sealed 'em all. There's no secret entrance.
90400d There's always a secret entrance!
90400c So make like a glass of O.J. and spill!
904007 Ooh, ooh, ooh! I know what I can do!
904007 [voiceover] You're gonna need a lookout, so I can be your eye in the sky. [on-screen] Too low, silly! Up here!
904000 [jangle pop music]
9044d8 [laughs] Oh, Pinkie! That tickles! [laughs]
904007 [laughs]
904000 [beat]
904007 What?
904008 How about somethin' a little more down-to-earth? Like, I distract the guard ponies with a farewell performance by my alter ego, famous country-western superstar Apple Chord!
904003 I didn't know you had an alter ego. And why would she be giving a farewell performance?
904008 Well, it's a long story.
904008 [voiceover] Back on the farm, playin' music was about makin' her family smile. Word of her talent spread, and soon, Apple Chord was playin' real shows.
904000 [crowd cheering]
904008 [voiceover] The more she played, the bigger those shows got.
904000 [crowd cheering]
904008 [voiceover] But she missed playin' for her family... So one day, she gave it all up. Seein' her family smile was all she ever wanted from her music.
904008 Of course, Apple Chord could come out of retirement for a farewell concert this one time.
90400c Wait. Did you just make all that up, or did that actually happen?
904008 Um...
90400d Doesn't matter. It's perfect. Fluttershy? Spike?
90400e Well, I guess the opposite of what I'm good at is... [gasps] ...being in small spaces.
904005 I always wanted to be a super-spy. Is that the opposite of anything?
904000 [metal clanging]
904005 Special Agent Fluttershy, target detected below.
90400e It's almost too easy.
904000 [Mission Impossible-esque music]
904000 [laser sounds]
904000 [explosions]
904003 Mm-mm. I guess I'm the only one left that still needs a plan.
90400d [laughing] Oh, no, darling. That is the plan. You shall do nothing!
904003 [gasps]
904005 Shining Armor definitely won't expect that.
904000 [music]
904000 [fans whirring]
904193 Applejack? What are you doing?
904008 Applejack? [laughs] Who's that? My name's Apple Chord, and I've got a couple of songs to play for ya. Clap your hooves if you know 'em! And a one, and a two, and a...
904008 My love is like a barrel
904008 A barrel full of hay
904000 [wind blowing]
904000 [hot air activating]
90400c The Wonderbolts did a fly-by, and the only way past those giant fans and into the castle ducts is here. But there's no room for mistakes!
904007 Just like space travel!
90400e Uh, Pinkie? We're not actually going into space, right?
904007 [giggles] No, silly! I'm dropping you two off as soon as we're close to the fans! Then I'm going into space!
904000 [thud]
904193 You're up to something, Twily.
904003 Nope. Just looking at the flowers. [sniffs, sighs]
904193 [unconvinced] Right.
904003 [sniffs] Ooh! Maybe Rarity's plan will work!
904007 Canterlot! We have a problem! [screams]
904008 I know that one's a crowd favorite. What say we play it one more time? And a one, and a two, and a—
904007 [screaming]
904008 [quietly] A distraction's a distraction.
904003 Where's Spike and Fluttershy? Did they make it into the castle?
904007 They jumped out right before the balloon went [blows raspberries] but that's all I could see without being in space, where I didn't get to go!
904003 Let's hope Rarity and Rainbow Dash had better luck.
90400d What's this? Closed?!
9044d9 Oh, the seedy juice joint is always closed around this time.
90400d Then how are we meant to shake down ne'er-do-wells for information?!
9044d9 What sort of information do you need?
90400c Um, the location to a secret entrance to the passages under Canterlot Castle.
9044d9 You mean that one?
90400d Yes, thank you. That will do nicely.
90400c Zephyr Breeze?!
90400d Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho, darling, this couldn't be more perfect!
90400c How is this perfect?! He's the most annoying pony in Equestria, and he's totally obsessed with me, and we have to come up with a way to distract— Oh, no. Oh, no-no, no way! Unh-unh!
90400c [sighs]
904346 [slurps] Wha...? Rainbow! I knew you'd come running when you heard I got this job! The mares love a pony in uniform, am I right?
90400c Not really. I mean, eh, totally. Why don't you step into the light so I can see how... ugh... handsome you look in it?
904000 [film noir music]
90400d [grunting]
904346 I told the sarge that gold kinda clashes with my aura, but apparently, they aren't big on input. Still, I totally managed to rock the look, don't you think?
90400c Yep. You're real guard material.
904346 I'm part of the castle team now, so I'm basically— Whoa! We got a swooner! [seductively] It's good you're finally being honest with your feelings for me, Rainbows.
90400c [gags] Blech.
904346 The truth is such a gift. Like, I had to follow my bliss to see guarding is my calling. Like, look at me go. I'm gonna walk over here, and I go whoo! Over there! And I go, "Yeah!" and sometimes, I just stand like this and look real cool, and I go down the hallway and go, "Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh!"
904000 [glass scraping]
904005 [gasps, sighs]
90400e [hushed] We'll have to glide to the throne. No flapping.
904000 [goose grunts]
90400e [gasps]
904000 [geese honking]
904000 [trapdoor opening and closing]
904000 [door opens]
90401a [distant] Sister! Another false alarm from Shining Armor's guard geese!
904000 [door shuts]
904003 We should have heard by now! Something must have gone wrong!
904007 Probably several somethings. [inhales, blows air]
904003 No lookout, no distraction, and no word from the ponies inside! I'm starting to think this whole operation might be a giant flop!
904000 [geese honking]
904000 [scratching]
90400e [hyperventilating] Oh, no!
904005 Gee, Fluttershy, I thought your whole small spaces thing was just part of the plan to be unexpected.
90400e Once, I got trapped in the Castle of the Two Sisters, and Angel Bunny and I were separated! Now whenever I'm in a tiny room, it's all I can think about! I was so worried he felt alone and forgotten!
904005 [sighs] I know that that's like.
90400e What do you mean?
904005 I was always excited to be a part of Twilight's and Shining Armor's rivalry, like I was their little brother. But they never really thought of me that way.
90400e I know they both have a special place in their heart for you, but sibling dynamics are hard. Trust me.
904005 Right. Zephyr Breeze.
90400e Honestly, he could learn a lot from you about being a little brother.
904000 [rumbling]
90400d I am sick of being lost in these slimy corridors, too! But you shouldn't pull every lever you come across! Half of them are traps!
90400c And the other half might open a secret passage to the castle!
90400d It's not worth the risk! Oh, hello, Spike. [to Rainbow Dash] Even if we did find our way back to the castle, we'd still have all of those guar— Spike? Fluttershy?!
90400c Uh, what are you guys doing down here?
904005 We, uh, kind of fell through the floor.
90400e I don't think our plan is working.
90400d We've both hit dead ends. Perhaps we should return to the outside and reevaluate.
904000 [mice squeaking]
90400d Eugh!
904003 [hyperventilating]
904005 Psssssst!
904000 [metal squeaking]
904003 What are you all doing out here?
90400d In retrospect, our plan might have been too unexpected.
904003 [gasps] Every part of it failed?! Oh, now I'll never get the crown!
904005 Maybe we should go back to doing things the Twilight way.
904003 You mean the totally expected way?
904005 It may not be a surprise, but you have a pretty good record for planning things.
904003 Then I guess it's worth a try. Thanks, Spike.
904005 What are little brothers for?
904003 Okay! You all know what to do!
904000 [music]
904000 [balloon inflating]
904000 [pop!]
904000 [slide whistle]
904000 [guards chattering]
90400d At least one part of our expected plan worked unexpectedly.
904000 [door opens]
904000 [whooshing]
904346 To be fair, it was never made specifically clear to me what "guarding" actually means, so this is on you.
904008 I'm strong, Twilight, but not even I can buck through solid rock.
904003 That's why I brought a specialist.
904000 [tapping]
904000 [chalk drawing]
904000 [joints cracking]
904000 [crunch]
90400d [deep voice] Next shift. You're on break.
904000 [whoosh]
904000 [thud]
904000 [door opens]
904000 [geese honking]
90400e You've been glaring so hard. Who wants a feather massage?
904000 [gesse quiet]
904005 We mapped this out when we got lost down here. The lever to the secret hallway entrance should be... here.
904000 [click]
90400c I can't believe this worked!
904005 I guess sometimes the best plan is the one you expect!
904003 All I have to do now is fly over and take the crown, and I'll be Sibling Supreme forever!
904193 Not exactly.
904003 Oh, come on!
904193 Gotta admit, it was unexpected for you to do everything exactly how I thought you would. But you should know by now there's no way to beat the true Sibling Surpreme!
904019 I am sorry, Twilight, but it looks as though Shining Armor has truly won the crown.
904005 That's the thing about looks. They can be deceiving.
904003 Spike?!
904193 How in Equestria did you do it?!
904005 Come on. You two don't think you have the only sibling rivalry. I had an inside pony help.
904000 [dramatic music sting]
904005 It wasn't hard to miss there were some disagreements on the whole security thing.
90401a [flashback] I said we could do it ourselves, but some ponies are a bit more stubborn.
904005 [voiceover] So, while Shining Armor went on and on about his improved security measures, Luna and I struck a deal. She put Zephyr in charge of the catacombs and helped keep Celestia out of the castle hallways. Once Luna was on board, I just had to do my part and make sure we stuck to Twilight's plan so we'd all get to the throne room at the same time. I knew Shining Armor would let it play out until the last possible second. Then, while everyone was distracted by his gloating, all Luna had to do was float the crown over to me.
904000 [beat]
904019 [clears throat] [forced] I, uh, apologize, for not listening to your concerns, sister. It seems we need to make adjustments to account for threats inside the castle as well as out. If you agree?
90401a [forced] If you think it's worth discussing.
90400c So, if Twilight and Shining Armor failed, who gets the crown?
904005 [sighs]
904003 The true Sibling Supreme. Spike.
904005 Huh?
904193 The little brother we've always had.
904012 Awww...
904000 [heist music over credits]
905000 [zoom]
905005 Whoa!
905000 [thud!]
905005 Twilight, mail's here!
905000 [doors opening]
905003 [gasps]
905000 [squeak]
905003 Are you all right?
90513d We just had a really heavy delivery today.
905005 Is it a deluxe set of special edition Ogres & Oubliettes figurines that I'm totally surprised by and have been hinting that I need forever?
90513d Well, it's for Twilight.
905005 Awww...
905003 Thank you.
90513d You're welcome!
905003 Huh. It's from Princess Celestia.
905005 [belches] So is this. Really? She couldn't have put it into the box?
905003 [reading] "My dearest Twilight, I have been conducting a thorough cleaning of the castle, and I came across a few items of yours in your old room. I thought you might want them back." I didn't even know I'd left anything! Awww, look! Remember this? It's the macaroni picture frame Cadance helped me make when I was a filly!
905005 [quietly, sarcastic] Who could forget a masterpiece like that?
905003 My G1 Star Swirl figure! And some of my favorite school scrolls! And here's my extra extra credit report on "The Impediments of Using Magic in Everyday Chores"! Ha! Still so true!
905005 Is my Smash Fortune comic in there? I've been looking for that for years. Whoa, whoa!
905000 [thud]
905005 [muffled] Or this.
905003 Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
905005 What's wrong? It just looks like an old library book.
905003 Exactly! It belongs to the Canterlot Library! That means it's... overdue!
905000 [theme song]
905003 You don't understand, Spike! I have a perfect library book return record!
905005 [clears throat] Had a perfect record.
905003 [groans] I've never turned in a book even a minute late! And this one has been overdue since I left for Ponyville!
905000 [stamping]
9054da Make sure you bring this one back on time. We've got a long waiting list of ponies who can't wait to read it.
905003 I promise I won't let you down!
9054da Oh, of course, you won't, dear. If there's anypony I can trust to take care of a book, it's you, Twilight Sparkle. After all, you still hold the "Best Book Borrower" title.
905003 Oooh! I hope I do forever!
905003 Spi-ike! Quick, find me that old copy of Predictions and Prophecies. What's that for?
905005 Well, it was a gift for Moon Dancer, but...
905003 Oh, Spike, you know we don't have time for that sort of thing.
905003 And then Celestia sent me to Ponyville, and I forgot all about this! Dusty Pages prided herself that no books were damaged or lost on her watch, and I failed her! I failed myself!
905005 I take it we're going to Canterlot?
905000 [zip!]
905005 [groans] The sooner, the better, I guess.
905003 [gasps]
905000 [leaves rustling]
905005 Uh, why are we hiding? Don't you wanna return your book?
905003 Yes. But what if somepony sees me in there? I'm the Princess of Friendship. Everywhere I go, ponies recognize me. I'll stick out like a sore hoof.
905005 [incredulously] Princess Twilight Sparkle in a library? Stop the presses!
905003 A late book is a big deal, Spike. What if Dusty Pages revokes my library card? Or bans me from ever entering the building again?!
905005 Don't you already have most of those books in your collection at home?
905003 Yes, but the ones in there have a special Canterlot Library-y smell!
905005 You sniff books?
905003 You don't? I used to live in a library. If I'm not a good example of proper book borrowing behavior, then what kind of princess am I?
905005 One that makes mistakes like everypony else. Trust me. Once you return that book, you'll feel way better.
905003 Thanks, Spike. Let's go! [screams, giggles nervously]
905005 [groans]
905000 [teleportation zaps]
905003 [gasps, clears throat, deep voice] I have a book to return.
9054db Princess Twilight! So good to see you!
905003 [groans]
9054db Need some recommendations from the new release section?
905003 [gasps] Is that the new edition of Mooncurve's Seven Theories on Bending Time? I have been waiting for the release sin— Uh, I mean, uh, no books today! [chuckles] Thanks!
905000 [ponies gasp]
905003 But I do need to speak with Dusty Pages about a... [clears throat] sensitive matter.
9054db Dusty who?
905003 [nervous laugh] Dusty Pages? The head librarian? She's worked here forever.
9054db I'm sorry, princess. I don't know her. Now, was there some other way I can help the library's Best Book Borrower?
905003 [nervous giggle]
905005 [hushed] Just ask where to return an overdue book! It's no big deal! It happens all the time!
905003 [hushed] Not to me it doesn't! [sighs] Fine. Fine! Oh, no! I didn't even think about the late fine! A book out this long will probably cost a thousand bits!
905005 She— I mean, we have an overdue book.
9054db [laughs] Well, that's no problem at all. In fact, it happens all the time.
905005 See?
9054db I'll just find it in the card catalog. Uh, number one-eight-nine-oh-five, got it! [laughs] Oh, wow. Yeesh. I haven't seen a book this late in... well, ever. [clears throat] You need to go and see First Folio in the Grossly Overdue Book Return Office for Ponies Who Should Know Better.
905003 Don't pull any punches with those names, do you?
905005 And that office would be...?
9054db In the basement. [whispering] Because of the shame.
905000 [thud]
905005 Whoa. [strains] Looks like nopony ever goes down here.
905003 Nopony except undependable rule-breakers who deserve all the horrors this hallway holds!
905005 And faithful dragon companions. Uh... hey! It looks like First Folio left a note on the door!
905003 "Abandon hope, all ye who enter"?
905005 [reading] "Out to lunch on Restaurant Row." Guess we'll have to try back later!
905003 No! I can't wait another minute to return this book! In the time it took us to get there, I racked up another... seventeen bits in late fees! We're going to lunch!
905005 Good, 'cause I'm starving! [licks lips]
905000 [beat]
905005 Oh. You mean to find First Folio. Can we at least get takeout?!
905003 Tell me if you see any librarian-type ponies.
905005 Twilight, we tried this at three other restaurants already!
905003 And my late fines are already up another twenty-six more bits!
905005 [mock-sobbing]
9052c9 Waiter, we're ready to order.
905005 Oh, uh, I'm not actually—
9052c9 Three samosas, two curry specials... Do you think that's enough for the two of us?
905005 Hm. Well, I would probably order some naan as well. For the table?
9052c9 Sounds great.
9052be Twilight? Is that you?
905003 Moon Dancer! How've you been? I'm just visiting. No real reason. Heh.
9052be Well, it's good to see you! I'm just meeting my friend, First Folio, for lunch. Do you want to join us?
905003 First Folio?! Yes! I mean, thank you.
9054dc Princess Twilight, good to meet you! Did you know your picture is still up in our library as the Best Book Borrower?
905003 Yeah... I was hoping I could talk to Dusty Pages about that.
9052be Oh, Dusty Pages left the library moons ago. Didn't you know?
905003 Mm-mm.
9054dc Oh, I heard she was forced to leave. It's so sad. She loved the library.
905003 Wait. Forced to leave?
9054dc Yuh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. She had a perfect librarian record. Until one careless pony didn't return a book, ruined it all.
9052be Are you okay, Twilight?
905003 [nervously] Uh-huh. Would, uh, you excuse me?
905000 [whoosh]
905000 [spinning]
905005 That's why you only order spicy if you can take it. Twilight, what's wrong?
905003 Dusty Pages isn't working at the library any more because I didn't return this book! Spike, I think I got her fired!
905000 [brake skids]
905005 Twilight, the library is that way!
905003 Change of plans. We're going to Dusty's house. She used to invite me over for tea all the time.
905005 But what about your late fees?
905003 They're not as important as making things right.
905005 Wait. So you're not going to return the book?
905003 No. Dusty Pages is. It's my fault she lost her job. So if I give her the book, she can get her old job back. It'll fix everything! [sighs]
905000 [knocking]
905000 [door opens]
9054dd Didn't you see the sign? No salesponies!
905003 Oh, I'm not selling anything.
9054dd No carolers either. No surveys, no petitions, no free literature...
905000 [thud]
905003 No problem. I'm just looking for somepony who used to live here. I'm pretty sure this was her house.
9054dd Dusty Pages?
905003 Yes!
9054dd Hold on. She moved to... Silver somethin'. Shoals, Seas, Surfer, whatever. When you find her, give her this.
905000 [thud]
9054dd It's been stackin' up for years! And tell her to change her address!
905000 [door slams]
905000 [montage music]
905000 [knocking]
905000 [squeaking]
905003 [reading] Silver Stable Community - For the best golden years." This has to be it!
905005 I hope so. It's the last "Silver" spot on the map we haven't looked.
905000 [door opens]
905005 [straining] [gasps] Whoa! This place is—
905003 Terrible, I know! There's not a single bookshelf in sight!
90515e [snoring]
905003 Poor Dusty... [to receptionist] Excuse me!
905259 Yes, how may I help you?
905003 Do you have a resident named Dusty Pages?
905259 Oh, yes. Her apartment is in the next complex, ground floor.
905003 Thank you!
905003 I can't believe that my carelessness sent her here, when she could be happily surrounded by millions of wonderful-smelling books!
905005 You realize that might just be a you thing, right?
905003 [gasps] There she is! Here we go. [exhales]
905000 [knocking]
905000 [long pause]
905000 [watch ticking]
905003 [groans]
905005 She's bound to be back soon. Maybe we should just wait here.
905003 No. We are fixing this now. This place isn't that big. We can find her.
905003 Sorry to interrupt your plein air painting, but we're looking for Dusty Pages. Have you seen her?
9051e6 Sure have!
905000 [beat]
905003 [sighs] And...?
9051e6 She had to leave early to get to her fengbi de ti session.
9054de Which is right before she leads the woodworking class with me. Then she's on to windsurfing.
9051e6 Ooh, and don't forget theatre rehearsal! Dusty's playing the lead role. Again.
9054de Then there's her band practice later.
905003 Thank you!
905005 Wow. Dusty sounds like one busy pony.
905003 Oh, she's just filling her days with distractions to cover the pain of losing the best job ever! But not for long!
905000 [montage music]
905000 [gate swinging]
905000 [teleportation zap]
905000 [hammer tapping]
905000 [door shuts and opens]
905000 [splash]
905000 [more splashes]
905000 [door opens]
905000 [door opens]
905000 [band playing music]
905003 Dusty Pages, finally! Come on, Spike!
905005 Wait. She looks pretty happy up there.
905003 Trust me, it's all an act. She'll be a lot happier when I deliver the news that she can go back to working at the library!
905000 [music abruptly stops]
905003 Care to take five, everypony?
9054da Ah! Twilight Sparkle?! My stars! It's so wonderful to see you! What are you doing here?
905003 I've been looking all over Equestria for you!
905000 [thud]
905003 I need to tell you something.
9054da Well, you brought my mail! Oh, thank you! [chuckles]
905003 No. I mean, yes, we did, but that's not why we're here. I let you down, and I can't forgive myself until I set things right.
9054da I don't remember you doing anything wrong.
905003 You told me to take care of a special book I checked out from the Canterlot Library, and I never brought it back!
9054da [gasps] It was you that had that book out? The one that broke my perfect record?
905003 But now you can bring it to Canterlot Library and get your job back!
9054da No, thank you! I don't ever need to see that library again! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere to be.
905000 [band playing music]
905005 [snapping fingers]
905003 Do you mind?
905000 [music pauses, continues softly]
905005 [slurping]
905003 I don't understand. If Dusty Pages won't go back to Canterlot Library and explain everything, then she won't be able to get her job back. Even worse, her record will remain imperfect!
905005 And yours will, too?
905003 Well, yeah! But that doesn't matter any more!
905005 [dryly] Really?
905003 Well, maybe a little bit. Oh, no, bits! The late fines! How much do I owe now?!
905000 [abacus clicking]
905005 Uhhh... you don't wanna know.
905003 [groans] It would've been worth all the bits in Equestria if I had made things right with Dusty! I wish I knew why she won't go back!
905005 Why don't you ask her?
905003 She didn't seem to want to talk.
905005 You surprised her, and she probably had something else on her schedule. That thing is packed! Come on. What have you got to lose?
905003 Now that I've messed up this much? Nothing. You're right, Spike. It's worth a try. Where do you think she went? Crochet? Bingo?
905000 [splat]
905003 A squishy fruit food-fight tournament?!
905000 [splats]
905005 Hey, everypony! We come in—
905000 [splat]
905005 Eh, pieces.
905000 [splats]
905000 [teleportation zap]
905000 [splats]
905003 Stop! We just want to talk to Dusty Pages for a moment! Please?
9054da Time out! [to Twilight] Next time, you should rent gear.
905005 We're not actually here for the game.
905003 I was hoping you'd give me another chance to talk to you about the library book.
9054da [sighs] This really means a lot to you, doesn't it?
905003 Mm-hmm. I know I ruined your life by not returning my book on time, and I will do anything I can to make it up to you. Even promise to never take a book out of a library again, if that's what it takes.
905000 [ponies gasp]
9054da [laughs]
905005 That is not the reaction we expected.
9054da Twilight, dear, you've got it all backwards! I'm not upset with you!
905003 You're not?
9054da No! If I'm mad at anypony, it's me.
905000 [tapping]
9054da All those years I spent hiding away in that library, trying to be perfect. When your book never came in, I felt something exhilarating!
905003 What was it?
9054da Freedom.
905005 From books?
9054da From perfection! I was too stubborn to know when to call it quits! It took your mistake to make me realize that I wasn't living the life I wanted!
905003 You mean you weren't fired? You left the library because you wanted to?
9054da Twilight, your late book was the best thing that ever happened to me. Now I'm not afraid to try things I might fail at. In fact, sometimes messing up teaches me more than getting it right!
905003 You're sure you don't want to return it and get that perfect record back?
905000 [splat]
905003 [strangled scream]
9054da Ah, good. It was a yellow one. You can still see the words.
905003 But it'll have a stain!
9054da That doesn't change the truth inside it. Wait. Did you even read that thing?
905003 Actually, uh, no, I guess I didn't.
905000 [splat]
905003 [reading] "Perfection".
9054da And the next part?
905003 [reading] "The Impossible Pursuit".
9054df [laughing]
905003 Oh. That might've been useful to look at earlier.
9054dc Uh-huh... Your total late fees come to...
905003 However much it is, I'll cover it. Uh, do you have a monthly payment plan?
9054dc Twenty-eight bits.
905049 [gasps]
905005 That's it?!
9054dc Yah-huh. Most ponies don't know that it caps at a month. Probably 'cause we don't tell them. [snorts]
905000 [bits clinking]
9054dc Thank you. Your account is back to normal. Although we will be taking down your Best Book Borrower picture.
905003 Um, is that really necessary? Heh. It just seems so permanent. Heh. I mean, I did return the book, after all.
905005 [clears throat]
905003 Okay. Letting the perfection go. [sighs] You want me to reshelve this for you?
9054dc No, it's an old edition. We've already replaced it with a new copy.
905005 In that case, can we keep it? It might be a good reminder to have around.
9054dc You sure? It's got a stain.
905003 That's what makes it perfect.

906124 Highlights in the world of sports! Buckball fever has swept Equestria! What started as a backyard hobby for fruit farmers and the like has blossomed into a literal phenomenon, with something for everypony. Unicorns, Pegasi, and Earth ponies alike can't get enough of this breakthrough sport.
906000 [fans cheering]
906124 And with its popularity still on the rise, buckball fans want—nay, demand—an institution catering to their new obsession. And the ponies of Appleloosa answered the call, delivering a state-of-the-art locale where fans Equestria over can celebrate their passion - the Buckball Hall of Fame. Though given the game's recent nature, the only inductees so far will be the members of the current championship team from Ponyville.
906007 [whispering loudly] Do you think they know we're here?
90600c I think they have a pretty good idea.
906035 A pretty good idea about what? [chomps]
906000 [theme song]
90600e I can't believe the ponies of Appleloosa built this place.
906007 Yeah, especially after their team lost to us. They must really love buckball.
906432 [chuckles] Oh, my gosh! It's you! I can't believe you're you! I mean, here! I mean, Team Ponyville! Yeah!
906035 Yep, it's us.
906432 How much for an autograph?
906036 Bits for autographs, eh?
906000 [cha-ching!]
906036 [whispering] Snails, you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
906035 What is the sound of one hoof clapping?
906036 Yeah! I mean, uh, no! How many of you would pay for an autograph from my best friend Snails?
906000 [ponies clamoring]
9064e0 I can't believe I'm about to get his autograph.
906035 Wow! That's a lot of writing.
90600e I'm so proud they decided to honor us. I never thought I'd get to be in anything like a Hall of Fame.
906007 Me, neither! Unless you count a Royal Order of Party Planners Memorial Library, which I don't, because every party planner gets one of those eventually.
906000 [hooves clack]
906000 [clamoring continues]
906000 [bits jingling]
90600e I hope Snails finishes signing autographs soon. We can't play without him. And if we lose or forfeit one game, we'll be out of the tournament.
90600c Well, he better get his flank over here then! You have to win the first few games without me cheering you on.
90600e Oh, why?
90600c [sighs] Applejack was too busy to come, so she made me promise to go to all the museum exhibits and tell her about them. I'm gonna try to get in first and beat the crowd so I can get back to the tournament faster.
906007 Ooh! Then you'd better hurry. Looks like there's already a line.
90600c What?! [grunts] The doors aren't even open yet! What kind of sports fan camps out for a museum?
906355 The real question is what kind of sports fan doesn't?
90600c [gasps] Quibble Pants?
906355 Rainbow Dash, fancy meeting you here.
90600c Fancy meeting me? I'm a sportspony. Of course I'd be here. What's fancy is you being here. If "fancy" meant confusing.
906355 There's nothing fancy or confusing about it. Y-You can't keep me away from that... that buckball rink. I'm... I'm the biggest fan there is.
90600c Uh, it's a buckball field. And you are?
906355 Oh... sure. What w-with all th-the bucking and the balling, uh, uh, on the buckball field, w-which is where they play buckball. I-I-I wanted to be first inside to experience the grand history of the sport. I-I mean, I guess only a real fan would understand that.
90600c Whaaaa...?
906355 Oh, perfect timing. Rainbow Dash, I'd like you to meet Clear Sky, the most amazing pony I've ever met.
90600c Um, you've met Daring Do, so that's probably an exaggeration. [to Clear Sky] No offense.
9064e1 None taken. When it comes to describing your special somepony, a little exaggeration's normal. [to Quibble] And I feel the same way about you.
90600c And who is this?
9064e1 This is my daughter Wind Sprint.
906355 And she is pretty amazing, too!
9064e1 Wind, did you thank Quibble for camping out so we'd be first in line?
9064e2 [unenthusiastic] Thanks.
906355 No problem. I-I-I probably would have done it anyway. I mean, I... I can't wait to see the... [reading from a brochure] "evolution of the buck basket from farm to field"! That... That sounds just, I mean, oh, wow! There... There is a lot to see!
906000 [crowd cheering]
9064e2 I'd rather see the game.
906355 Oh. Well, I... I mean, sure. T-T-That makes sense. We could just go to the tournament instead.
9064e1 No! Quibble planned this whole thing for us, and you could be a little more appreciative!
906000 [door opens]
90600c [chuckles] I kind of wanted to skip the museum, too. But I promised a friend that I'd check out all the exhibits.
9064e2 Ugh! All of them?
906355 You, know, I-I'd like a chance to catch up with Rainbow Dash. Why don't we split up? We'll... We'll cover more ground that way, and...
90600c So... you and Clear Sky, huh?
906355 Oh, yeah, she's great. Honestly, I've never been happier... [panicked] Which is why I need your help! I don't know what any of this stuff is!
90600c What do you mean?
906355 See this? I-I don't know what it is.
90600c A ball?
906355 W— And this? I-I— No idea!
90600c It's a basket. How do you not know what these are?
906355 I'm not even a hundred percent sure what bucking is. I literally know nothing about buckball or any other sport!
90600c Well, I figured you weren't the sportiest pony in Equestria.
906355 But Wind Sprint is, and her dad was some big athlete, too. I-I can't compete with that. I really want things with Clear Sky to work out, but if Wind doesn't like me, I-I might as well give up.
90600c Uh, why?
906355 They're a family. Even if it's okay with Clear Sky, I wouldn't ask them to make me a part of it if Wind Sprint isn't on board. I thought if I could convince Wind I was a big buckball fan, we'd have something to bond over, but I'm... I'm pretty sure she's on to me.
90600c Here.
906355 [grunting]
90600c Give it a shot. It's easy.
906355 Aah! Aah! Oof!
906000 [thud]
90600c Yeah, I don't think she's fooled.
906355 Could... Could you talk to her? I-I mean, you're a famous sportspony. Y-You'd know what to say. Maybe you could talk me up a little.
90600c Ha! No problem. I've totally got your flank.
906355 [grunts]
90600c [to Wind Sprint] Trust me, the game's a lot harder to play with apples.
9064e2 You play?
90600c Who do you think taught them? Of course, being a Wonderbolt takes up most of my time, so I don't get to practice as much as I'd like.
9064e2 Wait. You're Rainbow Dash? The Wonderbolt? Whoa, my dad was a great flyer, too.
90600c Hmm, you don't say. You know, Quibble's pretty sporty, too.
9064e1 [groans]
906355 [grunts]
906000 [thud]
9064e2 [unconvinced] If you say so.
90600c I think I've seen enough of this museum for three Applejacks. Let's go watch some buckball!
906355 That sounds awesome! Oh, but first, I got you [singsongy] a little surprise.
9064e2 [unimpressed] Oh. A book.
906000 [thud]
906355 Oh, not just a book. It's a buckball almanac. This thing has every buckball fact and statistic ever recorded!
9064e2 [sarcastic] Wow.
906355 I know! I never realized there was so much math in buckball. I-I mean, this game's got more numbers than Ogres & Oubliettes. [laughs, snorts]
9064e2 Thanks?
906355 I-I-I guess I could hold it for you. You know, so you don't have to carry it.
9064e2 Can we go to the game now?
9064e1 Sure, honey. Listen, Q, this trip was a lovely idea, and the book was sweet, but you don't have to try so hard. Everything's gonna be fine. [kisses]
906355 Not even my presents are in the ball court.
90600c Uh, do you mean "ball park"?
906355 Do I?! I don't know! One thing's for sure - Wind is never gonna like a pony like me.
90600c Of course she will. She just needs to see your sporty side.
906355 I don't have a sporty side.
90600c Everypony has a sporty side, and we're gonna find yours. By the end of the day, I am gonna turn you into the sportiest pony in Equestria!
906355 Look, I'm not saying it's a terrible idea, but it's a terrible idea! You can't turn me into an athlete! It's impossible!
90600c It's either that or be yourself and bond with Wind over comic books and role-playing games.
9064e2 Ooh! Ah! [laughs]
906355 Uh, I have a 17 charisma, all right? Don't you think I tried? She doesn't even like Daring Do. She thinks she's not athletic enough.
90600c What?! Wow. We need to get started on "Operation Sportify" ASAP.
90600c To figure out what your sporty side is, we just need to see what your skills are. Everypony's got something. Speed!
906000 [zooming]
90600c Strength!
906355 Whoa!
90600c Agility! Heh. Of course, some ponies can do it all.
906355 You're amazing, but what about me?
90600c Right. We should probably start small. I'll pass the ball to you, and you just pass it back to me, okay?
906355 Okay. Uh-huh.
906000 [music builds up]
906355 And... buckball!
906000 [thud]
906355 Ow.
90600c Okay. Maybe agility's not your thing.
90600c Ready?
906355 If I say no, do I still have to run?
90600c Yep.
906036 Can we get on with this? Snails and I did so well with the autographs, we decided to expand. And these souvenirs are not going to sell themselves!
90600c Remember, think speed.
906355 Got it.
90600c On your marks, get set...
906355 Speed. Speed.
90600c Go! [blows whistle]
906355 Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Speed! Whew! [laughs] Okay! What a race, right? Oh. So much for speed.
906036 Eh, this was fun, but I've gotta get back to work.
90600c Come on, Quibble. You got this!
906355 [strained voice] I... got... this! I... Ugh! This is hopeless. I... I don't have any skills. Not agility, not speed. I-I can't even lift more than one book, and I love books!
90600c If we had time to train, I know I could mold you into the perfect sportspony. [groans] Or at least a sportier pony.
906355 Who knows how long that would take? I-I need to get Wind to like me now.
906000 [crowd cheering]
90600c Maybe you're not the best athlete in Equestria, or the most coordinated, or the fastest, or... even a little bit strong.
906355 I-I'm sorry, wait. Is this supposed to be making me feel better? Because it's not.
90600c But none of that matters because I just figured out how to sportify you!
906000 [action theme]
906000 [whistle blows]
906000 [crowd cheering]
9064e3 And with that score, the stars of Team Ponyville advance to the next round. If they keep winning like this, they'll never get off the field.
9064e2 Wow! The players from Ponyville are so good!
906355 They sure are.
9064e1 Quibble, where have you been? I was hoping we'd all watch the tournament together.
906355 Oh, I've just been arranging for us to hang out with a few of my close friends. From Team Ponyville. That is, if Wind's up for it.
9064e1 This is wonderful, Q, but I still feel like you're trying too hard to get Wind's approval.
9064e2 This is so great! Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy are the best players out there!
90600c Well, you can thank Quibble. Wonderbolts, buckball stars... He's friends with the sportiest ponies around, so he must be pretty sporty, too, right?
906007 Ooh, so this is Quibble Pants. Rainbow Dash told us all about how you two spent a whole Daring Do convention geeking out together about books!
90600e And even though at first she thought you were the most annoying fanpony she ever met, you two eventually became friends.
906355 Uh...
9064e1 I guess even sportsponies agree. Quibble's a pony you like more and more over time.
9064e2 Ugh. Knowing sportsponies isn't the same as being one. [to Fluttershy and Pinkie] What's it like playing in front of all those fans?
90600e Um...
90600c I guess you'll find out.
9064e2 What do you mean?
906355 Yes, what do you mean?
90600c I think it's time we told Wind about your next surprise.
9064e1 Q, Wind really doesn't need any more surprises.
9064e2 Is it another book?
90600c A – books are awesome. And B – this is way more awesomer than that! For the tournament halftime show, you and Quibble are gonna play a game of buckball against Team Ponyville!
906355 We're what?!
906000 [distant crowd cheering]
906000 [whoosh, thud]
906000 [whirring, thuds]
90600c Uh, you should probably stretch.
906355 No amount of stretching is gonna make this okay! What were you thinking?!
90600c Look, you wanted to impress Wind Sprint, and this just made sense.
906355 Really? How does me making a fool of myself in front of her, Sky, and a billion buckball fans make sense?
90600c Don't worry, I've got your flank. I already talked to Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy. They're totally gonna make you look good.
906355 Oh. Okay, well, maybe this isn't the absolute worst idea ever.
9064e3 Mares and stallions, foals and colts! Put your hooves together for today's halftime presentation, as buckball's biggest stars take on a team of fans just like you!
906000 [crowd cheering]
9064e4 [blows whistle]
906000 [whoosh]
906000 [thud]
906000 [crowd cheers]
9064e3 And that's one for the Ponyville champs! Looks like these fans don't know what they signed up for!
9064e4 [blows whistle]
906000 [whooshing]
90600e [flatly] Oh, no. Quibble's wide open, and I'll never get there in time to block.
906000 [whoosh]
906000 [slow motion noise]
906000 [crowd awwws]
9064e3 Ooh! Looks like our fan team needs to work on their passing!
9064e4 [blows whistle]
906000 [whooshing]
90600e [gasps]
906007 Hee-hee!
906000 [crack]
906000 [smack]
906000 [thud]
90600e [gasps]
906007 [gasps]
9064e3 And the fan team finally scores! ...For the other side. That makes three! Team Ponyville wins!
906000 [smack]
906000 [thud]
906355 It says very clearly on page six-forty-seven of the expanded buckball tournament rules that "a goal is scored when an Earth pony sends the ball into a basket". But it doesn't say which basket!
90600c Yeah, I'm pretty sure everypony knows you're not supposed to score in the other team's goal.
906355 But the rules don't say that! If that goal is ours, it's only two-to-one, and we can keep playing.
9064e2 I don't want to! You're not a sportspony! It's not fun playing this game with you!
906355 I was just... trying to get her to like me.
9064e1 I know! But I told you you didn't need to. You and I have to rethink all of this.
906355 [whimpers, sighs]
90600c What are you doing out here?
906355 Apparently this book is as close to sports as I'll ever get.
90600c Come on. That goal you scored for the other team was amazing.
906355 [sighs] Thanks for trying, Rainbow Dash, but I think we can both agree the whole sportify idea was a big flop.
906000 [thump]
90600c What?! We haven't even gotten started! I've got, like, seven more top-notch ideas to turn you into a super-sporty pony!
906355 [sighs] Wind's already made up her mind, and so have I. Time to throw up the towel.
90600c It's "throw in the towel". And that's ridiculous! You can't just give up!
906355 Wind and Sky deserve a pony they both like in their lives. Besides, Sky wants to "rethink things", so I'm just beating her to the lunch.
90600c It's "beating her to the punch", and it's barely a sports reference. How do you not know that?
906355 Because... I! Don't! Know! Anything! About! Sports! And pretending I did just made things worse.
90600c So you should stop pretending! Look, you are terrible at sports. You're uncoordinated, slow, weak—
906355 Okay, again, not really making me feel better.
90600c And you're completely clueless about anything having to do with athletics. But maybe I'm not the pony you should've come to for help.
906355 Oh.
9064e2 I wish we didn't even come here.
9064e1 Quibble thought you'd like it.
9064e2 Well, I don't, and I don't like him. Why do you like him?
9064e1 Because he's kind, and smart, and his friends certainly seem to care about him, which is always a good sign.
9064e2 I don't care how many ponies care about him. They're not gonna make me forget about Dad.
9064e1 Oh, sweetheart. I know Quibble's trying too hard, but he doesn't want you to stop loving your dad. He just wants you to like him. And I think maybe there's enough room in your heart to do both.
906355 Hey, there. Glad I found you, because I have a confession to make. I know it's hard to imagine, but I'm... really not all that sporty.
9064e1 [mock horror] [gasps] No!
906355 I'm sorry I was trying so hard to convince you otherwise. I just really wanted us to get along, but I guess it backfired. Do you think we could start over? Maybe we could watch some of the tournament together, and you could teach me some sports stuff?
906000 [whoosh, thud]
906000 [crowd cheering]
9064e2 Okay. That's their ball.
906355 I'll try to remember that if I ever decide to play buckball again. But I probably won't. Oh, look. Pinkie Pie's gonna flip and triple bounce the ball into the goal.
906000 [springing]
906000 [thud]
906000 [crowd cheers]
9064e2 How did you know that?
906355 It's right here. Pinkie flips and triple-bounce bucks over eighty percent of her shots from the northwest section of the field when the wind is blowing from the east.
9064e2 Huh. I guess this book's kind of cool after all.
9064e1 [slurping]
906355 Look, Sky, I know you're thinking of calling it quits between us, and after today, I don't blame you. But Wind and I just made a connection!
9064e1 Calling it quits? What are you talking about?
906355 You said you wanted to rethink things.
9064e1 Yeah! Things like having your friend help you pretend to be a sportspony so Wind would like you.
906355 Wha— I-I don't— I— Oh! I-I didn't... What?!
90600c Say wha—? [nervous laugh] Wha...?! Hah! Nah!
9064e2 Mom, look what Quibble showed me! [reading] "When Fluttershy flies higher than the other Pegasus, Pinkie scores ninety-two percent of the time," and it just happened!
9064e1 Wow! You better watch out, or you're gonna start to like books.
9064e2 I guess that wouldn't be so bad.
9064e1 Huh. Looks like you didn't need sportiness, famous ponies, or lavish gifts to bond with Wind after all.
90600c Technically, he still needed to buy her the book, but that's it.
9064e5 [laughing]
906000 [credits]
907185 [gasps] See?! New posters! We never had those underwater!
907183 [excited chattering]
907003 I won't keep you in suspense any longer. We're bringing one of Ponyville's oldest traditions to our school – the Fetlock Fete.
907186 The what-lock what?
907188 It's a pony dance party! They're the best!
907189 I'm ready!
907000 [transformation noise]
907003 [giggles] You don't need to do that, Ocellus. This year, the event's at school and open to everycreature. We're calling our dance the Amity Ball.
907189 Even better!
907000 [transformation noise]
907187 Yona not know Amity Ball dance. Yona only know traditional dance of Yakyakistan. Go like this! [grunting]
907000 [loud thumping]
907187 Ball dance like that?
907000 [thud]
907188 [laughs] Not exactly. It isn't just one dance. It's a whole night of them. Plus an awesome party!
907003 And we'll have all the old Fetlock Fete traditions – the Pony Pal Contest, the lucky pot dinner. You'll love it! So, like this says, "get your pony pal and come along."
907186 Want to go? I've got nothing better to do.
907184 You had me at "dinner".
907185 [giggles]
907003 Now, who wants to help me hang more posters?
907185 Me!
907189 Sure!
907188 Hey, Yona, want to be my pony pal? We can enter the contest together.
907187 But Yona yak. Yona not pony.
907188 So?
907187 Pony, pony, more pony.
907188 Aw, that's just a poster. Come on! It'll be tons of fun together. Promise.
907187 Okay. Yona go with Sandbar.
907188 Great! I'll get the tickets. See you later! [laughs]
907187 Yona not let Sandbar down! Yak best at being pony pal! But Yona not sure how if she not pony.
907000 [crash]
90700d Ooh! Oh, terribly sorry, Yona. All these dresses I'm sewing for the dance have me completely frazzled.
907187 Dress? Yona need dress for dance?! Yona have lots to learn about being best pony pal.
907000 [theme song]
907000 [sewing machine whirring]
907000 [knocking]
90700d [yelps]
907000 [door opens]
907187 Yona interrupting?
90700d Oh. [laughs] Well, not interrupting exactly. More like blocking the flow— uh, stopping me from what I'm doing— so, yes, interrupting! [nervous laugh] Now, what can I do for you, Yona?
907187 Yona not know yak need special pony dress for dance. Yona no can wear what Yona always wear?
90700d Yona could— I mean, you could. But the Fetlock Fete or whatever Twilight is calling it – it's all about a tradition. There's a certain way to do everything at the dance.
907187 Yes! That what Yona want to learn! How to do all the pony things, even if Yona has to wear dress.
90700d Well, uh, y-y-yes, if that's what you really want.
907187 Mm-hmm! Yona be best pony pal for Sandbar!
90700d In that case, at an elegant affair like a pony dance, one must converse in a sophisticated fashion. Talking with Brussels sprouts in your mouth helps you to learn to [elocuting] ar-ti-cu-late. [normally] Take a mouthful, and repeat after me.
907187 [chomps]
90700d [elocuting] How kind of you to ask me to tea.
907187 [muffled] How kind of you to ask me to tea.
90700d [elocuting] May I offer you a glass of punch?
907187 [muffled] May I offer you a glass of punch?
90700d [elocuting] The weather is quite agreeable today.
907187 [muffled] The weather is quite agreeable today. [chews, gulps, belches loudly] Yona like Brussels sprouts!
90700d Let's move on.
90700d We will need to do something about your hairstyle. But first, let's find the right dress!
907000 [wheels squeaking]
90700d Now, purple taffeta, frosted chiffon... [gasps] Gold brocade! One of my favorites!
907187 Yona like brown.
90700d Blech... Earth tones. They're so... [laughs nervously] ...earthy, aren't they? Don't worry. We shall find something to make you stand out.
907187 Yona not want to stand out. Yona want to fit in.
90700d [sighs] Quite. And by the time we're through, it'll be like you've been going to pony dances your whole life.
90700d [Rarity]
90700d The more you know how things are done
90700d The more confident you'll be
90700d There's more to a dance than just having fun
90700d And there's no better teacher than me
90700d Rarity!
907187 Oh, Yona see!
90700d When I'm finished with you
90700d You'll start to fit right in
90700d Listen to me when I say
90700d Once you learn the pony way
90700d You'll start to fit right in
907187 [Yona]

90700d No need to wait another day
90700d To be part of our smart soiree
90700d The perfect dress
90700d A color all the rage, but still unique
90700d Now loose the braids
90700d Try a style more fantastique
90700d Here's what we'll do -
90700d A horn-icure and a de-frizz
90700d We'll dry shampoo this
90700d Whatever yak part this is
90700d Too curly, too blue
90700d Too retro, too new
90700d Too Twilight, too furry
90700d We'll find one, don't you worry

90700d Yeah, you're gonna—
907187 [Yona]
907187 Yona gonna—
907000 [Rarity and Yona]
907000 Fit right in
907187 [Yona]
907187 Right in
90700d [Rarity]
90700d Listen to me when I say
90700d Once you learn the pony way
907000 [Rarity and Yona]
907000 You'll/I'll start to fit right in
90700d [Rarity]
90700d Right in
907187 [Yona]
907187 Yak not waste another day
907187 To be part of your pony...
907000 [Rarity and Yona]
907000 Waaaaayyyyy
907187 [Yona]
907187 Yak not waste another day to
907000 [Rarity and Yona]
907000 Fit... right... in!
907000 [thud]
90700d [gasps] I almost forgot! The most important part of the ball!
907187 Oh. [scoffs, laughs] Yona already have pony pal.
90700d Oh, not that, darling. The dancing! And I know precisely who can help!
907187 Uh... Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy good at dancing?
90700c Don't be so surprised. I'm awesome at everything! Except for baking.
90700e There are two traditional dances that everypony does at the Fete. After a few days of practicing with us, you'll know them both.
907187 And fit right in!
90700d Absolutely. We'll start with the slow dance, the Pony Cotillion. That's Fluttershy's specialty.
90700e Oh, [nervous laugh], I wouldn't say specialty. It's just fun. Here, Yona. I made you a chart.
907000 [paper unfurling]
90700e All you have to do is follow these dance steps. You'll learn them in no time.
907000 [thump]
907000 [record needle scratches]
907000 [classical music plays]
90700e Now, just start walking. Step on whatever color I name. Let's begin. Blue, red, step ahead. Green, black, now step back. Now you try.
907187 Blue, red, step— ah, oh! No. Um, Yona start over. Blue, red, green, black, yak step back?
90700e Good! Now, black, green, red, and blue. Red, black, hold one and two. Red, blue, red once more. Green, black, blue, red, three and four.
907187 [yelps] Yona feel like she has four front feet! [yelps]
907000 [thud]
907000 [squeaking]
90700d [sighs]
90700e Ooh. Um, maybe we should try this again later.
90700c Don't worry, Yona.
907000 [whoosh]
90700c That was the hard one. Mine's way easier.
907000 [needle scratches]
907000 [uptempo pop music plays]
90700c A little dance called the Pony Prance! The key to this one is speed!
907000 [whooshing]
90700c Come on, Yona, try it! Just get with the flow and let yourself go!
907000 [loud thumping]
907000 [crashing]
90700d Oh, my!
90700c Whoa there!
907187 [panting] Yona like to flow and go!
907000 [thump]
907008 Welcome to Sweet Apple Acres, Yona. Rarity tells us you need some help gettin' ready for the big dance.
90700d "Some". Ha! Indeed. And we only have a few more days.
907007 Well, you've come to the right place. Because if you asked me what my favorite part of the dance is, I'd say everything about the dance! But especially... this! The Fetlock lucky pot dinner!
907008 It's part of the Ponyville dance tradition. Everypony brings a dish to share, and we swap 'em without knowin' whose is whose. Although my lucky pot probably gives me away. [laughs]
907007 You can cook anything you want! Like, can I suggest, oh, I don't know, maybe... cupcakes?!
90700d Uh, I already told Yona a little bit about that tradition. She's even brought her own lucky... bucket.
907187 Yak buckets are best buckets. Yona think make traditional yak dish – tree-root stew!
907000 [flies buzzing]
907187 Extra fiber. Mmmm. Ponies like?
907007 Hmm, I'm not sure. So, just in case, let's get baking!
907007 [quickly] Flour, milk, sugar, butter, icing. Then we mix, and we beat, and we pour into pans. We bake...
907000 [ding!]
907007 And now you try it!
907000 [ripping]
907187 [sneezes]
907007 Well, that's one way to mix it.
907008 Let's try somethin' a little simpler. I'm sure we can do somethin' with these.
907187 Yah!
907000 [splat]
907008 O-kay. Applesauce it is.
907000 [thwack]
907000 [montage music]
907187 Blue, red, green... whoa! Blue...
907000 [tumbling]
907000 [splatting]
907000 [ripping]
907000 [whiffle-whiffle-whiffle]
907000 [ding!]
907187 [muffled] How kind of you to ask me to tea.
907000 [scrubbing]
907000 [boinging]
907187 [chomp] [less muffled] How kind of you to ask me to tea.
907025 [snoring]
907187 [rhythmically] Blue, red, step ahead. [elocuting] How kind of you... [rhythmically] Green, black, Yona step back. [elocuting] ...to ask Yona to tea. [rhythmically] Black, green, red, and blue. Red, black hold one and two. Red, blue, red once more. Green, black, blue, red, three and four!
90700c Look! She's dancing!
907008 How 'bout that? And she's good!
90700d Yona, if someone at the party tells you they're thirsty, you say...
907187 [elocuting] May Yona— um... May I offer you a cup of punch?
90700d By Celestia, I think she's got it!
907007 She's really got it!
907008 Yona, you did it!
90700c You dance great!
90700e And are so well spoken!
907007 You'll be the hit of the ball!
90700d [Rarity]
90700d You've mastered so many pony ways
90700d And grown a lot in the past few days
90700d You've shown a turn that has earned our praise
907187 [Yona]
907187 And now I fit right...
907000 [Rarity and Yona]
907000 ...in
907000 [Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie]
907000 You fit right in!
907005 [amplified] Hello, everycreature! I'm your DJ, Scales-n-Tail, spinning your favorite tunes all night long! So welcome to the Fetlock Fet— I mean, the Amity Ball!
907000 [students cheering]
907184 I'm just glad I'm here with you guys. Least I'm not the only non-pony in the crowd.
907188 You're not still worried about that, are you? Like Headmare Twilight said, this is a dance for everycreature. There's no pony pressure.
9074e6 [giggling]
907189 You should've told Yona that.
907188 Uh, what do you mean?
907185 Didn't you hear? Our teachers have been helping her get ready for the dance! She's been taking lessons. [crunching]
907186 She's gone full pony for the dance.
907184 All for you.
907000 [snap!]
907188 For me? Why?
907187 [elocuting] How kind of you to ask me to this soiree, Sandbar.
9074e7 Uhh...
907186 What?
907185 You look so weird!
907188 Yona?!
907187 [elocuting] Quite. Oh, I do hope I make a good pony pal for you.
907188 Uh, of course you do. But, Yona, you didn't need to do any of... this.
907186 And why are you talking so funny?
907187 [elocuting] I am not "talking funny". I'm fitting in.
907184 Could've fooled me.
90700d Yona! You look absolutely scrumptious, darling. [kissing] Uh, why don't I get that for you?
907188 You made a lucky pot?
907187 [elocuting] Precisely like ponies prepare!
907000 [microphone feedback]
907003 [amplified] Welcome, everycreature, to our school's first annual Amity Ball! For those of you who've never attended a Fetlock Fete, we can't wait to show you some of our fun traditions on this special night!
907000 [students cheering]
907003 [amplified] So, Spike...
907005 Uh, Scales-n-Tail?
907003 [amplified] Uh, right. Scales-n-Tail. [to crowd] Let's get this party started!
907005 [amplified] Oh, yeah, party ponies! It's time to raise the roof and stomp your hoof for the traditional first dance of the night, the Pony Cotillion!
907000 [classical music plays]
907187 Ah! Yona know this one!
907188 You do?
907187 [elocuting] Indeed! Green, black, then step back. Shall we?
907000 [spoon clinks]
90700c [gasps]
907007 [giggles]
907008 [chuckles]
907188 [chuckles] Wow! How did you learn this?
907187 [elocuting] I had good teachers.
907000 [stretching]
907187 Whoa!
907000 [crash]
907000 [students gasp]
907000 [music stops]
907188 [gasps] Yona! Are you alright?
907187 Yona never practice dance with dress on. Uh... [elocuting] I mean, [chuckles] may I offer you a cup of punch?
907000 [pouring]
907005 [amplified] Time to shake things up a little! That's right, everycreature! It's the Pony Prance!
907000 [slider clicking]
907000 [uptempo pop music plays]
907188 Uh, maybe we should sit this one out.
907187 [elocuting] No! I do so love the Pony Prance!
907188 Ah!
907000 [hooves clicking]
907187 [yelps]
907000 [crunching and crashing]
907000 [record needle scratches]
907000 [worried chattering]
90700d [screams]
907187 [yelps]
907188 It's okay, Yona!
907186 Just stop bouncing!
907184 We got you!
907000 [smack!]
907188 [grunts]
907000 [smack!]
907185 [grunts]
907000 [smack!]
907186 [grunts]
907000 [smack!]
907184 Ah!
907187 Wig... come... off! [grunts] Huh? [yelps]
907000 [skidding brakes]
907000 [crash!]
907000 [splat]
907000 [clang]
907000 [splats]
907188 [gasps]
907000 [splats]
90700d What a calamitous yak-ccident!
907188 Yona!
907189 What happened?!
907185 Are you all right?
907187 [bawling] No! Yona not all right! Yona want to be alone! [crying]
907000 [flump]
907187 Yona:
907187 Yona sad...
907187 Yona sing sad song...
907187 Sad Yona...
907000 [bird twittering]
907187 Yona no blame bird. Yona no want to be around Yona either.
907187 Yona sad...
907187 Yona sing sad song...
907188 Yona?
907187 [panicked gasp] [sniffling] How Sandbar find Yona?
907188 I know you pretty well by now. I figured you'd come here. Besides, it's where I'd go if something like that happened to me.
907187 Sandbar mean something awful and embarrassing. So awful, Yona cannot come down from treehouse ever!
907000 [whirring]
907187 Will Sandbar bring Yona food and water?
907188 You know, it really wasn't that bad. I don't think anycreature hardly even noticed.
907000 [beat]
907188 Well, maybe one or two didn't. If they happened to be in Canterlot for the day. But anyway, it's all over now, so... will you come back to the dance with me?
907000 [thump]
907187 Yona disappoint Sandbar. Yona not make very good pony.
907188 Why would you think you disappointed me? And who said anything about having to be a good pony?
907187 Yona just want to do all the right pony things and fit in at dance! Then maybe Sandbar and Yona win best pony pals contest. Instead, Yona win worst pony ever.
907000 [crunch]
907188 That's not true.
907187 Really? Sandbar, name two ponies worse than Yona.
907188 Cozy Glow and Sombra.
907187 [chuckles] Okay, Sandbar right. They worse.
907188 Yona, it doesn't really matter if you're a great pony or a horrible pony. You're the best Yona I know. That's why I asked you to the dance.
907187 Really?
907188 I never wanted you to be anything other than what you are. My friend, Yona, the yak. [grunts] So, what do you say? Let's go back to the dance?
907000 [sweeping]
90700d [sighs]
907000 [door opens]
90700d [gasps]
90700e [gasps]
907188 [hushed] Don't worry. I'm with you.
907184 We all are.
907007 Yona! Are you all right?
90700e We were so worried when you disappeared like that.
907187 Yona fine, but... Yona sorry. Not mean to make such a mess and ruin the pony dance.
907008 It's not your fault, sugarcube.
90700c It's the opposite. If anything, we should be apologizing.
907007 I thought we were just teaching you how to have fun at the dance.
90700d We never meant to try to turn you into something you're not.
907187 Is okay. Friend help Yona feel better.
907003 And that's why we're giving you this.
9074e8 Huh?
907188 No way! The Pony Pal prize!
907003 From now on, it's the annual Amity Ball Award for Friendship!
907008 No pony-ness required.
90700c We all decided you and Yona totally earned this.
90700d Your actions tonight exemplify the true meaning of friendship.
907003 Congratulations, you two!
907183 [cheering]
907000 [students cheering]
907005 Yona! I'm glad you're back! Everypony wants to learn that crazy dance you did!
907187 Yak dance? Is easy! Yona teach... if everycreature want to learn?
90700d It would be an honor.
907005 [amplified] You asked for it, and DJ Scales-n-Tail is gonna deliver! Everycreature join Yona for... the Yakyakistan Stomp!
907000 [fast-paced Middle Eastern music plays]
907000 [loud thumping]
907000 [students laughing]
907000 [multiple thumps]
907187 [laughing, chanting "Yak! Yak! Yak!"]
907000 [credits]
908485 [clears throat] I don't want to tattle on my good friend Tirek, but... you might like to know he left food out. Again.
9084cf I'll deal with it when I'm done.
90826d Don't trust anything that nosy little Pegasus says!
9084cf I don't trust anything any of you say.
90826d Hmph!
90819c Are you planning on attacking anypony anytime soon? If not, I don't know why I'm wasting my time here. I am a queen, you know?
9084cf [snorts] I'm leaving, since it's impossible to accomplish the work I need to do here. I suggest the three of you come to some kind of accord.
9084d5 [arguing]
908000 [magic zap]
9084d5 [muffled]
9084cf I don't care how, but you must learn to work together! Only then can we accomplish what you so greatly desire – the defeat of Twilight Sparkle and her friends!
908000 [theme song]
908485 Nothing says "teamwork" like an inspirational banner. When Grogar sees this, he'll realize there's no way he could survive without me!
90826d [grunting]
908485 You're gonna have to exercise a lot to get as big as you were when you absorbed the life force of all those ponies. Anywho, Grogar wants us all to work together, so I've scheduled a team meeting. Doesn't that sound fun? And since Grogar left me in charge...
90826d No, he didn't.
908485 [giggles] Someone's a real grumpy-taur today. If we aren't meeting, I guess I could just stay and offer positive and inspiring—
90826d Fine! I'll join your meeting. Just leave!
908485 See you soon!
90819c It's been weeks, and Grogar's done nothing! It's not healthy to hold on to all of this rage! I could lash out at any moment.
908485 And how are you doing this fine—?
90819c How do you think I'm doing?! I'm ready to exact my revenge! [to hunk of wood] See what I mean?
908485 Being cooped up with nothing to do is the worst! You know what you need? A team meeting!
90819c I don't do meetings.
908485 Grogar left me in charge.
90819c No, he didn't. And even if he did, Chrysalis obeys no one.
908485 [singsongy] There'll be cupcakes.
908485 Grogar wants us to work together to defeat our enemies. Which means we need to trust each other.
90819c [chewing] If we are to trust one another, perhaps inform Lord Tirek to stop trying to absorb my essence!
90826d [spits] I wasn't doing anything of the sort! How dare you!
90819c How dare I?! Do you know to whom you are speaking?
90826d How could I not? You tell your log every five minutes.
908485 This is why Grogar left me in charge.
9084d0 no! he! didn't!
908485 [growls] Huh?
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 I think I know a way that we can grow
908485 Time to try something new, something better
908485 No more solo, trust is the way to go
908485 And all we need to do is work together
90826d Ah, please!
90826d No thanks, no way, I feel the need to say
90826d I'm smarter, stronger, and I don't need you two
90819c Ha!
90819c Stronger? Okay, I guess we'll downplay
90819c How bad you got your rear end handed to you
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 It's time to try a better way to be bad
90826d [groans]
908000 [Lord Tirek and Queen Chrysalis]
908000 Do we really need a better way to be bad?
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 United as one
90819c [Queen Chrysalis]
90819c Teamwork? Please, what a fad
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 Combine all our strength, we'll go to any length
908485 Once we have a better way to be bad
908485 Let's go begin, this time we're gonna win
90819c [Queen Chrysalis]
90819c The ice you're on is thin, so watch what you say
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 I know you're in, I think I see a grin
90826d [Lord Tirek]
90826d For all this pain and torture, I swear you'll pay
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 This time, we've got a better way to be bad
908000 [Lord Tirek and Queen Chrysalis]
908000 Sounds like a long shot, this "better way" to be bad
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 United as one, we'll make those ponies so sad
90826d [Lord Tirek]
90826d If we say "okay", would you just go away?
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 Once we have a better way to be bad
908485 We want to break their friendship
908485 We want to make them weak
908485 You want revenge on Starlight
908485 You want that huge physique
908485 So let's increase our chances
908485 By working as a team
908485 To crush our enemies to dust
908485 And laugh as they all scream!
90804d [laughing evilly]
90826d [Lord Tirek]
90826d I think I see a better way to be bad
90819c [Queen Chrysalis]
90819c Just put me in charge, make me queen, you'll be glad
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 No! Listen to me, I'm the best of us three
90804d [All]
90804d Then you'll see a better way to be bad
908000 [tempo increases]
908485 Wait!
908485 This is my thing, a better way to be bad
90819c [Queen Chrysalis]
90819c You shall do as I command, I will rule this triad!
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 Hey! This is my song!
908000 [Lord Tirek and Queen Chrysalis]
908000 Sorry, not any longer!
90804d [All]
90804d A better way to be bad
908485 [Cozy Glow]
908485 Now you're making me mad
90826d [Lord Tirek]
90826d Won't the ponies be sad?
90819c [Queen Chrysalis]
90819c That would make me so glad
90804d [All]
90804d Now we've got a better way to be baaaaaad!
908485 Hey! You stepped on my cue!
90819c Well, I did not! You stepped on our cue!
90826d Ah, your rhythm was way off!
908485 Oh, you think you're so cool just 'cause you're a queen!
9084cf Enough! I had hoped by now you would've resolved your differences, but apparently not.
90819c Perhaps if we knew what the plan was, we would be better able to prepare!
90826d Assuming you even have a plan.
9084cf Of course I have a plan! I have located an object of power, and it occurs to me this is the perfect test. The three of you will work together to retrieve it. Against this item, those ponies won't stand a chance.
90819c I have come close to ruling Equestria several times. Perhaps I should be the one to lead us.
908485 I nearly drained all the magic from Equestria! That was good!
90826d I absorbed all the magic of Equestria! I could feel it flowing through my body as I grew!
9084d5 [arguing]
908000 [magic zap]
9084d5 [grunt]
9084cf Each of you failed to defeat Twilight Sparkle and her friends! My power is greater than all of yours combined. This is but a fraction of it! Understood?!
9084d5 [various assenting, grunt]
9084cf Now you shall retrieve the rest of it.
9084cf [narrating] Thousands of moons ago, the self-righteous Gusty the Great, unable to best me face-to-face, stole my Bewitching Bell. A talisman containing much of my own magic. The Bell cannot be destroyed, so Gusty hid it in a place it has taken me millennia to discover – an enchanted cave high atop Mt. Everhoof, protected by magical winds that prevent anypony from reaching its peak. There, the Bell has remained until now.
9084cf Scale Mt. Everhoof. Bring me back my Bell.
90819c [laughs] The ease of this task is laughable.
908000 [bird screeches]
90819c Well, it sounded easy.
908000 [bird screeches]
90826d Scale the mountain...
90819c ...retrieve Grogar's Bell...
908485 ...together! I drew up a detailed plan with several visual aids to show how we can... ditch each other and do it alone. Maybe when I'm waiting for them at the top, then they'll appreciate me.
908000 [wind whistling]
908000 [growling]
90819c [hisses]
908000 [whimpering]
90819c As if anything on this mountain is scarier than I. [chuckles]
90826d [blows]
908000 [splat]
90826d [coughs, spits]
908000 [wind whistling]
908000 [door opens, closes]
9084e9 Halt! Who goes there? A pony? There ain't been ponies around here in I-don't-know-how-many moons!
908485 [whimpering] Oh, golly, good sir. I'm just a poor lost pony looking for help.
9084e9 Aw, don't fret, little filly. Ol' Rusty Bucket here, at your service.
908485 I'm so glad I found you. I need help getting to the top of the mountain.
9084e9 Uh, no can do, ma'am.
908485 Why not?!
908000 [rumbling]
9084e9 [lowered] Shhh! Not so loud! This here's avalanche territory. I'm the guardian of this here mountain. It's my job to keep ponies from heading up. Nothing at the top but dangerous snow, dangerous ice, and dangerous wind. Basically, it's dangerous.
908485 It must get lonely all by yourself. Maybe I could be your friend?
9084e9 Aw. I'd love a friend.
908485 So, now that we are friends, you could help me up the mountain.
9084e9 Hmm, uh... a real friend wouldn't ask me to do something I'm not supposed to do. Says so right here in the Journal of Friendship, written by Twilight Sparkle and her friends.
908485 are. you. kidding me?! [echoing]
908000 [birds chirping]
9084e9 Shhhh!
908485 I didn't want to be friends anyway.
9084e9 Awww...
908000 [slipping sounds]
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [crunch!]
908000 [crunch!]
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [transformation noise]
90819c Almost there.
908000 [crunching]
908000 [leaves rustling]
908000 [wind whistling]
908000 [thud]
908000 [snow crunching]
9084e9 Nope. Not that way neither.
9084e9 [yawns]
908000 [rumbling]
908000 [flump!]
908000 [sizzling]
908485 I tried being nice!
908000 [rumbling]
9084e9 Shh-shh-shh! Now, just calm down there, filly.
908485 You calm down! Ponies are supposed to do [echoing] what I ask them to do! It's, like, my thing! Okay?!
908000 [rolling]
908000 [thud]
908485 [screams, fades]
9084e9 Meh.
908000 [door opens, closes]
908000 [wind whistling]
90819c Apparently I don't need anypony else.
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [clawing noises]
908000 [whoosh!]
908000 [thud]
90819c [grunts]
908000 [transformation noise]
90819c [groans] Agh!
908000 [leaves rustling]
908485 [panting]
90826d [laughing]
908485 It's not funny, Tirek!
90826d Didn't make it to the top? Surprise, surprise.
908485 You didn't make it to the top either.
90826d I didn't try to.
908485 What?!
90826d It took about five minutes to deduce that Grogar was right. None of us could make it up alone. So, rather than subject myself to the elements, I decided to let you two face the danger, take what you learned, and use it to my advantage. [laughs]
908485 I put up with your "I'm smarter than you" attitude in Tartarus! But I'm over it!
90826d I'd had enough of you trying to manipulate me with that insincere, syrupy sweetness. At least now we can see the real you.
908485 This is not the real me! I'm cute and lovable!
90826d [scoffs] No, you're not. You're annoying, and you snore.
908485 I do not snore!
90826d [mock-snoring]
908485 At least I don't talk to my Gram-Gram in my sleep.
90826d Don't you dare bring Gram-Gram into this!
908000 [Ophiotaurus roars]
9084ea This is your fault!
908000 [Ophiotaurus roars]
90819c [roars]
908000 [Ophiotaurus grunts softly]
908485 Quick! It's distracted! Let's go!
90826d Wait.
90819c [roars]
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [magic sounds]
90819c [slurps]
908000 [thud]
90819c Mmmm... So much love. I haven't eaten this well in ages.
908485 [gags] So gross.
90819c Just so we're clear, I didn't save you because I like you. I did it because... because I...
908485 Neeeeeeed us?
90819c [gritted] Yes.
90826d Clearly I was right to wait. Now tell me everything you learned today. Leave nothing out.
908485 Why are you doing that? Didn't you already drain it of love?
90819c I always save a little for the next day.
908485 You cocoon all of your... meals?
90819c Of course.
908485 So when you pony-napped Twilight and the others, you cocooned them.
90819c Yes. Until that sow Starlight Glimmer freed them, corrupted my subjects, and stole my hive!
90826d Those ponies have weaknesses. I used that turncoat Discord. Tricked him into helping me capture his so-called "friends".
90819c [sighs] Discord was really something until friendship ruined him.
90826d You should've seen Twilight's face when her friends appeared in bubbles around me. She was all... [exaggerated groaning]
9084eb [laughing]
908485 She's so stressed out all the time.
90819c When I posed as her former foal-sitter, I thought she was going to implode!
9084d5 [laughing]
908485 I wish I could've seen her face when I nearly erased all the magic from Equestria.
90826d All magic was a little excessive, don't you think?
908485 Eh, I think big. Besides, it would've been worth it just to see Twilight and her friends bow down to me!
90826d Indeed it would. Who wouldn't love to see those prissy ponies realize they lost everything?
908000 [transformation noise]
90819c I'm a pathetic pony princess! I made a detailed list of all the ways I'm a failure!
9084ea [laughing]
90826d You know, working with you two may not be the worst thing.
90819c Perhaps... as long as it results in the complete destruction of our enemies.
908485 I wouldn't have it any other way. Do the pathetic princess thing again!
908000 [transformation noise]
9084ea [laughing]
908000 [door opens, closes]
908000 [transformation noise]
90819c [roars]
908000 [rumbling]
908000 [flump!]
9084d5 [laughing]
9084e9 I'm okay!
908000 [transformation noise]
90819c [growls]
908000 [crash!]
908000 [wind whistling]
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [wings flapping]
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [transformation noise]
908000 [zap!]
90819c Aah!
908000 [thud]
908000 [zap!]
90826d [pained groan]
908485 Can you absorb it and make it go away?
90826d I can only absorb magic from living beings.
908485 Like her?
90819c Betrayal!
908485 Not betrayal. Teamwork. If Tirek absorbs your energy, he might be strong enough to break through.
90819c And then?
908485 Then... he gives it back.
90826d I do?
908485 Mm-hmm.
90819c How do I know you won't take my magic and leave me?
908485 Would we do that to you? Okay, normally, yes, we would.
90826d I'll give you your magic back.
90819c Do it.
908000 [magic sounds]
90819c [groaning]
90826d So... much... power! [kisses] Welcome back, baby!
908000 [magic sounds]
90826d It's not big enough for me!
908485 Maybe not you! Keep it open, or I'll be trapped forever!
90819c Would that be so terrible?
90826d [chuckles, grunts] Can't... hold... much... longer! Hurry!
908000 [flump!]
908485 Ta-da!
90819c My magic...
908000 [magic sounds]
90819c I-I wasn't sure you were going to give it back.
90826d Neither was I. But working together seemed smarter than to continue fighting.
908485 When we helped each other, it felt better somehow.
90819c I haven't felt like this since before I lost my hive. Having others who will be there for you is... pleasing.
90826d All of these years taking power from ponies...
908485 When you use your power to help others...
90819c Yes, it feels... nooooooooo!
9084ea Whoa!
90819c The Magic of Friendship is like a disease! An infection that spreads to those around you! I watched it infect my hive! I will not let it get me!
908485 Same.
90826d Obviously.
908485 But... Grogar said we have to work together.
90819c Grogar is too powerful. Something must be done about that. Let Grogar think we're his loyal servants. In the meantime, we'll hatch our own plan.
908485 Ooh... I love a good backstabbing!
90826d After that, we can go back to trying to destroy each other!
908485 In the meantime, what do we do with this?
9084cf You failed to retrieve the Bell?!
908000 [loud thud]
908485 W-W-We're sorry, almighty Grogar.
90826d We worked together as you asked.
90819c We just aren't as powerful as you.
9084cf [angry shout]
908000 [magic zap]
908000 [boom!]
9084cf Obviously! At least you finally did as you were told and worked together.
908485 Of course!
90826d Whatever you command!
90819c Forget about that old bell. You were right. We're so much more powerful... when we work as a team.
908000 [humming]
908000 [credits]
909000 [bird chirping]
909000 [knocking on door]
909000 [door opens]
909186 Uh, Headmare Twilight? Sorry to bug you in the Teachers' Lounge. Is it okay if I miss class?
909003 Mm-hmm. You can make it up tomorrow.
909186 Actually, I'll be gone for a week.
909003 A week?! In the middle of the semester?
90900e Oh, is everything all right, Smolder?
909186 Not exactly. [sighs] My brother's been having a hard time since I left for school. I want to go home and check on him. He's a really sweet guy, and the other dragons can be kind of rough.
909005 Did you say "sweet guy" and "dragon" in the same sentence?
909186 Yeah. He's sort of like you, Spike.
909005 Awww...
909003 I'm sorry to hear about your brother, Smolder. But the Dragon Lands are really far for you to go by yourself. And I'm not sure about you missing so much class.
909005 Hey! What if she got a school credit for it? Kind of like a... a kindness field trip? I'll go with her.
909186 Thanks! The Dragon Lord is way too busy for personal problems when it's baby dragon hatching season.
90900e Baby... dragon... hatching season?! [gasps] All those cute little snouts poking out of those adorable little shells?! Teeny, tiny, twitchy tails?! Can I go too?!
909003 Well, you are the perfect pony to lead a kindness field trip.
909000 [beat]
909003 [sighs] Fine. But I'm gonna expect a full report when you get back.
909186 How many pages?
909003 I was talking to Fluttershy. Hatching season sounds fascinating!
9094ec [laughing]
909000 [theme song]
909005 Okay, I made a list of what cheers me up when I'm down, so if your brother's like me, he's gonna love it! What should we do first? The Smile Song? The sharing circle? Or friendship bracelet weaving?
909186 I'm not sure those are the kind of things my brother's gonna be into.
90900e Well, what would make your brother happy?
909186 Just having Spike and me accept him for who he is will make a huge difference. Dragons who appreciate his more sensitive side.
909005 I got it! Show tunes!
909186 Yeah, no, but good try.
90900e [sniffs] Oh! Uh... [through plugged nose] That's an interesting smell.
909186 [inhales, sighs] The stink of sulfur. Sharp rocks under my claws. [sighs] It's good to be home.
909005 I can't wait to meet your brother, Smolder. We're gonna be best buddies. I just know it.
909186 He usually hangs out near here. I'll go try and find him.
90900e Spike, do you mind if I take a peek at the cute little baby eggs?
909005 No problem. I'll stay here and finish this comfort blanket. It'll be like a hug every time Smolder's brother wraps it around himself.
90900e Awww. I'm sure he'll love it, Spike.
90900e [gasps] Oh... my... goodness! Good morning, little one. I've come a long way to meet you. Did you know there's a whole wide world out here waiting to say hello? Did you? Oh, did you, boo? [baby talk]
9093f6 It can't answer you. It's an egg.
90900e Ah, Dragon Lord Ember. How nice to see you.
9093f6 Nice to see you too... uh... Which one are you again? The party one? Apple Dash! Or was that the country one?
90900e Fluttershy. The one who loves creatures. Are... all these yours?
9093f6 What?! No! None of them are. Watching over eggs is just part of the glamorous life of a Dragon Lord.
90900e I think it sounds wonderful.
9093f6 Yeah? Then maybe you can help.
90900e [gasps] I'd love to! Just tell me what to do!
9093f6 I don't know. It's my first time being in charge. Dad wasn't big on sharing Dragon Lord details. It's kind of a "burn or be burned" job.
90900e Well, I'm sure you're doing great.
9093f6 Not really. The eggs should've hatched by now. But none of them have even cracked.
90900e Oh, dear. Maybe they're lonely? Don't you worry. Auntie Fluttershy's here. And the Dragon Lord and I are gonna do everything we can to welcome you into this world.
9093f6 Really? How?
90900e Um... I have no idea.
909005 Now, that's a thing of beauty. Whoa!
909170 Well, if it isn't our little pony friend Spike.
909005 That's Equestria's official friendship ambassador to the Dragon Lands to you! And I'm not little! I had the molt. See?
9094ed [laughing]
909170 Oh-ho-ho, runt's got wings. I'm soooo impressed. What's that supposed to be?
909005 Nothing! Aah! [grunts]
909170 Looks like a baby blanket to me.
909005 It's not a baby blanket. It's a... comfort blanket.
9094ed [laughing]
909170 Awwww. Did your pony pals make it for you with friendship and gumdrops?
909005 No. I made it. And by the way, knitting's a lot harder than it looks.
909170 Check out the baby blanket, guys! It's a lot harder than it looks! [laughs] Got your bwanky!
909440 Aw, little baby crying?
909005 [panting]
909170 Oh! Missed!
909005 [panting]
909440 Bet he broke a claw and everything. [laughs]
90916f [laughs]
909005 Give it back! That's for my friend!
9094ed [laughing]
909000 [flames roaring]
909005 Cut it out! You know laugh fire's dangerous! It can—!
909000 [burning sounds]
909005 ...do that.
909186 Garble!
909170 Smolder? What are you doing here?
909000 [high-fives]
90916f How's it scalin', brah?
909005 [whispering] We'd better get out of here before your brother shows up. Garble isn't very nice to sensitive dragons.
909186 But Garble is my brother.
909005 Your brother?!
909170 Got a problem with that, pony-boy?
909005 Oh, brother. [teeth chattering]
909005 [whimpering]
909186 I've missed you, bro. We got a lot of fun to catch up on. There's no lava diving at school.
90916f Good luck gettin' Garble to do anything.
909440 Heh, yeah. He's gotten so weird since you left. Hiding and moping around...
909170 I have not!
9094ee Have so!
909186 Easy, guys. I learned at Twilight's school ganging up on each other isn't half as cool as you think.
90916f Awww. Pony school made you soft.
909186 Want to try me and find out?
90916f [gulps] M-Maybe later.
909005 So, uh, let's get lava diving. What do you say?
909440 Better stay here, shrimp. Lava might ruin your blanky-wanky.
909170 Let the wimp tag along. Then we'll have somedragon to dunk! [laughs]
909186 Hmph. Only gonna warn you once. Spike's my friend. You mess with him, you mess with me. Besides, he came here to hang out with you, Garble.
909000 [beat]
9094ee [laughing]
909000 [flames roaring]
909440 [mockingly] Awww. How sweet. Ha!
90916f Let's go do dragon stuff. Garble can have fun with his new friend.
9094ee [laughing]
909000 [flames roaring]
909170 But I'm not having fun! And he's not my friend! [growls]
909186 Eh, just ignore them, "Gar-Gar".
909170 Smolder! Not in public!
909005 Oh, it's okay to have a nickname. Sometimes I'm called "Spikey-Wikey".
909170 Seriously? You're admitting this? [to Smolder] I am not hanging out with him.
909186 Give him a chance, Garble. You guys have a lot in common.
909170 [groans] Fine. Race you to the lava pit.
909005 Wait. I thought you said your brother was sweet.
909186 All the tough guy stuff is just an act. He's a big marshmallow.
909005 Yeah, not seein' it.
909186 Well, maybe a burnt marshmallow. Smoky on the outside, but squishy inside. He just needs friends who can appreciate that part. Like you. You're not changing your mind about helping me cheer him up, are you?
909005 Me? 'Course not! [nervous laugh, sighs]
909186 Okay! Lava jumping! Just like old times, huh, Gar-Gar?
909170 Yeah. Just like old times. Except for one little annoying thing.
909186 Scales away!
909000 [splash]
909186 Come on in! The lava's fine!
909170 [sighs]
909005 You know, whenever I'm feeling a little down, it always helps if I do something with a friend. How about we jump together?
909000 [smack!]
909005 Aah!
909000 [splash]
909000 [bubbling]
909186 Ooh... [winces] Spike? You okay?
909005 [gasps] [stuffed] Uh, I know there must be something worse than lava up your nose. Ah... ah... [sneezes] I just don't know what it is.
909170 Cannonball!
909000 [whistling through air]
909005 Aah!
909000 [splash!]
909170 Woo-hoo! [laughs] Oops?
909005 Ah! [coughing] [strained] Swallowing lava. Swallowing lava's definitely worse.
909170 [insincere] My bad.
90900e [reading] "...And then they all lived happily ever after." Time to come out, little ones. [baby talk] Maybe you'd like a song? [deep breath]
9093f6 I think you might be encouraging them to stay in. Dragons aren't much for touchy-feely stuff.
90900e Oh. I'm sorry.
909000 [rattling]
90900e [gasps] Goodness. Why are the eggs shaking? [gasps] Are they finally hatching?
9093f6 I wish. They've been doing that for days. I'm sure it means something, but it's probably not good.
909005 Try this. Red velvet. Guaranteed to brighten anycreature's spirits.
909000 [smack!]
909000 [splat!]
909000 [squish!]
909170 Feelin' better already.
909005 I dunno about you, but a change of scenery always turns my frown upside-down. Aah!
909000 [flump!]
909005 [under breath] I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon. I will be the bigger dragon.
909005 Sometimes, just hearing what someone appreciates about you can make you feel better about yourself.
909186 I'll go first. Spike, I think it's really nice that you're trying to cheer up Gar-Gar.
909170 [groans]
909005 Thank you, Smolder. My turn. I like how you always let everycreature know how you're feeling, Gar-Gar.
909170 Only Smolder gets to call me that!
909005 [pained groan] Thank you for speaking your truth. [groans]
90916f More fresh lava comin' up!
909000 [crunching]
909000 [bubbling]
909000 [drain sound]
909005 Okay. New activity. Who wants to make vision boards?
909440 Hey, Garble, Smolder! Surf's up!
909000 [splashing]
909170 Let me show you how it's done!
909000 [splashing]
909186 You coming?
909005 I'll... catch up with you.
909000 [splashing]
909005 [sighs]
90900e [sighs] Spike! There you are!
909005 Hey, Fluttershy.
90900e For a land that's all rocks, this place is surprisingly easy to get lost in.
909005 How are the baby dragons doing?
90900e The eggs won't hatch. They just keep shaking. I'm starting to think the dragons are too scared to come out. I was hoping you could help. If you're not too busy cheering up Smolder's brother.
909005 Not a chance. Smolder's brother is Garble.
90900e [gasps]
909005 The only thing that cheers him up is to make me miserable.
909170 Hey, Spike! Want to play lavaball?
909000 [whoosh!]
909005 Huh?
909000 [glop!]
909000 [sizzle!]
90900e Excuse me, but that's not a very nice game!
9094ed [grunting, laughing]
909000 [glop! glop! glop!]
90916f Ah! Nearly got you!
90900e [echoing] ENOUGH!
909000 [splashes]
90900e [clears throat] I mean, leave my friend alone please. Spike came all this way to cheer up Garble, which was a very kind thing to do.
909440 [to Garble, mockingly] Awwww, do you need cheering up?
90916f What's wrong, Garble? Did somedwagon hurt your wittle feelings?
909170 No! I-I don't know what she's talking about! Spike's the one who's gonna cry!
909186 Hey! Are we lava surfing or what?
909170 Uh, yeah, yeah! [nervous laugh] Let's go hang with a real dragon, not a pony wannabe!
9094ed [laughing]
909005 See? It's no use. [sighs] Why don't I see what I can do about the eggs and you cheer up Garble? At least he listens to you.
90900e Just you wait, Garble. You're dealing with Fluttershy now, and she's packin' a whole lifetime of kindness!
9093f6 Oh... Coochie-coochie-coo. [groans] Coochie-coochie-coo. Coochie-coochie-coo! Coochie-coochie. I said coochie—!
909005 Uh, what are you doing?
9093f6 [gasps] Spike!
909005 Hi, Ember!
9093f6 Shouldn't you be doing whatever it is you do at Twilight's school?
909005 I wish. It's a long story. Wow. These eggs really do look scared.
909000 [rattling]
909005 Wait. Aren't the hatching grounds supposed to be hot?
9093f6 Uh, of course. There's a lake of molten lava under them. That's why the eggs are laid here. The heat makes them hatch.
909005 Then something's wrong. I don't think the eggs are shaking because they're afraid. They're cold.
9093f6 You're right! But what happened to the lava?
909005 I might have an idea.
90900e Garble! Smolder! Is anydragon there?
909000 [bongo drums]
90900e Oh, my. Are those... bongo drums?
909170 Fire, dragon. Wig and waggin'. Feelin' like I be saggin'.
90900e [gasps]
909186 [snapping fingers] Oh, yeah. I dig.
909000 [bongo drums]
909170 Ragin' lava. Balaclava.
909186 Huh?
909170 Aah!
90916f Fresh lava comin' up!
909000 [bubbling]
909000 [splash]
909005 See? I wondered where that lava was coming from. They must be draining it from the underground lake.
9093f6 [growls]
909000 [loud thud]
9093f6 Put that rock back! Immediately!
90916f Uh, yes, Dragon Lord Ember!
9093f6 How long have you been removing these boulders?
90916f Uhhhh... a while.
909440 It made our lava pool so nice and warm-like.
9093f6 [growls] It's supposed to be heating the eggs! Now they'll never hatch!
909327 [panicked grunts]
90916f Sorry, Dragon Lord Ember!
909440 We'll put the lava back! [panicked grunts]
90916f [panicked grunts] Here you go, lava! Come on! So difficult! And liquid-y!
909005 I don't think it works that way. The hatching grounds can't be the only warm place in the Dragon Lands. There's got to be somewhere else we can take the eggs.
9093f6 You know how fragile those things are? No way we'll be able to move them all safely. [growls] You! Go and bring all the dragons to the hatching grounds! We'll have to make the heat ourselves!
909170 What do you think you're doing sneaking around here, pony?!
90900e Sneaking? Looks to me like the only one sneaking around is you, Garble. Why didn't you tell me you were a poet?
909170 I'm not!
90900e [gasps]
909000 [bongo drum taps]
909000 [bongo drums]
90900e Words. Rhythm. Sometimes rhyme. Weird punctu... ation. Sure sounds like poetry to me.
909186 It's okay, Gar-Gar. Fluttershy won't think you're soft for being a poet. And neither would anydragon who was your real friend.
909170 [sighs] 'Kay, fine. But I'm not a flowery, namby-pamby poet! I'm a beat poet. Dig?
90900e I totally feel you.
909170 And you better not tell my friends about it!
90900e But why? If I was a poet, I'd want to share my creations with everypony.
909186 I'm the only one Garble will perform for. He hasn't written any poetry since I left. That's why he's been so sad.
909170 I need to create. But if the other dragons ever found out I like this junk, they'd make fun of me forever.
90900e Is that why you pick on Spike? To make your friends think you're tough?
909186 Wait. You've been picking on Spike?
909170 Uh... only when you're not looking. But if I didn't pick on Spike, they'd just pick on me! And he is kind of a weakling.
90900e Hmph! I'll have you know Spike is stronger than you are any day!
909170 Yeah, right! That little cupcake-making, blanket-cuddling pony-dragon? [laughs] Give me a break!
90900e [gasps] First of all, there's nothing wrong with being a pony! Second, Spike isn't afraid to be who he is, no matter what you or anycreature thinks! That's real strength! Not like some dragons I know.
909186 For a pony without a horn, she's sure got a point.
909005 I've been looking all over for you guys! We need your help! Hurry!
909000 [zip!]
909000 [flames roaring]
9093f6 I've ordered everydragon to warm up the eggs, but they still won't hatch. I don't know what else we can try.
909005 We can't give up! There's got to be something we can do!
90916f [mockingly] How about we wrap the eggs in a bunch of baby bwankets? [laughs]
909440 [laughs] Yeah! The wimp can knit 'em up quick-like!
909005 Hey, watch it! That laugh fire could burn somepony!
909327 [laughing]
909170 Burn... Good idea, Spikey-Wikey!
909000 [zip!]
909327 [stop laughing]
909000 [bongo drums]
909170 Eggs, come. Burst into that light. Break through shells that bind.
909005 [snaps fingers]
909170 Break free, explore. Stuck! ...Between rock and... hard place.
909000 [beat]
909327 [laughing]
909000 [flames roaring]
909170 Freedom, come! Don't be shy! Look those others in the eye!
909327 [uproarious laughing]
909000 [flames roaring]
909170 Stake your claim! Don't stop! Just do! Be the one and only... you!
909327 [uproarious laughing]
909000 [cracking]
90900e Spike, look!
909005 What? Huh?! Their laugh fire's so hot, it's hatching the eggs!
909170 Come to light! Proud to be! Open up! Bam! Be... free!
909327 [uproarious laughing]
909000 [cracking]
909186 You did it, Gar-Gar! You performed in front of other dragons!
909440 [laughs] And it was super lame! What kind of weakling writes poetry?
9093f6 The hero of the Dragon Lands! That's who!
909186 Yeah! Garble saved our eggs because he was strong enough to be who he is, whether you liked it or not. I grew up thinking it was okay to make fun of differences. But my friends have taught me to celebrate them.
909327 [grunting]
9093f6 And from now on, in my kingdom, that's exactly what we will do. Now, if you don't mind, can you teach me how to write poetry like that? It's pretty cool.
909170 Uh... yeah, sure. No problem!
909440 Yeah, me, too!
90916f I want to learn!
909005 Take a number, guys.
90900e I'll take them all! [giggling]
909000 [credits]
910000 [rooster yawns, crows]
910028 [eating]
910008 I know we've had this day marked on the calendar for quite a while, but it's finally here.
910026 Eeyup.
91000a Sure is.
910009 What?
910008 The Confluence. A harvest a hundred moons in the makin'. When every apple comes ripe at the same time. Big Mac's been up late workin' on this schedule so we can be sure not to miss a single tree. All it'll take now is a few days o' hard work. Who's with me?
910026 [snoring]
91000a [groans] That looks like a lot of work.
910009 Aw, don't you worry, chick-a-bidee. We got this Confluence under control. I got us some help.
910008 That's great, Granny! Twilight and the others are too busy at the school to lend a hoof. We could sure use some more muscle. Who'd you get? Braeburn? Honeycrisp?
910009 [chuckles] Even better.
910000 [muffed meowing]
910000 [thud]
910000 [door opens]
910000 [cats meowing]
910214 Howdy, y'all!
910000 [scritching]
910026 [pained yelling]
910000 [thud]
910214 Mm-hmm. Now, that's how you wake a pony up.
91000a Goldie Delicious!
910214 Granny told me y'all could use a helpin' hoof with this here Confluence, so I came a-runnin'.
910008 Well, with a harvest this big, we're grateful for all the help we can get. I guess.
910026 Eeyup.
910214 It's too bad y'all ain't ever caught the Great Seedling. He'd have granted you a perpetual harvest, Confluence or no.
91024e [laugh]
910008 The Great Seedlin'? Well now. I haven't thought about that old mare's tale for years.
910214 The Great Seedlin' ain't no mare's tale! He's a magical Earth spirit...
910214 [narrating] All the colors of the harvest that travels from farm to farm daring ponies to catch him. And those that have the ingenuity are rewarded with crops that are always in bloom.
910214 And he's as real as you and me!
910009 As I'm up to recall, Apple Bloom used to love settin' traps for the Great Seedlin' when she was a young'un. [laughs]
910026 [laughs]
910008 Well, I'm pretty sure she's outgrown the whole thing by now. Right, Apple Bloom?
910000 [beat]
91000a Or maybe I'm big enough now to finally catch him! Who's with me?!
910000 [theme song]
910008 Apple Bloom, you haven't hunted for the Great Seedlin' since you were little. Why would you want to start again now?
91000a The Confluence is so big! He's bound to show up! And if we catch him, he'll make all the apples ripe all the time! Right, Goldie?
910214 Mm-hmm. That's right, young filly.
91000a [laughs] Just imagine. Sweet Apple Acres would be the busiest orchard in Equestria! Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do!
910000 [door opens]
910008 Don't forget we have actual work to do, too!
910214 Nothin' like a little filly enjoyin' the harvest. [chuckles]
910008 I don't mind Apple Bloom havin' fun. But there's honest-to-goodness work to do that doesn't have a thing to do with an old legend.
910009 Aw, quit worryin', sugar booger. Apple Bloom can hunt for the Seedlin' all she wants. If you're so fret-a-fied about work, why don't you and your brother get to buckin' your own selves?
910008 Granny's right.
910000 [cat yowls]
910008 Come on, sleepyhead. Let's get to work.
910026 [yawns] Eeyup...
910000 [cat yowls]
910000 [thud]
910008 Hyah! Hwah!
910000 [apples thudding]
910009 [chuckles] ...and if you had two o' them, it would've been a "pair o' pears"!
9104ef [laughing]
910000 [crack]
910008 As much as I appreciate her volunteerin', I'm not sure how much help Goldie's gonna be.
910214 Oh, now, that reminds me of the time Dottie – that's my cheetah, you understand – she found out where I keep the catnip.
9104ef [laughing]
910008 I love hearin' her and Granny spinnin' yarns, but it looks like the harvestin's up to us. You're gonna have to redo that schedule.
910026 [sighs] Eeyup.
910008 And as much as I'd rather Apple Bloom were helpin', I guess there's no harm in her huntin' the Great Seedlin' for a day. Right? Big Mac!
910026 [snores, yells]
910000 [thud]
910000 [whip!]
910026 [yells]
91000a Gotcha! Awww. You ain't the Great Seedlin'.
910026 Nope.
910000 [whap!]
910000 [rooster crows]
910000 [sizzling]
910008 We fell behind a bit yesterday, so we need everypony at their best.
910000 [cat meows]
910214 If that's your brother's best, we might be done for. Mm-hmm.
910000 [hooves rattling]
910000 [thud]
910008 He was just up late workin' out a new schedule so we can stay on track.
91000a I didn't sleep either! I was too excited! I can't wait to see if I caught the Great Seedlin'!
910000 [door opens]
910008 I hope you're ready to cheer Apple Bloom up when her traps come up empty.
91000a Everypony! Come quick! You got to see!
910008 What in blazes is all the excitement about?
91000a Look!
910000 [whimsical music]
91000a The Great Seedlin' did this! Didn't he?!
910214 Well, braid my mane! These sure look like Great Seedlin' tracks to me!
91000a Ha! I knew it! He was here! The Great Seedlin' was here! Ain't that amazin', Applejack?!
910008 Yeah... Amazin'...
910214 [laughs]
91000a [gasps] Isn't it beautiful? I just can't believe the Great Seedlin' was really here!
910008 Neither can I.
91000a What do you think this means?
910214 [laughs] Well, it looks to me like a challenge. The Seedling wants you to know that he was here, and he's daring you to catch him. Mm-hmm.
91000a You think I still have a chance?
910009 You're an Apple, ain't ya?
910214 Why, if you set enough traps, you're bound to catch him.
91000a You're right! And that's just what I'm gonna do! Look out, Great Seedlin'! Here I come! [giggles]
9104ef [laughing]
910008 Now, why would you go and do a thing like that?
910214 A thing like what?
910008 You know what I mean. We got enough work to do without you distractin' Apple Bloom by makin' some apple tracks and pretendin' the Great Seedlin' did it.
910214 [gasps] I did no such thing!
910009 What in the tater tarnation would make you say a thing like that?!
910008 Well, somepony did it. And she sure seems to be enjoyin' this quite a lot.
910214 I'm enjoyin' it because Apple Bloom's enjoyin' it!
910008 Uh-huh. And I suppose you two didn't do it either?
910026 Nnnope.
910009 O' course not. But I suppose it could've been Goldie's cats! Why don't you ask them?
910000 [cat meows]
910214 Have you considered that maybe it was the Great Seedlin' after all?
910008 Ha-ha. Very funny.
910009 I swear, sometimes I think she's part mule.
910000 [clattering]
910008 Apple Bloom?
91000a You know where there's more rope? I've got a lot of traps to make if I'm gonna catch the Great Seedlin'.
910000 [toy squeaks]
910008 That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I know you're excited, but we sure could use your help today. Are you sure you want to spend time tryin' to catch somethin' that... might not even be real?
91000a What? But the Great Seedlin' is real. You saw the tracks. You think those appeared all by themselves?
910008 I don't know who made the tracks. But I don't think it was the Great Seedlin'.
91000a Why not?
910008 Because the Great Seedlin' is just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns. And you're old enough now to know that there's a time for fun and there's a time for work.
91000a But catchin' the Great Seedlin' is helpin'! He can make the trees blossom all the time!
910008 [sighs] All right. How about this? If you help me with the harvest today, I'll help you set traps for the Great Seedlin' tonight. Deal?
91000a Woo-hoo! Yes! It's a deal!
910000 [apples thudding]
910000 [barrels creaking]
910000 [thunk!]
910000 [apples thudding]
910008 Kinda looks like those Seedlin' tracks, huh?
91000a Sure. If there were hundreds of apples in a bunch of different lines.
910008 Well, if enough apples fell or got knocked down by the wind maybe. Or animals.
910000 [beat]
910008 I'm just sayin' there's a lot of possible explanations.
910214 And one o' them is the Great Seedlin'!
910008 And the rest of 'em ain't!
910009 That ain't what you thought when you was a foal.
91000a What does that mean?
910009 Your sister was plumb loco about catchin' the Great Seedlin' when she was your age. Same as you are now. Worse, even.
910214 Oh, is that so? Do tell, Granny.
910009 Well, it must've been the last Conflu-inky, I reckon. I was supposed to keep an eye on your sister, but...
910009 [voiceover] ...she was slipperier than an apple seed.
910009 Applejack! Get your flank back here! You're supposed to be sortin' in the barn!
9100af Sorry, Granny! I got to check my traps, or the Great Seedlin' might get away!
910000 [leaves rustling]
9100af Now, where'd I put that trap?
910000 [twig snaps]
9100af [gasps] Whoa!
910000 [thud]
910009 Bust my buds. Where's that young'un get to?
910009 [voiceover] She spent the better half of the day stuck in that trap! [laughs]
910008 [voiceover] And missed out on helpin' with the harvest because I was chasin' somethin' for little foals. I felt guilty everypony else had to work harder because of me. So I decided right then and there I was too old to waste any more time on Great Seedlin'.
910009 Oh, we finished the harvest just fine. But we laughed about that story for years! [laughs]
910214 [laughs] I'm still laughin'!
91000a I'm sorry that happened, Applejack, but it won't if you and me set traps together like you promised. Plus, we'll get 'em done twice as fast and won't miss out on any of the harvest!
910008 Then let's get to work.
91000a [gasps]
910000 [montage music]
910000 [rope stretching]
910000 [twang!]
910000 [snap!]
910000 [crunch!]
910000 [leaves rustling]
910000 [thud]
910000 [apples thudding]
910000 [cats meowing]
910028 [barking, yelps]
910000 [thud]
910028 [panting]
910000 [tree straining]
910000 [twang!]
910000 [thud]
910000 [cans clattering]
910000 [leaves rustling]
91000a [laughs] It sure was fun settin' up all those traps together.
910008 [laughs] I forgot what a good time it could be. If any two ponies can catch the Great Seedlin', it's us.
91000a I can't wait to check in the mornin'.
910008 Now, there's still plenty of harvestin' to do. So promise me you'll help, even if all our traps are empty.
91000a I promise. So long as you're ready for the bountiful harvest the Great Seedlin's gonna give us when one of our traps nab him!
910008 [laughs] Deal.
910000 [door opens]
910000 [rooster crows]
910000 [rumbling]
9100ff [panting]
91000a Come on, Applejack! If we hurry, we can check every trap and still stay on schedule!
910008 Now that's what I like to hea—
910000 [whimsical music]
910008 Whoa.
91000a [gasps] I don't believe it!
910214 This must've taken all night.
910000 [smack!]
910026 Eeyup.
91000a Nothin'!
910008 Huh?
91000a I checked all the traps near the tracks! Every one was sprung, but they're all empty!
910008 Every trap sprung? No way critters did this. Or the wind. I can't believe I'm sayin' this, but... maybe the Great Seedlin' really was here!
910214 So, you're finally ready to admit the Great Seedling might be real?
910008 I can't think of anything else that could've laid out these tracks and sprung all our traps.
91000a And if he left this many tracks behind, he's practically beggin' us to catch him!
910009 I ain't never seen anything like this before.
910008 Well, tell us what you have seen! Goldie, you too! We need to know it all if we're really gonna catch him!
910009 Sure, Goldie and I'll tell you all about the Great Seedling all day. While we work.
910008 Work? Apple Bloom and I don't have time to work today! We've got to set up traps in every row! Even the carrots! Just to be sure!
91000a Yesterday you said the Great Seedlin' was just somethin' to make the harvest fun for young'uns.
910008 That was before I thought we could actually catch him! Besides...
910026 [yawns]
910008 ...Big Mac can make time in the schedule for us to set traps, right?
910026 Uh... eeyup?
910008 Great! Get to it! Apple Bloom and I are gonna go capture us the Great Seedlin'!
910026 [sighs]
910000 [thud]
910000 [apples thudding]
910000 [multiple thuds]
910000 [apples thudding]
910000 [barrel creaking]
910026 [wheezes]
910000 [multiple thuds]
910000 [thud]
910000 [leaves rustling]
910028 [barking]
910008 Whew! All right! Just one more hill to go!
91000a What's wrong, Big Mac?
910008 Huh. Is this right?
910026 Eeyup.
910008 But that doesn't make any sense. How can all these trees be bare if we haven't bucked 'em yet?
910214 Seems like more work of the Great Seedlin' to me.
91000a How do you mean?
910214 The closer you get to catchin' the critter, the more mischievous he gets.
910008 You're sayin' the Great Seedlin' is takin' our apples?
910009 Yes. Sounds like he's fixin' to throw you off the scent.
910000 [thudding]
910000 [cats meowing]
910008 Have you ever heard of anypony actually catchin' him?
910214 Oh, there are stories. But it's hard to say for sure. He's quite a trickster. Guess that's why the reward is so great if you can trap him.
910008 Well, his tricks have given me an idea. Settin' traps is one thing. But I reckon if we keep watch over the trees that haven't been bucked, the Seedlin' won't know what hit him!
91000a That's a great idea! Anypony else want to stay up with us?
910009 Ah, no. A pony like me needs her beauty rest. But you young'uns have a good time.
910214 My kitties can't sleep unless they're curled up on my haunches. [titters] But I can't wait to see the Great Seedlin' with my own eyes once you catch him.
910008 Guess it's just you and me.
910000 [paper tears]
91000a Too bad nopony else wanted to come out. But I'm glad we're doin' this together.
910008 [chuckles] Me, too. It's been a long time since I was on a real Seedlin' hunt. And this is the first time doin' it with my little sister.
91000a [yawns] When did you start tryin' to catch the Great Seedlin'?
910008 I couldn't have been much more than a foal. I remember our parents tuckin' Big Mac and me in and tellin' us all about the Great Seedlin'. And I got so excited, I could barely sleep. So I—
91000a [snoring]
910008 Don't you worry, sugarcube. I won't let him get away.
910008 [snoring]
910000 [clatter!]
91000a [yelps]
910000 [thud]
910000 [apples thudding]
91000a [whispering] Applejack, wake up!
910008 Huh? W-What is it?
91000a [whispering] I think a trap went off!
910008 Well, let's go check it out!
910008 See anything?
91000a Mm-mm.
910008 Don't scare him off. We got to lead him into one of the traps.
91000a [whimpers] I'm not worried about scarin' him.
910000 [galloping]
910000 [twig snaps]
910000 [leaves rustling]
910000 [thud]
910000 [apples thudding]
910000 [cans clattering]
91000a I think the Great Seedlin's huntin' us! [screams]
910008 Apple Bloom! Wait!
91000a [panting]
910000 [twang!]
910008 [panting] Huh?
91000a [whimpering] Applejack!
910008 Huh?
9100ff [scream]
910008 [panting]
910000 [thudding]
910000 [rattling]
910026 [snoring]
9100ff Big Mac?!
910008 He's been harvestin' in his sleep this whole time!
91000a Big Mac is the Great Seedlin'?!
910026 [mumbling] Aah!
910000 [whiffle!]
910000 [thud!]
910008 Y-You okay, Big Mac?
910026 Nnnope.
9100ff [laugh]
910008 ...And thanks to all of Big Mac's late-night work, we brought in the whole harvest with time to spare.
910214 No wonder you were so tired all the time.
910026 Eeyup.
91000a I'm glad we solved the mystery, but I really wanted to catch the Great Seedlin' before I get too old to try.
910008 You know what, sugarcube? You're never too old to be a filly. There will always be work to do, but havin' fun together is somethin' you never grow out of.
910028 [panting]
910214 Well, looks like you don't need me anymore. Time to get home before Dottie gets in the catnip again. I have stories about that, I'll tell you what.
910008 [chuckles] We're real glad you came, Goldie.
91000a Sure are! Come back next year!
910214 [whistles]
910000 [cats meowing]
910214 Oh. Looks like you forgot to clean up the carrots.
910008 Huh. Big Mac wasn't harvestin' the carrots. Just the apples.
910026 ["I-don't-know" sound]
910000 [whimsical music]
910008 You know what this means?
91000a Time for another hunt!
910008 Look out, Great Seedlin'! Here we come!
910000 [credits]
911037 I know how hard you've been working lately, so I figured you could use a break.
91127c [gasps] Trixie, this looks amazing! But my job doesn't really seem like work.
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c Oh! Speaking of...
911000 [teleportation zap]
911037 [sighs, blows, sips]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Sure, being counselor for the students at Twilight's School of Friendship is demanding, but—
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c Oh. One sec.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911037 [sips]
911000 [spoon clattering]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c What was I saying? Oh, right. Being able to use the experiences of my checkered past and help young students feels pretty great. Oh, yum! [chomps] Mmm, thanks!
911037 Of course I feel nothing but admiration for the work you do, but it is a little all-consuming. And I miss spending time with you.
91127c What are you talking about? We're spending time right now.
911037 Well...
91127c [chewing]
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c [mouth full] Hold that thought.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911037 [growls, chomps]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c [sighs] Sorry. I cast a spell on the door to my office so this bracelet goes off whenever there's a knock. Yona is having the worst time with her braids lately. [sips] Anyway, you were saying?
911037 [sips]
91127c [laughs nervously]
911000 [theme song]
911185 I totally respect my younger cousins' decisions to stay seaponies, but they've never been on dry land. Preparing for a visit with them is almost as much work as the research assignment Headmare Twilight gave me on hazardous fauna of the Everfree Forest! How would you describe a shower to creatures who live in water? So far, I've got "warm" and "steamy". Actually, steam has water in it.
91127c Silverstream, there are a lot of students who want to see me today.
911185 I just need a few shower adjectives... that don't rely on the wet part.
91127c [sighs] Well, there's "clean", "relaxing", um...
911185 "Relaxing"... I don't know. A nap's relaxing, too. "Warm" and "clean" are okay. Wow. I have to give this some more thought.
91127c Oh. Okay. Well, I'm here to help. My door is always open.
911037 Except for today, of course.
911000 [door closes]
9114f0 [whimpers]
911037 If we leave now, we can finish everything before sundown.
91127c Trixie, I-I can't leave. It's almost spring break. Twilight and the others have already left to celebrate the spring solstice in Canterlot, and I have to help the students with any issues before they head home for the holiday.
911000 [bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
911000 [door opens]
911000 [door closes]
911037 I know you're busy, but I hope you haven't forgotten about the Spring Solst-astic!
911000 [beat]
911037 The party Maud and Mudbriar are throwing?
911000 [beat]
911037 Sunburst is coming to town?
911000 [beat]
911037 You and I promised to make the cake?
91127c [scoffs] How could I possibly forget about that?
911000 [bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
911000 [door opens]
911037 [low growl]
911000 [door closes]
911037 Nopony is saying your job isn't important, but plans you make with your friends are important, too.
91127c [sighs] I know. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have forgotten. Obviously I need to be available to my students, but that doesn't mean I can't help with all the things we have to do.
911037 Good!
91127c Great!
911000 [beat]
91127c So... what are all the things we have to do?
911037 [whines] Maud needs streamers for the decorations. Sunburst wants us to pick up a genuine pre-Equestrian spring solstice chafing dish from the antique shop.
91127c Of course he does.
911037 Mudbriar wants a bouquet of flowering sticks – whatever that means. And I thought we were both looking forward to Mrs Cake teaching us the secret recipe to her famous spring solstice cake.
91127c Oh! I-I totally am! [chuckles] But we could just buy a cake from her, right?
911037 We could... but then we'd miss out on baking together. Plus, the time I spent flattering and convincing and begging her to share the recipe with you for nothing! And we promised to make a cake, not buy a cake! And the Great and Powerful Trixie keeps her promises!
91127c Okay! Why don't we just split up these jobs? I'll get the streamers and the chafing dish. You—
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c —get started on those sticks, and I'll be right back! [laughs nervously] You know, why don't I just hang on to this? Wouldn't want to forget the things I just said I'd take care of. Because I am totally gonna take care of them!
911000 [teleportation zap]
91102f Could it be plum blossom?
911037 I have no idea.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911037 [yelps]
911000 [thud]
91127c Whoops! Heh. Sorry, Rose. But I need a bouquet of flowering sticks, stat!
911037 I thought I was getting the flowering sticks.
91102f Uh, I'm still not exactly sure what they are.
911037 No one is.
91127c Right. Got it. You get the sticks. I'll get the streamers—
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c —riiiight after I take care of what I'm sure is an even smaller student problem than the last one! [laughs nervously]
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [glue squirting]
911185 I think I have the shower thing under control. But I can't figure out how to describe a towel.
911000 [bracelet chiming]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Now, Smolder, I understand the school can be a bit drafty, but that doesn't mean you can breathe fire anywhere you want!
91127c What do you mean Trixie already picked up Sunburst's genuine pre-Equestrian equinox chafing dish?! That was my job! I think. Wait. Was it?
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c [groans]
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [transformation zaps]
91127c Ocellus, it's perfectly normal for a changeling to struggle with identity issues, but—
911185 Counselor Starlight!
911000 [door opens]
911185 When you're done, I need some synonyms for the word "dry". Or, really, just help explaining the concept.
911000 [door closes]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Wait, Mrs Cake! You can't close! Trixie and I need to learn the recipe for your equinox cake!
91102a Oh, it's fine, dear. Trixie was already here. I told her everything she needs to know.
91127c What? No! Aww! The Great and Powerful Trixie might keep her promises, but the Busy and Distracted Starlight sure doesn't. I promised to help her today, and I haven't done a single thing.
91102a Oh, that doesn't sound hard, dear. A-And I'm not quite sure how to tell you this, but [whispering] your hoof is glowing.
911000 [bracelet chiming]
91127c Of course it is.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [click]
91127c Trixie? What are you doing here?
911037 It's the one place I knew I could find you.
91127c I am so sorry about today. I'm just so—
911037 Busy. I know. Obviously your students are more important than your friends.
91127c That's not—!
911000 [bracelet chiming/knocking on door]
911000 [door opens]
911185 Starlight, you have a minute?
91127c Actually, Silverstream, I don't. Besides, I need to lock up the school for the holiday, and it's time you caught the train home. I'm sure a smart and capable student like you can figure out the solution to any problem over the break. But for now, the counselor's office is closed.
911000 [door closes]
91127c I have a cake to bake.
911000 [clatter]
911315 Yow! Is this cake supposed to be so sharp?
911037 [growls]
911315 I mean, it looks really... interesting?
91144f Technically, it's not symmetrical or aesthetically pleasing.
911037 [growls]
91127c Maybe it's not the best cake. But we made it together, and that's what counts.
911242 [deadpan] I'm glad you brought it. And everything else. I'm very excited. This is going to be the most perfect party ever.
911037 And with all of your students home for the holiday, I won't have to worry about you being summoned to your office in the middle of it.
91127c Mm-hmm. Nothing is gonna take me away from this party.
91146c Hello?! Starlight?!
91127c [spits]
91146c Starlight?!
911242 [deadpan] Sorry. This is a private cavern.
91146c Is Starlight here?! I was told she'd be here!
91127c What's wrong?
91146c I'm Terramar, Silverstream's brother. I've been looking all over for you. Silverstream is missing!
91127c [gasps]
911037 [chewing]
91127c I don't understand. Silverstream didn't come home?
91146c Mm-mm. I was supposed to meet her at the Mount Aris train station, but she never showed up!
911315 It's a long way between Ponyville and Mount Aris. She could be anywhere.
91146c Our parents are leading teams of Hippogriffs and seaponies, searching the land and sea between here and our home. They sent me to check the school.
91127c But the school's closed. All the students are gone.
91146c Are you sure? I know she had a big project due for Twilight. Do you think she might've stayed to finish it?
91127c She never told me about a project.
911037 Well, to be fair, you closed your office the last time she came by.
91127c Really?
911037 [short laugh]
91146c What kind of counselor turns away a student with a problem?!
911037 The kind with too much on her plate! Starlight has always gone out of her way for her students. And I mean always.
91127c Except apparently when it matters. This is all my fault! You all go back to the party. Terramar and I will check the school. We'll find your sister.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911242 [deadpan] I should've known it couldn't last. Party perfection is more of a Pinkie thing.
91144f Mm. I wasn't going to say anything, but these flowers are just glued on, so technically, it wasn't perfect already.
911000 [beat]
91144f But that's probably not important.
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c You check the grounds, and I'll look inside.
911000 [doors open]
91127c Silverstream?
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c [echoing] Hello?
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zaps]
91127c Anycreature?!
911000 [splash]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91146c [panting] She's not down here.
91127c I don't see her anywhere.
91146c Did you check her room?
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Well, she's not here.
91146c No, she isn't. But look at this.
91127c A cockatrice?
91146c Could that be what her project was on? You don't think she went into the Everfree Forest to find a cockatrice by herself, do you?
91127c I don't know, but I'm going to find out.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c [laughs nervously]
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91104d [yelps]
91127c What are you all doing here?
911315 We came to help.
911037 We couldn't let you handle this alone.
91144f Technically, she wasn't alone.
911000 [beat]
91144f But we wanted to help anyway.
91127c Thanks. All of you. But the students are my responsibility. I'm the one who didn't do my job when it actually mattered.
911037 I... might share a bit of the blame for pressuring you into leaving work early.
91127c But I don't want to ruin your party.
911242 [deadpan] We can still have a party. A search party.
91146c Can we talk about all this later? Silverstream might be in the Everfree Forest alone!
9114f1 [gasp]
91127c We think she went in to do research on cockatrices.
911315 What?! The gaze of the cockatrice is known to petrify any who dare to cross its path! And the reptilian birds are elusive and solitary! W-Where would we even start?!
911037 I have a lot of experience telling ponies that I have experience with the dangerous creatures of Everfree Forest! Follow me!
911000 [zip!]
911000 [tense music]
911037 The Great and Directionally Astute Trixie says we go left!
911037 This way!
911037 [sniffs]
911000 [wind whistling]
911000 [owl hoots]
911037 [slurp, chews, spits]
911242 [deadpan] Weren't we just here?
91127c Trixie, do you have any idea how to find a cockatrice?
911037 No. But usually, when there's a dangerous creature in the forest I don't want to meet, this is how I meet them.
911315 We might need a more concrete plan.
911037 Hmph. Suit yourself.
91146c Um, according to Silverstream's research, the cockatrice prefers rocky terrain and ample shade.
911037 Rocks and shade. Hmm. I can't imagine where we'll find that in a forest.
911242 [deadpan] Actually, rocks aren't the most hospitable environment for shade trees.
91144f Technically, pine trees like Pinus cembra or Pinus sylvestris can grow from narrow crevasses or cracks in a rocky rhizosphere.
911242 [deadpan] You complete me.
91127c There's some pine trees over there!
911000 [cockatrices clucking and hissing]
91127c [whispering] I thought you said they were solitary!
911315 [whispering] They are! This must be some kind of migration.
91146c [whimpers] At least there's no sign of Silverstream. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of that flock.
911037 [whispering] It's just lucky we're all over here and they're all over there.
911000 [cockatrice hisses]
91144f Technically—
911037 [whispering] Don't even say it!
91127c Whatever you do, don't look at them. Their gaze can turn you to stone.
91146c [whispering] So what do we do?
911000 [cockatrices hiss]
911315 Ruuuuun!
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [cockatrices squawk]
911315 [screaming]
911000 [thud]
911315 [groans, babbles]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Sunburst!
911000 [magic zap]
91147c Aah!
91127c Stop! It's me!
911315 Starlight! I'm so sorry. We have to get out of here.
91127c I know. Hang on.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c We can't leave Silverstream might still be in the forest. Stay here. I'll get the others.
911000 [teleportation zap]
911315 Be careful!
911000 [clucking and hissing]
91146c The clucking is coming from everywhere!
911037 The Great and Powerful Trixie fears no cluck!
911000 [poof!]
911000 [cockatrices hiss]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Come on!
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [cockatrices hiss]
911000 [teleportation zap]
911315 Aah!
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [cockatrices hiss]
911000 [teleportation zap]
91127c Maud! We've got to get out of here!
911242 [deadpan] I'm not leaving him.
91127c [gasps]
911000 [teleportation zap]
911000 [teleportation zap]
9114f2 [gasps]
911315 Mudbriar's been turned to stone?!
911242 [deadpan] I didn't think I could love him any more.
911037 We've got to get out of here!
91146c But we haven't found Silverstream! We can't leave yet!
911000 [cockatrices hiss]
91127c Well, we can't stay here! Come on!
911000 [cockatrices hissing]
911000 [leaves rustling]
911000 [cockatrice clucks]
91127c [screams]
911000 [cockatrices hissing]
91127c This way!
911000 [cockatrices hiss]
911000 [doors open]
911000 [doors close]
911000 [thudding]
911037 Now what?!
911315 Let's hope Silverstream found a good place to hide. There could be hundreds more cockatrices on the way. If this really is a migration, it'll take a full lunar cycle to complete.
91146c Ohhh. I have to get word back to our parents that Silverstream could be surrounded by those terrifying birds!
911242 [deadpan] And as handsome as Mudbriar is now, we should probably catch one of them to turn him back to normal.
91127c [groans] This is all my fault. I'm never taking time off from my counseling duties again.
911037 That seems a little extreme.
91127c Really?! If I hadn't galloped off to a holiday celebration, Silverstream would be safe with her family, and you'd all be enjoying Maud's party! Instead, my student is missing, we're surrounded by a flock of petrifying chicken-snakes, and Maud's boyfriend was turned into a hunk of rock!
911242 [deadpan] You got the "hunk" part right.
91127c And to top it off, we have no idea if Silverstream even came to Everfree at all! But I have no idea where else to look!
911037 Has that always been there?
91127c What? Oh, that's the students' treehouse. Apparently it grew from the Tree of Harmony and— [gasps] Of course! That should've been the first place we looked!
911000 [scraping]
911000 [door opens]
91127c [sighs, gasps] Silverstream, look out!
911185 Counselor Starlight, no!
9114f3 [hisses]
911185 Wait!
911000 [magic humming]
9114f3 [clucking softly]
911185 This is Edith. She's helping me with my project.
91127c I... don't understand.
911185 After you encouraged me to solve my own problem, I decided to get my project done before I left. That way, I could really focus on my family during my visit. The school was closed, so I came here.
91146c Why didn't you tell anyone? Mom and Dad are worried sick!
911185 Oh, no! I'm so sorry! Once Edith volunteered to help, I guess I lost track of time. Cockatrices are really friendly if you know how to interact with them.
9114f3 [clucking softly]
911315 I can't believe you figured out how to trigger her nesting response.
911185 They are really fascinating creatures. Did you know that they migrate to the Everfree Forest once a year? Can you imagine what would happen if you stumble on a whole flock of these?
91127c I have a few ideas.
911185 [gasps]
911185 I'm sorry you got turned to stone looking for me. But I'm glad Edith was able to turn you back.
911315 [hushed, to Trixie] How do you tell the difference?
911242 [deadpan] I have mixed feelings about it.
91144f Technically, I will always be a stick pony. But the experience has given me an even deeper appreciation for the density and permanence of rock.
911242 [deadpan] Swoon.
91146c Silverstream and I should get going. But I wanted to thank you for everything you did to help find her.
91127c I just wish I hadn't abandoned her in the first place.
911037 Starlight, you didn't abandon her.
91127c I might as well have. Even though it turned out all right, things could've been a lot worse.
911315 You can't be expected to supervise your students every second of every day.
91127c I'm not so sure.
911185 I like that you're always available, but it kind of makes it okay to come to you with stuff that maybe isn't super important.
911037 Of course being a school counselor is a big responsibility. But always being at work isn't fair to anypony. Especially me.
91127c Do you think if I had set times to see me, it might help you decide what you really need to talk about?
911185 To be honest, you really weren't very helpful with the other stuff anyway.
91127c Yeah— Wait, what?!
911037 Happy Spring Solst-astic, everypony! Who wants a piece of Mrs Cake's famous—?
911000 [clang!]
911315 Petrified dessert?
911242 [deadpan] You had me at "petrified".
91143b [laughing]
911000 [credits]
912428 [panting] Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders! Cutie Mark Crusaders!
912065 We're at my house!
912000 [door opens]
912428 I got my cutie mark!
912066 You did?
912080 That's great, Skeedaddle!
912065 Yeah! What's it for?
912428 Knot-tying! And I never would've gotten it without all of you!
91200a Did we suggest knot-tying?
912428 [to Sweetie Belle] First, I tried sailing, like you said. [to Scootaloo] Next, I tried fishing, like you said. [to Apple Bloom] Then, I tried rowing, like you said. But my oar broke. So I used my fishing line to tie it back together, and I got my cutie mark! [squeals] I can't wait to tell everypony!
912000 [zip!]
912000 [door closes]
912080 [cheer]
9124f4 Oh, how exciting. You three truly have a gift for helping ponies.
912065 Aw, thanks, Aunt Holiday. But I'm not sure we can take credit for this one.
9124f4 Of course you can. You encouraged that colt to try new things. And because you all believed in him, he succeeded.
9124f5 I could use that kind of help. Huh.
912065 [laughs] Come on, Auntie Lofty. You already have your cutie mark.
9124f5 Lot of good it does me. I can't decide what theme to give this quilt. Ah, I've run out of inspiration.
91200a How about apples? Puppies? Kites!
912066 Or cotton candy! Or ballet!
912065 What about a Wonderbolt quilt?
9124f5 [laughs] See? Leave it to you three to come up with more ideas than I've had in a year! Now, that's talent.
912000 [cuckoo clock]
9124f4 Goodness. We'd better get going, or we'll miss our train home. I left you plenty of healthy food for the weekend.
9124f5 And I left you cookies. [chuckles]
912080 [gasp]
9124f4 The Cakes will stay with you tonight. Then Rarity, and Rainbow Dash after that. Remember, we're just a few stops from Ponyville if you need us.
9124f5 She knows, Holiday. See you next week, slugger.
912065 Bye, Aunt Holiday! Bye, Auntie Lofty!
912000 [door closes]
912066 Your aunts are so nice.
91200a Yeah. It's really cool they watch you while your parents are gone.
912065 I know. I just wish they lived closer. Nopony bakes like Auntie Lofty.
912000 [knocking on door]
912000 [door opens]
912065 [gasps] They're coming home today!
912066 Who?
912065 My parents!
912000 [theme song]
91205b Today, we're gonna learn about the Pegasus Weather Factory.
912000 [door creaks]
91205b Once everypony is in their seats.
912000 [door closes]
91205b The factory specializes in snow, rain, sunshine, and... [clears throat] Scootaloo? May I help you?
912065 I... just noticed your erasers needed dusting. [nervous laugh]
912000 [soft thuds]
9122ee [coughing]
91205b Why don't we hold off on the lesson until after lunch? How about show and tell? Does anypony have any—?
912065 My parents are coming home to Ponyville today!
912036 Wait. They don't live here?
912065 Nope. Their jobs are way too important for that. They travel to the farthest, most dangerous places in Equestria to study unknown plants and fierce creatures. And what they learn helps pony science and medicine. I'd go with them, but it's too dangerous. Once, my mom had to wing-wrestle a wyvern, and my dad got trapped in a chimera's cave for three moons! He still has the scars to prove it.
912036 [scoffs] You're making that up. Nopony has that kind of job.
912000 [loud thuds]
912000 [cragadile roars]
9120f3 [gasp, scream]
91205b It's a cragadile!
912000 [cragadile growling]
912000 [crash!]
9124f6 Easy there, Marshmallow! Time you were in your crate for your nap! [grunting]
912000 [cragadile growling]
9124f7 And that means now, mister!
912000 [cragadile whimpers]
912000 [clunk]
912000 [door closes]
912065 [gasps] Mom! Dad! [squeals]
91200a Still think she's makin' it all up?
912036 Nuh-uh...
912065 Everypony, meet my parents – Snap Shutter and Mane Allgood!
9124f6 Heh. Sorry to make such an entrance. Just brought back a few mates from our last adventure.
9124f7 We couldn't wait another moment to see Scootaloo! I hope we didn't interrupt anything.
912000 [hooves rattling]
91205b No, I, uh... think... class is dismissed.
912000 [students chattering]
9124f6 Crikey! You're nearly as tall as me now, Scoot!
912065 Aw, come on, Dad.
9124f7 Oh, Scootaloo. We missed you.
912065 Me, too, Mom. Did you get all my letters?
9124f7 And read them twenty times! But they're never as good as the real thing. It's so good to see you.
9124f6 I say we celebrate with ice cream sundaes. They don't have those in the jungle, that's for sure.
9124f7 Why don't you all come? Our treat.
912065 And Princess Twilight said we're such good friendship tutors, she might even let us teach a class!
9124f6 Good on ya, Scoot!
9124f7 What an honor!
912065 I can give you a tour of the school if you want. I mean, if you're staying for a while this time.
9124f6 Oh, you'll be seeing plenty of us.
912065 Really?!
9124f7 Mm-hmm. Because we've taken a new job assignment that will let all of us live together!
912065 I can't believe it! That's awesome!
91200a All right, Scootaloo!
912066 Woo-hoo!
9124f6 We never planned to be away for so long in the first place. We just kept discovering things that could help Equestria. And nopony else had the experience to finish our job.
9124f7 But with all that's happened lately – Sombra's return, the destruction of the Tree of Harmony – we decided our family should be together.
912065 This is the best day of my life.
9124f6 We'll stay in town for the weekend so you can pack your things.
912065 Wait, what?!
9124f7 We're all moving to Shire Lanka! That's where our new job is.
912065 But... my friends are in Ponyville.
9124f6 You can come back and visit 'em. Or they can take the train to us. There's one every month.
91200a But Scootaloo can't leave!
912066 We've been together our whole lives!
9124f7 It'll be a big change for everypony. But it'll be a good change. Give it time. You'll see.
912065 The only thing I see... is the end of the Cutie Mark Crusaders! [sniffling]
912000 [gavel pounding]
91200a [sniffles] I now call our last ever Cutie Mark Crusader meeting to order. First item of business... [sobbing] CRY!
912080 [crying]
912000 [pounding]
912065 You can't let the blank flanks down just 'cause I'm gone. You got to keep being CMCs without me.
912066 [sniffles] How?! There's only two of us!
912065 [sobbing] Maybe you can find a replacement for me.
912066 No, we can't! You're the only... you!
91200a [sobbing] Nothin's gonna be the same! Who's gonna ride their scooter ahead of us everywhere we go?
912066 [sobbing] Or... Or put on plays with us? Or go camping with us? Or just hang out with us?!
912065 [sobbing] Well, it's worse for me! I have to say goodbye to both of—!
912000 [door opens]
91200c Guess who just got three front-row tickets to the Wonderbolts show next week!
912080 [whine, bawling]
91200c Uh, that is not the reaction I was expecting.
912065 [sniffles] Thanks for the tickets, Rainbow Dash. But I can't go.
91200a Her parents are makin' her move super far away from Ponyville.
91200c What?! No way! Scootaloo belongs here!
912066 [sobbing] And now we'll probably never see her again! It's hopeless!
912080 [crying]
91200c Whoa, whoa, whoa. I cannot believe you're giving up so easily. You're the Cutie Mark Crusaders. Solving tough problems is what you do.
912065 [sniffles] We are pretty good at coming up with ideas.
912066 That's right. When we work together, we're unstoppable!
91200a I can't believe we didn't think of it before. It's list time, y'all! First question – why do Scootaloo's parents want to move to Shire Lanka?
912065 That's where their new job is.
912066 [gasps] What if we get them a job here instead?
91200a Yeah! They like dangerous creatures, right? We got to have some of those around here. Like, uh, Timberwolves!
912065 Dad knows all about those. And cockatrices and bugbears. They only study super rare animals.
912066 Then maybe we need to give them an animal nopony's ever heard of!
91200a Uh, then how would we hear about it?
912066 Because we're making it up! Come on!
91200c Sooooo... you want these tickets, or...?
912000 [leaves rustling]
912065 This is what I wanted to show you. The tracks of the mysterious Everfree banshee beast!
9124f7 Hmmm... They're like nothing I've ever seen.
912065 Legend says it has five claws and three wings. And it's suuuuper dangerous if you get close. If only somepony could prove it exists.
9124f6 Hmmm... Easy enough. We'll follow the spoor.
912065 [panicked whimpering] I think I heard something this way.
912000 [leaves rustling]
912000 [camera clicks]
912081 [grunting]
91200a So the plan is we let 'em get a picture, then we hide again. Right?
912066 [straining]
912000 [twig snaps]
912000 [camera clicks]
912066 Now the plan is... run!
912081 [panting]
912000 [snap!]
912081 Aah! Oof!
912065 [nervous laugh] Guess you solved the mystery.
9124f7 We'd better get back. There's a lot to get ready before the house goes up for sale tomorrow.
912065 [whines]
912066 Don't worry, Scootaloo. We have a new plan to keep you in Ponyville.
91200a We just got to show your parents we're a set of three. Then they'll have to let you stay here with us.
912000 [camera clicks]
9124f6 Scoot, are these yours?
912065 Yeah. Thanks, Dad. We're sending them to the Pony Book of Records.
912066 We're the only three ponies in Equestria with the same cutie mark.
91200a The chances of that are so rare. It means we belong together forever.
9124f6 Yeah, but you don't have the same cutie mark.
91200a [short laugh] Sure we do. Look!
9124f6 Well, this part is the same. But the picture inside each of these is different. I think it means you'll stay best friends no matter where you go, and that's really special.
912065 But... we... [sighs] How do you argue with that?
912065 [sighs]
912000 [door opens]
91200a All right, y'all. Time to take things up a notch.
912065 With prune juice?
91200a It's a potion I mixed up from Zecora's book. Prune is only one of the ingredients.
912066 What's it do?
91200a [reading] "On this potion, please depend. Any separation, mend. Friends together 'til the end." We just got to dab a little on our hooves. Sounds perfect, right?
912065 Better than perfect!
912000 [drops splash]
912066 Is something supposed to happen?
912000 [magic sounds]
912000 [snap!]
912066 Is this the something that's supposed to happen?!
91200a The book didn't really say.
912080 Whoa... W-Whoa... Whoa! [grunt]
912065 Thanks for trying, Apple Bloom. But I might as well face it. I'm gonna have to leave Ponyville.
91200a Don't give up, Scootaloo. This just gave me an even better idea how to keep you here. Come on!
912080 Whoa! [grunt]
912066 Maybe we'd better see Zecora about fixing this first.
912065 We're running out of time.
912000 [chains jangling]
912065 This has to work!
912000 [door opens]
9124f7 Scootaloo, I know you're having fun with your friends, but we need to get all our things to the station.
9124f6 We can't miss tomorrow's train. It's the only one for a month.
912065 Then you'll just have to go without me! I'm staying with the CMCs!
912066 We're chained to this post!
91200a And nothin' and nopony is gonna move us! No matter... what.
9124f6 We just sold the house, Scoot. I know this is hard to accept, but just—
912065 It's more than hard! It's not fair! You're making me pick between my family and my friends!
9124f7 Oh, Scootaloo. Moving away won't stop you three from caring about each other. Why don't you sleep over with Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom tonight? It'll give you a chance to say a real goodbye.
912065 But I don't want to say goodbye! You're changing my whole life without even asking how I feel! [crying]
91200a [panting] Scootaloo!
912066 Where are you going?
912065 To stay with my aunts. [tearing up] You heard my parents. There isn't another train to Shire Lanka for a month. If I'm not on it, they'll have to go without me.
91200a Then we're comin' with ya!
912065 Are you sure? I don't want to get you in trouble.
912066 Rarity won't be mad.
91200a Applejack neither. I bet she'd do the same thing for her friends.
912065 You're the best, you know that?
91200a We're the best.
912066 Together!
912000 [train whistle blows]
912000 [brakes hiss]
912000 [train chugging]
912000 [knocking on door]
912000 [door opens]
9124f4 [gasps] Scootaloo! What a nice surprise.
9124f5 And I've got a surprise for you! You three inspired me to finish my quilt. See? It's Cutie Mark Crusader-themed!
9124f4 We love hearing stories about all the ponies you've helped. So Lofty decided to celebrate the special job you three do.
912065 [sighs]
9124f5 It's... still a work-in-progress.
912065 It's not your quilt we're sad about, Auntie Lofty. Mom and Dad are back. And they're making me move to Shire Lanka with them!
9124f4 Snap and Mane are back? They didn't tell me that.
912065 Oh. I think the mailpony delivered your letter to my house. I love my family, but I love being with my friends, too. I don't want to have to choose.
9124f5 Well, then why don't your parents just stay in Ponyville?
912065 Their job is too important.
91200a That's it!
912066 Is this another potion idea?
91200a No. Scootaloo's parents are the only ponies in Equestria that can do what they do, right?
912065 Right...
91200a Well, so are we! Our cutie marks prove it!
912066 Yeah... Our job is to help other ponies find their purpose!
912065 And nopony else can do that! So if my parents split us up, it'd be just as bad as them quitting their jobs!
912080 Woo-hoo! [laughing]
91200a Now, how do we explain that to 'em?
9124f4 Oh, you don't have to explain it.
9124f5 They will.
9124f7 Feeling better, Scootaloo?
912065 A little. I just want to show you something before we go.
9124f6 All right, but let's make it swift. That train won't wait.
9124f6 Sweet Celestia's slippers!
9124f7 What is all this?
91200c It's Cutie Mark Crusader Appreciation Day! But we couldn't start without all of them here.
91200f CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs! CMCs!
912010 These three ponies share a rare ability to help others find their true purpose. It's a job only they can do, and only together.
9124f7 That sounds familiar.
912010 In honor of all they have done and continue to do for the ponies of this town, I would like to present the Cutie Mark Crusaders with a three-handled Key to the City!
91200f [cheering]
912000 [zooming]
9124f6 A full Wonderbolt salute!
9124f4 Oh, I'm not sure you know just how important Scootaloo and her friends are, little brother.
9124f5 But you're about to find out.
912428 The CMCs used their free time to set up a camp to help us blank flanks find our cutie marks. The Cutie Mark Crusaders see the best in everypony, even when that pony can't see it in themselves.
9124f6 Well, I'll be a three-tailed bandicoot. I had no idea how important Scoot's club was.
91200c Oh, it's way more than just a club. The CMCs have made a difference for everypony here.
91246c And not just ponies. They help everycreature.
9124f4 Whether it's encouraging others to discover their special talent...
912000 [hooves tapping]
9124f5 ...or inspiring them to do what's in their heart...
9124f4 ...these three offer the town something no other pony can.
912000 [train whistle blows]
91200c No way! After all that, you're still gonna make her leave?!
9124f7 We just want what's best for Scootaloo. And until now, we thought we knew what that was.
9124f6 [sighs] Turns out you're just like us, Scoot. You have an important job that only you can do. You love it, and it helps all of Equestria.
9124f7 Sometimes that means missing out on other things you love, like watching our daughter grow into a pony we're very proud of.
9124f6 Which is a long way to say... Scoot, if you want to stay, we understand.
912065 [gasps] Really?! [tearing up] Thanks, Dad! Thanks, Mom!
9124f7 Oh, sweetie, I'm just sorry we didn't realize it sooner.
9124f6 Our work is our life's purpose. We could never quit. So there's no way we can ask you to do the same.
9124f5 Maybe you should've thought of that before you sold the house.
9124f4 Lofty, don't tease my brother. We already have a solution worked out.
9124f5 Since the CMCs make Ponyville such a nice place, we've decided to move here.
9124f4 You can live with us, Scootaloo. If you'd like.
912065 That would be amazing! Will you... still come and visit?
9124f7 Of course!
9124f6 Rabid bugbears couldn't keep us away.
912081 You get to stay here! You get to stay here! You get to stay here! [laugh]
91200a Uh... you are stayin' here, right?
912065 Are you kidding? CMCs forever!
912080 [cheer]
91200f [cheering]
912000 [credits]
913000 [stomping]
913003 Remind me how this happened again!
913000 [crunch]
913008 And why there's a giant turtle eatin' my family's entire summer crop!
91300e Oh, dear. Mr Tortoise-Snap said he was hungry. But he promised me he would only take a few small bites.
91300c I don't think that thing knows what "small" is.
9134f8 [gulps]
913000 [stomping]
913005 Aah!
91300d Spikey-Wikey!
913005 Whoa!
9134f8 [chomps]
913003 Applejack and Pinkie, you distract him! Rainbow Dash, Rarity, and Fluttershy, let's save Spike!
913008 [grunting]
913000 [whirring]
9134f8 [low growl]
913000 [snap!]
91300e Mr Tortoise-Snap, I'm only asking nicely once! Let my friend go!
9134f8 [low growl]
913005 Whoa! Whoa!
913003 And now, a simple teleportation spell should—
913019 Halt, interloper!
91301a Stay back, friends! My sister and I will take care of the beast!
913000 [magic zaps]
91300c All the times we've actually needed their help, and they show up for this?
913000 [whooshing]
913000 [teleportation zap]
913003 That's just what I was about to do!
91301a [laughs] Goodness, sister! That was fun!
913019 No need to thank us. To be honest, we've recently realized we like being part of the action.
91301a Experiencing life instead of just dreaming about it.
913019 And making a difference outside the throne room.
913268 [laughing]
913008 Y'all think they're gonna be doin' this a lot?
913000 [theme song]
913000 [crunch]
913000 [splash]
91300e Oh, my. We'd better ask somepony to fix that hole. It seems very dangerous.
91301a Which is why we're here!
913000 [whoosh]
913000 [thud]
913000 [ponies cheering]
91300c [growls] I can't read this thing. How am I supposed to lead a Filly Guides hike if the map makes us more lost?
913019 Did somepony say "lost"?
91301a Not for long! [laughs]
913000 [zap!]
913007 [slurps]
91302a Oh, now, this is just terrible! Miss Cheerilee ordered cupcakes for school today, and I forgot to make the order!
913007 Ah, no biggie. We could—
913000 [crash!]
913019 Students going hungry? Not on our watch!
91301a Let us bake, sister!
913007 [gasps]
913000 [splattering]
913008 And then they carried Granny Smith across the street. There wasn't even any traffic!
91300e It's not that we don't appreciate their help.
91300d But suddenly, Celestia and Luna seem to think we can't do anything on our own.
91300c How are we supposed to learn to be rulers of Equestria with them fixing every teensy problem for us?
913003 Maybe the princesses changed their minds. Maybe they don't think we're up to the responsibility of protecting Equestria after all!
913005 Or maybe this week's just a one-time thing that'll never happen again.
913000 [doors open]
913019 Ah! A strategy meeting! What is the danger this time? A rampaging beast? Evil spell? Friendship problem?
91301a We're ready to do whatever we can.
913003 Great. But is something wrong? It's just... You've been helping us an awful lot, and we know you have way more important ruler-y things to do, so...
91301a We've spent more than enough time in the throne room. Real life is happening out here.
913003 Wait. That's what this is about? You're sick of being princesses?
913019 Not exactly. Battling the Everfree Forest alongside Star Swirl made us realize what we've missed out on. So, instead of spending the day ruling...
91301a ...and the night patrolling dreams...
913019 ...we wanted a chance to do the things you do. Save the day! Adventure with friends! Shampoo anteaters.
913005 I'm pretty sure Fluttershy's the only pony that does that.
91300c Well, there are waaaay more fun things to do than follow us around.
913007 Ooh! You should make a list of all the stuff you never tried but always wanted to! There's a lotta little things out there to do!
913019 What an intriguing idea. Only... it's much harder to justify a vacation from the castle when it's not an emergency we're responding to.
913003 Don't worry. We'll cover your palace duties. It'll be a good chance for us to practice for when you retire.
91301a Well, if you're sure you don't mind the extra effort.
913003 [scoffs]
913019 Thank you, Twilight! What a relief to know the Royal Swanifying Ceremony is in good hooves. [laughs]
913008 The what now?
913019 "Fun Not Yet Had". [squeals] I can't wait to start planning our time off!
91301a The chance to do whatever we want! And you know what that means!
913019 Princess Celestia:
913019 Adventure!
91301a Princess Luna:
91301a Relaxation!
91301a Well, it's just that I... I spend each night in everypony's intense dreams. So I could use some real-world downtime.
913019 [sighs] I understand. But for me, every day is real-world. Meetings and decrees and meetings about decrees and decrees about the meetings... I crave excitement!
91301a Uh, I'm not sure how we can both be happy. Unless...
913019 [gasps] We take turns doing what we like!
913268 Sister trip!
91301a And I have the perfect accessories for us to wear! Wait right here!
913000 [teleportation zap]
913000 [teleportation zap]
913019 Oh. [nervous laugh] We'll be... twin-sies.
91301a [giggling] Just like regular pony tourists. I knew you'd love it.
913019 I have a few things for us, too.
913000 [thud]
913019 Sunglasses, bug spray, ice boots, hoof sanitizer, and travel snacks!
91301a [slurps, chews, coughs]
913019 You have to add water. What do you think?
91301a It's perfect, sister.
913019 And here are instructions of how to prepare for the Royal Swanifying.
913003 If it's written down, I'm sure we can handle it. Have fun!
91301a One more thing. We're leaving you in charge of raising the sun and moon while we're gone.
913049 [gasp]
913003 [nervous laugh]
913019 We have put a small part of our power in this amulet. You can activate it with your magic at any time. Preferably dawn and dusk.
913007 Ooh! That's not a terrifying level of responsibility or anything!
913003 We won't let you down, princesses. [to Spike] Please tell me that scroll says what the the Royal Swanifying is.
913005 Apparently it's a celebration of all the swans in the royal lake. We round them up, parade them through the streets, and finish with a party in the castle.
913000 [swan squawks]
91300c One question. Why?!
913003 It doesn't matter. This is our chance to show Celestia and Luna we'll do whatever the job requires. If they can take care of all this themselves, then I know we can. Together.
91300e Um... hmm.
91300d Ah. Jolly good.
913005 You're definitely not reading the same scroll I am.
913019 Remember, sister. From now on, we are regular, carefree ponies!
913000 [excited chattering]
913000 [camera clicks]
91301a We're leaving the princess life behind, and we're not even going to fly!
913019 Of course. [laughs] How new and different. It's just like Pinkie Pie said.
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a There's a lotta little things you gotta try
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 Just a pack of punchy plunges other ponies all take
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a That have princess-pony-passed us right by
913000 [Both]
913000 Nopony knows you like your little sister
913000 Nopony is a better confidante
913000 Nopony is truer than the one you are
913000 Nopony else here I could want
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 You can't saunter on a sojourn hid behind castle walls
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a You can't throw a throne down on the beach
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 So we're gonna be absconding
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a To a little vagabonding
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 And this bucket list is gonna be a peach
913000 [Both]
913000 Nopony knows you like your older sister
913000 Nopony is a better confidante
913000 Nopony is truer than the one you are
913000 Nopony else here I could want
913000 There's a lotta little things you gotta try in this world
913000 There's a lotta little things you gotta see
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a But just reading by a river and resting our hooves
91301a Would practically be perfect for me
913000 [Both]
913000 Nopony knows you like your sister
913000 Nopony is a better confidante
913000 Nopony is truer than the one you are
913000 Nopony else here I could want
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 You can't venture on adventures if you're taking a nap
913019 You can't check things off your checklist while you sleep
913019 So let's take another hill
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a Sometimes you can be a pill
91301a And why's the way ahead always so steep?
913000 [doors open]
913122 Princesses, we are here to... Oh.
913008 Uh, we're fillin' in for Their Majesties. What can we help y'all with?
913122 I say. How irregular. Well then. We offer our assistance as heads of the Royal Swanifying Committee.
91300d Ah, what a relief.
913003 Thank you, but we have it all covered.
913122 Reeeeeally? Well, good luck with that.
913003 If we ask for help, it's just like admitting we're not as good at the job as Luna and Celestia are. Besides, how hard can throwing a swan party be?
913007 Yeah! All we have left to do is polish the armor, bubble the punch, glitter the carpet, puff the pastry, float the floats, and carpet every road in Canterlot! Should I keep reading?
913003 [nervous laugh]
91301a Uh, Celestia? Since we're both a little tired, m-maybe the first thing we do shouldn't be too wild.
913019 Exactly what I was thinking.
913019 ziiiiip liiiiiiiiiine!
913019 Now, every time we have tea, we can remember this magical day!
91301a Well, I'm glad you enjoyed yourself. But now, we're going to do something I've always wanted to do but never could because of my night shift.
913019 Is it another zip line?
91301a No.
91301a It's the post office!
913019 It is indeed.
91301a Just think! All the mail in Ponyville goes through here! Isn't that amazing?!
913000 [thump]
91301a One stamp, please!
913000 [clattering]
91301a [licks] Wait for it...
913000 [watch ticking]
913000 [door opens]
913019 You didn't need a stamp if you were just going to give this to me.
91301a Yes, but I didn't give it to you. A mailpony took it from me, searched to find who it was meant for, and gave it to you! It's about the process!
913019 [echoing] Did you know that nopony has ever explored the bottom of these caverns?
913000 [roaring]
913000 [rocks crunching]
91301a [flatly] I wonder why.
91301a I have always wanted to try this!
913000 [technopop]
91301a Isn't this wonderful, sister?
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 There's a lotta little things you gotta do in this world
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a There's a lotta little things you ought to view
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 And our little lotta list may be a little bit long
91301a [Princess Luna]
913000 [sighs] And might take a lotta bother to do
913000 [Both]
913000 But I'm sure it gets better later on
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 And after darkest night's a new dawn
91301a [Princess Luna]
91301a It's my turn to do the choosing
913019 [Princess Celestia]
913019 After river rapid cruising
913000 [Both]
913000 This adventure isn't too fun to be on
913000 [inflating sounds]
913000 [doors open]
913122 Princess Twilight! It has come to our attention that you don't intend to serve watercress at the Royal Swanifying Ceremony.
913003 There's not enough in the castle kitchens to—
913122 Don't tell me. Tell him.
913000 [swan squawks]
913122 And you must do something about the garbage piling up outside. The street sweepers are on strike, and the royal carpeters can't do their jobs.
913008 Did you even know there were royal street carpeters?
913122 Oh, dear. I do hope those aren't the final decorations for the gala.
91300d How rude.
913003 Thank you for your constructive criticism. But we really don't have time to chat, so...
913000 [doors close]
913019 [chewing, gulps] Well, I hope you're enjoying yourself on your super-relaxing picnic, sister.
91301a I would be if you hadn't made us hike through a million prickle bushes! [groans]
913019 Well, they hurt less than that horrible howling you dragged us to.
91301a That was Ponygliacci, and it's an opera! And you made us leave early, even though it was still my turn.
913019 Oh, just face it, Luna. You are never happy!
91301a Because you don't want me to be happy. I always have to do things your way. I bet you wish I'd never come back so you could still rule day and night!
913019 You think I like that kind of pressure?! Being responsible for every little thing in Equestria and you?! What I'd like is a [booming] sister I can depend on!
91301a [booming] You mean boss around!
913019 [booming] Calm down, Luna!
91301a No! And don't you dare use your Canterlot Voice on me! I think this adventure would be better if I did it by myself!
913019 Fine! I just remembered something I forgot I always wanted to do. Be alone!
91301a [tearing up] Guess we have the same thing on both of our lists then.
913008 Pinkie! You got those appetizers yet?!
913007 Still mashing the guacamole!
913005 [yelping]
91300d So we're just going to have to do with sequins!
91300e Um, sorry for the bad news, but the courtyard is full of swans waiting to get in!
913000 [swans squawking]
91300c And we're nowhere near ready!
913003 How does Celestia and Luna rule a kingdom and get all this done by themselves every year?!
913122 [laughs] Oh, how droll.
913005 Uh, what's the funny part exactly?
913122 The princesses never do all the ceremony planning by themselves.
913003 They don't?
913122 Oh, goodness, no. That's what the gala planning committees are for. Nopony could handle all this. [sips] Are those... sequins?
91300d Still rude.
913003 Ooh! New plan, everypony! We're going to delegate!
91300c [to Upper Crust] You! You're on food duty!
91300d [to Jet Set] I need gemstones! And purple satin!
91300e [to Fleur de Lis] Tell the ponies at the gates there's a slight delay on the gala! Oh, um, if it's not too much trouble, I mean.
913008 Uh... Now, who can we get to clean up all this garbage?
913000 [stomping]
913007 I'm delegating!
913003 So this is how you rule Equestria!
91301a [slurping, sighs] Things are so much more relaxing without my bossy sister.
913000 [ponies laughing]
913019 Who needs a gloomy sister moping around all the time anyway? [whinnies]
91301a [groans]
91314d Honestly, princess, didn't you wear any sunblock?
91301a That's a thing? [sighs] Celestia would've warned me. If she were here.
913019 Now, was it two left turns and a right, or two right turns and a left?
913000 [whoosh!]
913019 Luna always handled directions.
913000 [twig snaps]
913000 [chicken clucks]
913019 [shakily] And scared away the chickens!
913019 Oh! Heh. I thought climbing Mount Filly-mane-jaro was on my list.
91301a I'm not copying you! I just wanted to watch the sunrise.
913019 Ah. I'm, uh, here for the moonset.
913000 [beat]
913019 So, uh, how did the rest of your day go?
91301a Oh, amazing! Yeah. Uh, f-fantastic. Best ever, really.
913019 Yeah. Me... too. Mmm.
91301a You... You can walk with me. You know, i-if you want, I mean.
913019 Oh, well... [scoffs] Since we're going the same way. [laughs]
91301a This is so beautiful. It must be amazing in the sunlight.
913019 The night's pretty special, too.
913268 Lucky star!
91301a You taught me to look for those when I was a filly.
913019 [laughs] Hope I wasn't too bossy doing it.
91301a You know, being with your sister all the time is hard, but being without her? It's even harder.
913019 I do know. [sighs] And I wouldn't trade you for any of the adventures on my list.
91301a Not even your zip line?
913000 [poof!]
913019 Not even my zip line.
91301a I'm sorry I said those things before. Sometimes it's just tough being the little sister.
913019 It's not always easy being the big sister either. I'm sorry, too.
91301a [gasps] The sun and the moon together? At the same time?
913019 Now, where have I seen that before?
913268 [laugh]
913000 [long pause]
913019 You think maybe Twilight's having trouble with the amulet?
91301a We should probably go help her.
913005 Okay, okay! I think I got it! Sunburst says we just need to reset the amulet with this! Turn the screw on the back—
913000 [cranking]
913000 [sproing!]
913005 ...and no more than one half turn.
913003 [whimpers] Does anypony have some tape?!
913000 [credits]
914000 [whoosh!]
91400c I thought Pinkie Pie said to get here right away.
914008 She sure had a burr in her britches about somethin'.
914005 So where is she?
914007 [scoffs] Yeah. What is taking her so long? [giggles] Just kidding. You guys really need to look behind you once in a while.
914003 Uh, Pinkie? You said you had something important to tell us.
914007 Not telling so much as showing. In fact, what you're about to see may shake the very foundations of your perception for all time!
91400e Um... a cupcake?
914007 Yes! But wait, there's more!
914000 [click]
914000 [squeak!]
914007 It's an invitation to visit the Cheese Sandwich Amusement Factory!
914005 Cheese Sandwich opened a factory?
914008 Heh. What do they make there? Rubber chickens?
914007 That's ridiculous! They make way more there than just rubber chickens! [giggles]
91400d Gosh, Cheese hardly seems the factory type. I just assumed he'd continue to wander Equestria throwing parties. Still, you must be excited to see him.
914007 I am! I can't wait to tour his factory, catch up, have him tell me my life's purpose, swap gag tips—
914008 Whoa-whoa-whoa. What did you say?
914007 Uh, catch up? I mean, it has been a while.
914003 I think Applejack's asking about the part about Cheese Sandwich and your life's purpose.
914007 Oh, that. Yeah. It's just... All of you have found your thing. You're gonna rule all of Equestria, Rainbow Dash is a Wonderbolt, Fluttershy has her animal sanctuary, Rarity has her boutiques, Applejack has the hat... And the farm! So that's like... two things! I don't even have one. [sighs, chomps] When I first got Cheese's invite, I was a little jealous. It felt like even he was moving on to bigger and better things. And everypony was leaving me behind. But then I realized Cheese Sandwich is a party pony just like me. If he figured out his purpose, he can help me figure out mine.
914003 I think talking to Cheese Sandwich is a great idea. But the only pony who can really find your life's purpose is you.
914007 I know, silly. That's why I'm going to visit Cheese Sandwich's factory so I can ask him to help me. [chomps]
914005 Uh, Pinkie? Are you sure this is edible?
914007 I am not! [chomps]
914000 [theme song]
914000 [bouncing]
914007 Yup! Anypony with a smile like that is exactly the kind of pony I want helping me!
914000 [bouncing]
914007 Oh, hey, guys! Pardon me? Just gonna... squeeze by? [straining]
9144f9 Can we help you?
914007 You sure can! I'm here to see Cheese Sandwich!
9144fa Cheese Sandwich doesn't "see" anypony.
9144f9 This factory's shut tight. Nopony ever comes out, and nopony ever goes in. Including you. So move along.
914007 Aw, that's a shame. To think I came all this way because of this personal invitation from Cheese Sandwich himself.
9144fa You... You have an invitation?
9144f9 Well, why didn't you say so?
914000 [alarm]
914000 [clang!]
9144fa Next time, I get to push the button.
914007 Ooh! Desolate-y! Hello? Anypony there?
914000 [doors open]
914007 [yelps] Cheese! I'm so happy to see you! [strains]
914000 [stretch]
914000 [whip!]
9144fb Hmm. This should have gotten a big laugh. I wonder if we need to add more carpet rolls. I suppose it could be the mask. Let's try taking the nostril flare down ten percent. Thoughts?
914007 I have a thought. Who are you?
9144fb So sorry. Sans Smirk, vice-president of amusement integration. Mr Sandwich is very excited you're here. If you'll just follow me, it's a short trip through the factory to Cheese's office.
914007 Wow! A whole factory dedicated to gags! Ooh! I bet this is the funnest place ever!
914000 [doors open]
914007 Huh.
914000 [industrial sounds]
914000 [conveyor belt whirring]
914007 Maybe the fun is behind all this boring-looking factory stuff.
914000 [thud]
914000 [pop!]
914000 [thunk!]
9144fb The fun is the factory stuff. We take a fairly serious approach to comedy here. Observe. [stilted] Oh, look. A pretty flower. [sniffs]
914000 [squirt]
914007 The squirting flower's a classic. Ohhh! What if the flower was part of a shirt, but the flower didn't squirt – the shirt did?!
9144fb That is literally the funniest thing I've ever heard.
914007 Oh, [giggles] come on. That's just off the top of my head. You probably get, like, seventeen thousand ideas like that from Cheese every minute.
9144fb We'd have to use a series of interconnected tubes in the fabric. What do you think of this?
914000 [flatulence]
914007 I think it's a whoopee cushion.
9144fb Yes...?
914007 But what if you made the embarrassing sound come from somepony else?!
9144fb I sit on it, but the sound comes from you... We could call it the "ventriloquoopee cushion".
914000 [factory ponies agreeing]
914007 So... which way is Cheese's office again?
9144fb Right. Of course. It's been quite a while since we've had the opportunity to work with true comic inspiration like this.
914007 What about Cheese?
9144fb Oh! One more thing. Our super-slip banana peel. Still in development, but we think it's pretty special.
914000 [splattering sounds]
914000 [factory ponies yelping]
9144fb So? Too slippery?
914007 Ohhh-ho-ho. What if, instead of slipping, you were sticking? One step on this banana peel, and you can't get it off! [giggles] That's funny!
9144fb Wow. Just... wow. You're exactly the pony Cheese Sandwich needs to see.
914007 Great! Because he's exactly the pony I need to see!
914000 [door opens]
914007 Uh... hello?
914224 [grimly] Pinkie, I'm... I'm glad you came.
914007 Of course I did. Your factory's... big. It really seems like you found your purpose. Which is perfect, since I came here for help.
914224 That is perfect. I knew I could count on you to help me.
914007 Well, that's triple-perfect, because... uh, wait. Why do you need my help?
914224 Because, Pinkie, I... [claps]
914000 [ka-chunk]
914224 ...I completely lost my laugh!
914007 [gasps]
914007 You lost your laugh? Is that some kind of joke? Because it's not a funny one.
914224 It's not a joke. And even if it was, I... I wouldn't be able to laugh at it.
914007 Riiiiight... Why don't we continue this discussion over some delicious canned peanut brittle, hmm? [laughs]
914000 [sproing]
914007 Wow. You did lose your laugh. That's horrible!
9144fb Sorry to interrupt, but it occurs to me that a seven percent tighter wind on the snake springs would yield a twelve percent increase in giggle output.
914224 This is why we're a team. Sans here has always been able to eke every last laugh out of my gags. W-Which is a help, since I haven't come up with any good ones in a while.
914007 Wait. So you can tell if a gag is funny is not – you just can't laugh at it?
914224 [tearing up] Yes! And it's torture!
914007 How did this happen?
914224 I don't know. Back when I was a party pony, I... I laughed at everything.
914224 [voiceover] I spread my party cheer wherever it was needed. I even started making individual, one-of-a-kind novelty gags for each and every one of my parties.
914000 [whack! whack! whack!]
914000 [foals laughing]
914224 [laughing]
914224 [voiceover] Soon, it seemed like everypony in Equestria wanted one.
914000 [excited sounds]
914000 [buzzing]
914224 [laughs]
914224 [voiceover] It was more work than my hooves could handle, but I didn't want to disappoint all those smiling faces.
914000 [door opens]
914224 [voiceover] Luckily, Sans Smirk came to me with the idea for a factory. A gag factory. I could finally keep up with demand and make everypony happy. Soon we were sending gags all over Equestria.
914000 [conveyor belt whirs]
914000 [flatulence]
914000 [conveyor belt whirs]
914000 [crank]
914000 [ribbit!]
914000 [conveyor belt whirs]
914000 [squirt]
914224 [voiceover] But then, one day, my laugh was just... gone.
914224 I haven't left the factory since. I-I don't want anypony to see me like this. I-I mean, look at me! Boneless 2 doesn't even recognize me anymore!
914000 [chair creaks]
914224 So, can you help me, Pinkie? W-What do you think?
914007 I think I've got two words for you. Knock... knock.
914224 Who's there?
914007 Boo.
914224 Boo who?
914007 Don't cry, because I'm gonna get you your laugh back!
914007 Let's start with something small. Excuse me, Mr Smirk. But is there something in my... eye?!
914000 [rattling]
9144fb Top notch eye-googling, Ms. Pie.
914224 [groans]
914007 Why, thanks, Sans, ol' pal. Put her there!
914000 [buzzing]
9144fb [groaning]
914000 [sizzle]
914007 Oh. Sorry about that. Let me make it up to you. How about some... pie?
914000 [splat!]
9144fb Googly eye to hoof buzzer to pie-face pratfall. Mwah! Masterful.
914224 Meh.
914007 Come on! Those classic bits put Rainbow Dash's funny bone in a cast for a week!
914224 Don't blame yourself, Pinkie. Whatever I got, I got it bad.
914007 Hmmm... Maybe we need to start even smaller.
914007 You can't run before you can walk, and you can't laugh before you can smile. And your smiler's all out of whack. Now let's see what we're working with. Give me your biggest, bestest smile!
914224 [straining] Am I doing it? Am I smiling? I feel like I'm smiling.
914007 Almost... [laughing nervously] Maybe I just need to spot you for a rep or two. [straining] Okay! You got this! It's all you! Ready?
914224 Anything?
914007 Awww...
914224 Guh.
914007 I'm not giving up on you yet, Cheese. I know there's something somewhere that'll make you laugh. I just have to figure out where to look.
9144fb I would like to take this opportunity to point out that we are in a gag factory.
914000 [door opens]
9144fb This is where the magic happens – research and development. It's where we figure out the science of funny.
914007 How do you science funny?
9144fb Of course there's no one-size-fits-all joke. No grand unified gag theory. But if we figure out the funny of one gag, we can combine it with the funny of another gag and make a third funnier gag.
914000 [sproing]
914000 [splat]
914007 I... guess that makes sense. "Rule of threes". Hmmm. One, two, three. Yup. That math checks out. Hmmm. At this point, I'm willing to give anything a try.
914000 [montage music]
914000 [awestruck sounds]
914000 [door closes]
914000 [clang!]
914000 [splash!]
914000 ["uh-uh", "nope", etc.]
914000 [squirt]
914000 [pop-pop-pop]
914007 [groans] I don't understand! We've tried everything! Stand-up, classic gag, physical humor, prop comedy, vaudeville, surrealist alt-scene character pieces – nothing's worked!
9144fb It seems we've exhausted every avenue that even the science of comedy can provide.
914224 That's it then.
914007 What do you mean?
914224 [sighs] I appreciate everything you've done, Pinkie, but if you can't make me laugh, nopony can.
9144fb But, sir, you can't just surrender.
914224 It doesn't look like I have a choice. I need to figure out how to live without a laugh. I know you tried your best, but it's time you went home.
914000 [doors open]
914007 [gasps]
9144fb I, too, am horrified.
914007 So that's it? You're all just giving up?
9144fb I'm afraid Mr Sandwich is right. You are the funniest pony in Equestria. And if you can't bring back his laugh, it is surely gone forever.
914007 But... Cheese was just as funny as me. I-I can't believe that's all gone.
914000 [doors open]
9144fb None of us can. I shudder to think what'll become of the factory.
914007 You're not gonna close down, are you? I thought this place was Cheese's life's purpose!
9144fb It certainly was mine. But if Mr Sandwich has finally given up, there's only so long we can retool his old ideas before we run out of gags to produce. I don't suppose... you'd consider working here? Your fresh take on our classic gags rivals Mr Sandwich in his prime.
914007 I need to find my life's purpose, but I don't think that's it. I'm a party pony! I need to make ponies happy in real-time!
9144fb Ah, yes. In our early days, nothing brought Mr Sandwich more pleasure than seeing the laughter his gags brought to ponies firsthoof.
914007 Guess it's back to the drawing board.
9144fb Well, there will always be a place for you here if you change your mind.
914007 Hold on. What did you just say?
9144fb There'll always be a place for you here?
914007 No-no-no-no. Before that.
9144fb Back to the drawing board.
914007 [groans] That was me!
9144fb Nothing brought Mr Sandwich more pleasure than seeing the laughter his gags brought to ponies firsthoof?
914007 Yes! That! We've been going about this all wrong! We don't need to make Cheese laugh. He needs to make us laugh!
914000 [zip!]
914000 [door opens]
914007 Cheese! I figured it out! I know why you can't laugh!
914224 What? Why?
914007 You started this factory because you didn't want to disappoint smiling faces. But in here, you can't see any.
9144fb [panting] It does make a certain sense, sir. Spreading laughter has always brought you joy.
914224 But spreading laughter is what this factory does.
914007 Except you don't see it. You're a party pony like me. You need to make ponies smile in-person! Here. Just try it.
914224 Okay... um... [clears throat] Why did Boneless 2 cross the road? To prove to Boneless 1 he wasn't a chicken.
9144fb Very funny, sir. Excellent joke. Oh! I mean... [forced laughter]
914007 Really?
9144fb Sorry. Not much of a laugher.
914007 Here. Try me. I promise I'll laugh.
914224 Pinkie, you laugh at everything. I appreciate what you're doing, but I think it's a "cost lause". [stutters] A lost cause.
9144fc [snickers]
914224 What... was... that?!
9144fc Um, I'm sorry. When you swapped the letters of those words, it was just a bit...
914224 Funny?
9144fc Uh-huh.
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 So you're saying it's a mix-up
914224 Of the sounds that I just made
914224 That coaxed the snicker from your throat
914224 In a delicate cascade?
914224 If I did it one more time
914224 If I reproduced that feat
914224 Mixed up some letters here and there
914224 You'd "lelly-baugh" tout de suite?
914000 [ponies laughing]
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 Then that's all I need to do
914224 That's who I need to be
914224 I thought I needed laughter
914224 But it has to come from me
914224 Squirting flowers and knobby knees
914224 Rubber chickens my expertise
914224 If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese
914000 [ponies laughing]
914007 Yeah!
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 I suppose now I should amp things up
914224 To get the thing I'm after
914224 Move whole syll-AB-les around
914224 And change em-PHA-sis to get laughter
914224 Can't stop now, I'm on a roll
914224 I've almost got it back
914224 Bright folks like you aren't subject to
914224 My play-on-words attack!
914224 With something else, I'll have to play
914224 To get me where I'm going
914007 Whatcha gonna do?
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914000 [falsetto] Some Commedia dell'arte
914000 To get the laughter flowing
914000 And it's what I need to do
914000 It's who I need to be
914000 I thought I needed laughter
914000 But it has to come from me
914000 Follow right behind, if you please
914000 Walk this way and I guarantee
914000 If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese
914000 Accordion solo!
914007 Shred it, Cheese!
914000 [accordion playing]
914224 Whoo! [laughing and whooping]
914224 And it's what I need to do
914224 It's who I need to be
914224 I thought I needed laughter
914224 But it has to come from me
914224 Whoopee cushions and Dungarees
914224 I know jokes like my A-B-C's
914224 If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese
914000 [ponies laughing]
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 And now my biggest test
914224 The hardest fish to fry
914007 [Pinkie Pie]
914007 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 A mind so analytical
914224 A sense of humor dry
914007 [Pinkie Pie]
914007 So dry!
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 To make you laugh would prove to me
914224 That this experiment's done
914007 [Pinkie Pie]
914007 Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 Something ridiculous and not too smart
914224 Something like a pun
914224 Hey, Sans! How did the laughing bird's eggs hatch? They cracked up!
914000 [rimshot]
9144fb Sir... that is so... ridiculous! [laughs]
914224 [Cheese Sandwich]
914224 Then that's all I need to do
914224 That's all I need to see
914224 I thought I needed laughter
914224 But it had to come from me
91404d [All]
91404d Squirting flowers and knobby knees
91404d Rubber chickens and Dungarees
91404d If you want laughter, then stick with Cheese!
914000 [factory ponies laughing]
9144fb It's so good to have you back, sir. Finally we can get the factory back to how things used to be.
914224 Sans, my good pony, I don't think I could run this factory anymore. But you can!
9144fb Without you? I-I don't understand.
914224 Pinkie was right. This is what I need.
914000 [factory ponies laughing]
914224 I just can't have funny ideas. I need to wander the land and see ponies laughing at them. You can run the factory, but I need to [operatically] liiiiiive! And don't think I've forgotten about you, little buddy.
914000 [chair creaks]
914224 I knew you'd be onboard. Don't worry. Out in Equestria, I'll have more great ideas for gags, and I'll send them all to you.
9144fb Sir, are you sure this is what you want to do?
914224 Of course. It's my life's purpose!
914007 Hey! That's what I came here looking for!
914224 You did? Well, come on! Let's figure it out!
914000 [factory ponies laughing]
914007 Actually, I think I'm good.
914007 ...And then I said goodbye, and then I came here! Oh! And then I gathered you all together and started telling you about it. First, I said—
914003 Well, that sounds like quite a trip!
91400e And Cheese Sandwich just left his own factory?
914007 Yup. But I think Sans Smirk's hooves were the perfect ones to leave it in. As much as Cheese was born to wander Equestria and make ponies laugh in-person, Sans was born to run that factory.
914008 And you don't sound so worried about findin' your life's purpose anymore.
914007 Nope! I figured out Cheese and I are pretty much the same. We both need to see ponies laughing to feel fulfilled. And I already do that. My life is purposing itself all over the place!
91400d [giggles] I agree completely.
914007 Thanks. Oh! I almost forgot! I got you all a little something from my trip. Who likes peanut brittle?
914000 [boom!]
914000 [squeak!]
914012 [laughing]
914000 [credits]
915000 [bird chirping]
915003 I have to admit I was a little shocked when Princess Celestia told me she wanted to start a scholastic buckball league. But I was even more surprised that she wanted the first game to be between her school and ours! Apparently, she's a huge sports fan.
915007 Always thought Celestia was kind of a jock, just with really wavy hair.
915003 Anyway, we don't have much time. The game is in two weeks, and I want all of you to coach the team!
915000 [excited chattering]
91500e [hyperventilating]
915003 I know how you feel. Young athletes ready to take the field. Ooh, you could almost breathe in the excitement!
91500e [gasps]
915035 I don't think you should breathe it in so hard.
915000 [splash!]
91500e It's just... Two weeks doesn't feel like a whole lot of time to train a whole team.
915007 Mmmmaybe the School of Magic could play a few other schools first. Like the Mane and Tail Styling College or the Scroll-Making Institute?
915003 Relax. You're gonna do just fine.
91500e Um, [gasps] what makes you so sure?
915003 Because I have faith in my friends, who also happen to be the best buckball players in Equestria!
915007 Oh, yeah!
915000 [squeaks]
915000 [music]
915000 [smack!]
915000 [whoosh!]
91500e I guess that is sort of true.
915003 I asked Rainbow Dash to help, too. But I'm not sure when she—
915000 [whooshes]
91500c Sorry I'm late! But when Twilight said she needed my help with the buckball team, I figured I'd better grab every piece of coaching equipment I could find! So what should I focus on? Offense? Defense? Trick plays?
915003 I was thinking of something even more important.
91500c Awesome! Lay it on me. Whatever it is, I'll give it a hundred and twenty percent!
915003 I knew I could count on your enthusiasm! That's why I want you to coach the cheer squad!
915000 [thud]
91500c Cheerleading?!
915000 [theme song]
915000 [music]
91500c I don't mean to sound ungrateful. It's just when you said you wanted my help with something important, I thought you meant something important.
915003 The cheer squad is important.
91500c [laughs hysterically] Oh. Well, sure, cheer squad is totally important to somepony who isn't me. But I'm more about ponies playing in the game, not cheering for it.
915000 [students laughing]
91500c I mean, it's great that some ponies only want to cheer, though I don't know why they would.
915003 Hmmm. Well, maybe this will be a good opportunity for you to find out.
91500c Of course I've seen cheer squads before – on the sidelines – but I'm not even a hundred percent sure what they do. I'll probably just mess it up.
915003 I think you might be surprised. In fact, I'm more sure than ever that you're the perfect choice.
915036 I'm actually one hundred and twenty percent sure. And it's a good thing, too. The cheer squad really needs you.
91500c What do you mean?
915036 Well, I've been helping out, and let's put it this way. We've got two weeks until the big game, and... we could use two years. But that's all gonna change because you're here to save the day!
91500c Okay... So why are you here?
915036 What? A pony can't show school spirit?
91500c You don't even go to this school.
915036 Uh, okay. When I went to the Buckball Hall of Fame, I found out buckball souvenirs are big bits. If Twilight's team does well, I could start selling them full-time in Ponyville! So I have a vested interest, and you have an assistant coach! [blows whistle]
91500c Ugh.
9154fd [giggling]
9154fe [valley girl accent] She's here!
9154ff [valley girl accent] Get the lights!
915000 [rhythmically] Over and over and over again!
9154fe [Lighthoof]
915000 [rhythmically] We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!
91500c Dancing. Right. I've seen you two around school, haven't I?
9154ff [laughs] I'm Shimmy Shake, and this is Lighthoof.
9154fe And we are your lead dancers.
915000 [beat]
91500c I didn't know you three would be here.
915187 [laughs] Yona want to cheer and make pony pyramid!
915000 [stomping]
915189 And I thought this could be my chance to make an impression on everypony. You know, for something other than changing shape.
91500c I didn't realize you were into school spirit, Smolder.
915186 Eh. I just came with these two. Guess they think you can make cheer squad cool or something.
91500c Don't count on it.
915036 Okay! Now that we're all here, why don't you tell us the plan? How are you gonna make us into the most awesome cheer squad ever?
91500c Eh... I'unno.
915500 [groan]
91500c I mean, if you guys were an actual buckball team, I'd have plenty of ideas. But I don't know anything about cheerleading.
915036 Oh! [laughs] Yes! Good one, coach! But Headmare Twilight picked you for the job, so I'm pretty sure you know what you're doing.
91500c If you say so.
915036 [laughs] Right. Okay, gang, let's show Rainbow Dash what we've been working on, and she can take it from there.
915187 Cheer squad can do that!
915000 [stomping]
9154fe Yup. All we need is a little music!
915000 [up-tempo music playing]
9154ff Over... and over... and over a...gain!
915000 [stomping]
9154fe We want to dance... for each other and for all of our friends!
915186 [unenthusiastically] Two, four, six, eight.
915189 [quietly] Uh... friendship school is really... great.
915000 [stomping]
915000 [crash!]
915186 Well, that was a disaster.
9154ff It's kind of hard to stick to our choreography when the floor is moving.
9154fe [scoffs] Yeah, Yona, your stomps are a little too powerful.
915187 Can we make pony pyramid instead?
915189 Maybe we should figure out what cheers we should do first.
915186 [scoffs, sarcastically] Yeah, because that'll fix everything.
915036 So, I mean, there's a few... uh, a lot of problems, but nothing you can't solve, right?
91500c Huh? Oh, yeah. Listen, you guys don't have anything to worry about.
915186 We don't?
91500c Nope. In fact, I think what you all just did is totally fine. You guys have got this. So, uh, I'm just gonna head down to the field. Uh, great practice, everypony!
915000 [whoosh]
915000 [door slams]
91500c Ugh! What are you doing?
915036 [grunting] What are you doing?! You've got to come back and coach the squad!
91500c I watched them cheer stuff. Looked fine to me.
915036 [grunts] Well, it's not! Do you know what'll happen if they do what they just did at the big game?
91500c Uh, nothing?
915036 Uh, wrong!
91500c Ooh!
915036 A good cheer squad gets the fans excited, which gets the team excited. But if nopony's excited, then no... pony... buys... any... souvenirs!
91500c I think you're blowing this a little out of proportion.
915036 Point is, if I'm going to make any bits at these games, that squad has to get better. And to do that, they need a coach.
91500c [gasps] You know what? You're right! Why don't you do it? I mean, you're the one with a vested interest.
915035 The trick to being a good buckball keeper is to do nothin'. Just empty your mind. Be the ball.
915501 Uh, balls don't have minds.
915035 Exactly.
915000 [music]
915502 Uh, where's my blindfold?
915484 My turn!
915501 I want to do that!
915484 Over here!
915186 Why are you watching Snails' weird practice when you're supposed to be practicing with us?
91500c [chuckles] Snails' practice is definitely weird. Uh, I thought Snips was practicing with you.
915186 He was.
9154ff [sighs] Do you have any idea how hard it is to dance in this stuff?
915189 [softly] Plus all these buttons jingle so much, you can't hear my cheers.
915186 Speaking up might help a little.
91500c So don't dance and cheer.
915187 Uh, then what cheer squad do?
91500c I dunno.
915186 [angrily] Maybe you should! [calmly] Or whatever. You're the coach! You're supposed to come up with stuff for us to do.
91500c Okay. I've got something for you to do.
915035 Just do nothing. Empty your minds. Be the squad.
915186 We are the squad.
915035 Oh, yeah.
915036 At least helping sell my souvenirs was... something.
915187 Yona still not understand how this make us better. Huh? Professor Dash needs to stay and coach!
91500c [groans] You guys asked me to come up with something, and I did.
915186 I don't think nothing counts.
91500c Then I'm out of ideas.
915035 This is the School of Friendship. If you need ideas, you should ask your friends for help.
91500c Ugh, fine.
915000 [montage music]
915000 [party cannon squeak]
91500c Okay. Since you guys have been nagging me nonstop about this cheer stuff for, like, ever...
915186 It has literally been one day.
91500c ...I went around and got everything you need!
915000 [music]
915186 Uh, what're we supposed to do with hay?
91500c Beats me, but Applejack seemed pretty sure about it. Oh, I almost forgot.
915189 A rhyming dictionary?
91500c Yeah. Zecora's a lot less helpful than you'd think. That's from the library so you can come up with cheers. Okay! Good practice!
915186 So, you're just leaving again?
91500c Ugh! Look. I talked to my friends, and they said this is the stuff you need. Wouldn't a true cheer squad be able to figure out what to do with it?
9154fe But Fluttershy and Pinkie wanted us to show 'em everything we come up with tomorrow!
9154ff They want us to get the team all excited before the big game!
91500c Well, then it's a good thing I got you all this stuff. You better get to work!
915000 [whoosh]
915000 [door slams]
915036 Don't look at me.
915000 [music]
91500e Good work, everypony! Let's take a break!
91500c [whistles] Yeah! [whistles] Wow! This team is really shaping up! Nice job!
91500e Thanks. I'm excited to see what you've been up to.
915007 Yeah! I can't wait to see the cheer squad!
91500c [laughs hysterically] Oh. You're serious.
915007 Woo-hoo! Go, team! This is so exciting!
91500e Well, I'm sure you've put in a lot of hard work.
91500c How much work does cheer squad need?
915036 Anypony want to buy an official School of Friendship cheer squad headband? Now I personally would buy them before the performance!
91536e Huh?
915000 [up-tempo music playing]
915000 [stomping]
9154ff [Shimmy Shake]
9154ff Over... and over... and over again!
915000 [stomping continues]
9154fe [Lighthoof]
9154fe We wanna dance for each other and for all of our friends!
915186 [Smolder]
915000 [unenthusiastically] School of Friendship, rah, rah, rah
915189 [Ocellus]
915189 Let's win this game and hit the... oh, what rhymes with "rah"? Spa?
915000 [stomping continues]
915000 [record needle scratches]
915000 [stomping continues]
9154fd Yona!
915000 [creak]
915000 [party cannon squeak]
915186 [blusters]
915007 I know I said I couldn't wait to see the cheer squad, but maybe I could've waited just a teensy bit longer.
91500c Oh, yeah! Nice one! Huh? What?
91500c I don't know what everypony's so upset about. So it wasn't great. Cheerleading's never great. That's why everypony gets up to get a snack during it.
915187 [bawls loudly]
91500c What is the big deal?
9154ff If you don't know, there's no point in us trying to explain it to you!
9154fe Lead dancers, out!
9154fd Hmph!
915186 It's not that we were bad. It's that you didn't even want to try to help us get better!
91500c I didn't try? What are you talking about?! I got you a party cannon! It's not my fault you couldn't figure out how to use it right.
915189 [loudly] Well, you could have shown us! [sobbing]
91500c Whoa. Ponies might actually care about cheer squad if she cheered like that all the time.
915186 Why would you say ponies don't care about cheer squad?
91500c Because they don't.
915186 No. You don't. But they do! I bet Headmare Twilight does! And you know what? I do, too! I actually got excited when I found out you were gonna be our coach! I figured if anypony can make cheer squad awesome, it's you!
91500c Me? Why?
915186 Because everything's always awesome with you! Or twenty percent cooler! Or whatever! You're the most enthusiastic pony in Equestria when it's something you care about. I just wish we were one of those things.
915000 [door opens, closes]
915036 And it looks like my assistant cheer coach/souvenir selling business is a bust. So I'm gonna take off, unless you can think of something else for me to do.
91500c Maybe I can.
915503 [snoring]
915036 [blows whistle]
915187 Yaks hate loud noises!
915189 Aah!
915036 Squad meeting! Outside! ASAP!
915000 [new age music]
915000 [record needle scratches]
915036 [blows whistle] Dance ponies, buckball field, pronto!
915000 [thud]
915186 [snoring]
915036 [blows whistle] Hey, dragon! Get out here and join your squad!
915186 So, what? Is there some new button you wanna sell?
915036 Not a button.
915000 [whooshes]
915500 Ugh...
915186 Not this again.
9154fe Sorry. We're not buying.
91500c Wait! Look, I know I haven't been a great coach because I don't care about cheerleading. But all of you do, and I care about you. So I guess maybe I care about cheer squad. And a good friend reminded me that I can make anything I care about totally awesome. So from now on, I'm gonna give this thing a hundred and twenty percent, and I expect the same from you. We are gonna dance! We are gonna cheer! We're gonna make the biggest pony pyramid Equestria's ever seen! And when we're done, we're gonna make sure everypony on that field is so pumped up, they'll forget they even came to see a game!
915036 Ah! But not so pumped up that they forget to buy a pennant or a button or a quality souvenir T-shirt.
915000 [beat]
915036 What?
915000 [montage music]
915000 [stomping]
91500c [blows whistle in time with stomping]
91500c [blows whistle]
915000 [music continues]
915000 [hissing]
91500c [coughing]
915000 [hissing]
915000 [party cannon squeak]
915500 [laughs]
915000 [crowd cheering]
915003 Yahoo!
915019 I realize the game of buckball traditionally requires an Earth pony, a Pegasus, and a unicorn, but I appreciate you allowing my students to compete.
915003 Of course, and the wings and magical-dampening ring you made seem to be working really well.
915019 Indeed, though not as well as your team. [echoing] COME ON, SCHOOL OF MAGIC!
91500e Ohhhh! The suspense is horrible! I'm the most nervous I've ever been, and that's saying something.
91500c I know how you feel!
915007 Don't worry! Celestia's team might be tough, but we can still win this thing!
91500c What? Oh, yeah, totally. But I wasn't talking about the game. Come on, come on, come on, come on!
915000 [cheering]
915124 And that's the end of the first half!
91500c Aaah! Sorry! Can't talk right now!
91500e I sure hope Dash being nervous is a good sign.
915000 [ponies chattering]
915000 [up-tempo music playing]
915000 [stomping]
9154ff [Shimmy Shake]
9154ff Over and over and over again!
9154fe [Lighthoof]
9154fe We'll cheer for our team 'til the ve-ry end!
915000 [rhythmic stomping]
915000 [crowd cheering]
915186 [blows smoke]
915189 [Ocellus]
915189 Everypony in the crowd, if you're feeling hip
915189 When I say "friend-", you say "-ship"!
915189 Friend!
9150ec [Crowd]
9150ec Ship!
915189 [Ocellus]
915189 Friend!
9150ec [Crowd]
9150ec Ship!
915189 [Ocellus]
915189 Welcome, everypony, to the halftime show
915189 We're the friendship squad, and we're ready to go!
915189 We're here to cheer and get you all excited
915189 If you'd like to join in, then you're all invited!
915189 It's a simple cheer, so don't chime in late
91504d [All]
91504d It goes two, four, six, GREAT!
915000 [party cannon squeak]
915000 [flames whooshing]
915000 [cheers and applause]
91500c [laughs] Not bad, right?
91536e They... were... awesome!
915500 [laughing]
91500c Well, they have a pretty decent coach.
915500 [laughing]
915000 [crowd cheering]
915124 And that's the game. Final score — School of Magic, five; School of Friendship, four.
91500e Nice work, everyone. You can't win them all.
915007 Sometimes, that's just how the cupcake crumbles.
91500c You guys were amazing!
915504 [groans]
91500c It was flawless. I can't think of any way that could've been better!
915186 We could have won the game.
91500c [scoffs] The game was just a sideshow. You guys were the main event!
915019 I'm glad to see such good sportsponyship on display. Your cheer squad was an inspiration, Rainbow Dash. I'll have to start one at my school as well.
915003 Wow, Rainbow Dash! It's almost like you were the perfect pony to coach cheer squad after all!
91500c Wait a second. Was this one of those things where you knew the lesson I needed to learn before I learnt it?
915003 You mean like how you don't have to care about a thing other ponies like as long as you care about the ponies who like it? Nope. Don't know what you're talking about.
91500c Ugh!
915019 Nicely done.
91504d [laughing]
915000 [credits]
916005 Okay, Spike. You know you might get distracted by the stacks of books and copious charts, so remember what to say. "Twilight, I know you're in full prep mode for Trivia Trot tomorrow, but you need to get some sleep!" Huh. [laughs] Nice work. You got this.
916000 [door opens]
916005 [gasps] This is weird.
916000 [thud]
916005 Twilight! What are you doing?
916003 Great question, Spike! And the answer is...
916000 [bell rings]
916003 ...going to bed! Brains need eight hours of sleep to perform at optimum levels!
916005 Oh. Cool. I thought I'd have to force you to go to bed since tomorrow is your chance to be the first pony to win Ponyville Trivia three times in a row. That is tomorrow, right?
916003 The answer is...
916000 [bell rings]
916003 ...yes! Ask me another one.
916005 Another what?
916003 Another question! I want to stay in the zone. That way, I can sleep in the zone! Wake up in the zone! And be totally in the zone tomorrow!
916000 [beat]
916005 Uh, this is a whole new level of "Twilight-ing", isn't it? Heh.
916003 The answer is...
916000 [bell rings]
916003 ...yes!
916005 Are you okay?
916003 The answer is...
916000 [bell rings]
916003 ...yes!
916005 Well, good night, Twilight. Good luck with your brain sleep and getting that third win. [chuckles]
916003 The answer is...
916000 [bell rings]
916003 ...good night! And yes!
916005 That wasn't a question.
916000 [theme song]
916003 I'm glad you decided to come watch your first Trivia Trot, Spike. I hope the rules aren't too confusing.
916005 Rules? Isn't trivia just asking questions and answering them?
916003 [laughs] The Trot is a little more involved than that. Let's start with the first category of rules. [reading] "Categories. Rule one - Each category must be categorically designated and thoroughly researched in all categorical..."
916003 "...participating in Trivia Trot." And that wraps up rule forty-one point six. Of course, the exception to that – rule forty-one point six A – is interesting itself because—
916005 Oh, look! We're here!
916003 Ooh! I can't wait to see who my partner's gonna be!
916005 You don't get to pick your own team?
916003 Rule twenty point one six B, Spike. To keep things fair, the teams are randomly selected.
916005 [sarcastically] Twenty point one six B. How could I forget?
916003 And based on the regular attendees, I've charted every potential teammate's strengths and weaknesses, plus my percentage of winning with each one!
916005 Ha! I knew there'd be a chart! Glad I'm just watching. I don't think I could handle being your teammate. What if I let you down?
916003 [laughs] You could never let me down, Spike. But I'm glad you're watching, too. I'm going to need all the support I can get for win number three!
916000 [door opens]
916000 [indistinct conversations]
916008 Well, well, well, if it ain't our reignin' champ. Think you can win again this week, Twilight?
916003 Everypony here has a different area of expertise, so it really is anypony's game. But yes!
91600c Then you better hope you get paired with me, because I am gonna rule this game!
916000 [door opens]
916315 We'll just see about that! I didn't come all the way from the Crystal Empire to lose. And I hope you realize I have the highest percentage of correct answers, and I aim to keep it that way.
91600c [whickers] I hope you realize not every category is gonna be "Spells So Old, Not Even Star Swirl the Bearded Remembers Them".
91600e I hope there's one on fur maintenance for adorable creatures, because I've been 'brushing up'. [giggles]
916040 [chitters angrily]
91644f Technically, that was a category last week.
916242 It won't be in the game tonight.
916003 Rule thirty-seven point two C. No back-to-back categories. But I think Fluttershy was joking.
916000 [door opens]
916007 Sure sounded like a joke to me! [giggles] Woo-hoo!
916003 Pinkie Pie?!
916007 Present!
916000 [dramatic musical sting]
916003 [panicked muttering]
916005 What's wrong, Twilight?
916003 I hadn't anticipated Pinkie Pie as a potential player! She's never played before! My chart is completely off! I have no way to predict what'll happen, and unpredictable is not good for a Trivia Trot three-peat!
916005 Do I have to do that thing where I list all your successes as Princess of Friendship to put things into perspective and remind you this is just a game?
916003 Spike! This has nothing to do with being the Princess of Friendship! And this is not just a game! This! Is! Trivia Trot!
916000 [tapping]
916009 Okay, settle down, everypony. I'm fixin' to pick these here teams.
916000 [crowd cheers]
916003 [gasps] It's starting! I have to reevaluate my chart! Spike, I need you to find the part on matchups! Can you look outside?
916000 [teleportation zap]
916000 [door opens]
916005 What'd I miss?
916003 Granny's about to call out the fifth team. Sunburst gave me the highest chance of winning, but he's been paired with Cranky Doodle!
91615c [mumbles, muttering] What? Who's that?
916003 At least Rainbow Dash and Applejack aren't together. Team Apple-Dash is basically unstoppable.
916008 [growls]
91600c [growls]
916003 And apart they'll spend all their energy trying to one-up each other, so that only helps my chances.
91617b Let's do this! Yeah!
916003 Eh, not every team is a threat, but there aren't many ponies left.
916009 All righty, hold on to your horseshoes, 'cause the next pair of players is... Maud and Mudbriar!
916000 [crowd groans]
916005 What's wrong?
916003 Maud and Mudbriar have been paired together every week. It's a statistical improbability! Which would be fine if they weren't so good.
916000 [sizzling]
916003 [deep gasp] Oh, no! According to my calculations, the only pony who could really threaten my winning streak is...!
916009 And our final pair of contestants for this week's Trivia Trot is... Twilight and Pinkie Pie!
916007 Twilight! It's you and me! Isn't that great?
916000 [clatter]
916003 Yeah. Great.
916005 So, I'm guessing the one pony who could mess up your winning streak is Pinkie?
916007 Twilight! I can't believe we're partners for a game! I love games! And I'm super duper excited for this game because it'll be my first time ever playing, and I get to play with you, which makes it even funner!
916000 [zip!]
916007 Twilight and Pinkie Pie forever! Ooh! We could be Team Twinkie! Or [gasps] Team Pink-Light! [gasps] Sparkle Pie! No-no-no-no! [gasps] Twi-Pie! [squee]
916003 Pinkie, I'm glad you're excited, but tonight's game is special. I could be the first pony ever to win three consecutive Trots in a row. And I'm really hoping I do.
916007 You don't have anything to worry about. I'll do everything I can to be the bestest and most funnest teammate ever.
916000 [bell ringing]
916005 So... still think you can win?
916003 [exhales] I know I can. Pinkie might not be the partner I expected, but I can coach her along. And besides, I'm pretty good at this game. If she misses a few, I'm sure I can pick up the slack.
916000 [airhorn blows]
916007 Let's get this party started!
916003 [laughs nervously]
916009 Now, the first order of business is we need somepony to keep score.
916005 I'll do it!
916008 [laughs] I'm not sure you wanna take that job, Spike. The score-keepin' can get a mite intense.
916315 Yeah. Starlight used to do it, but now... Well, I can't even say the word "trivia" around her.
916009 [scoffs] Apple mash. Don't let them scare ya. You'll be fine. Now, let the games begin!
916000 [crowd cheers]
916008 Applejack:
916008 Get ready to get squashed! Hey, don't copy me!
91600c Rainbow Dash:
91600c Get ready to get squished! Hey, don't copy me!
916009 The first category is "Literary Figures".
916000 [crowd groans]
916003 Ooh! A category about books! We're off to a great start!
916007 [giggles]
916009 [clears throat] Who is the pony that despises the holiday season in the old classic A Hearth's Warmin' Tale?
916000 [bell rings]
916007 The answer is nopony! Because everypony ends up loving the holiday with singing, festive cakes, and thoughtful presents!
916000 [beat]
916009 Well, as much as that ain't exactly wrong, it ain't exactly right neither.
916007 [laughs nervously]
916003 [whines]
916005 Just doing my job, Twilight.
916003 [sighs]
916007 Sorry. I didn't know we could have negative points.
916003 It's fine, Pinkie. But maybe it'll help our chances if I coach you as we go. Tip one – try sitting still.
916007 Can do, Coach Twilight—
916003 And don't get distracted. Or be distracting. Oh, and remember to listen carefully. Also, it's best to keep quiet between questions.
916007 Got it.
916007 [whimpers] Sitting still, sitting still, sitting still...! [continues under]
916009 Which topographical locale used to be a cavern, but after thousands of years of erosion, is now a gorge?
916003 Pinkie!
916007 What?!
916000 [bell rings]
916242 The answer is the Ghastly Gorge.
916009 That is one hundred percent correct!
916008 [chomp]
916009 The next category is "Apples"!
91600c Rigged!
916008 I didn't hear you complain when the category was "Wonderbolt History".
91600c But... [stutters] that-that's totally different!
916003 Okay, Pinkie. Remember, the category is "Apples". Keep your mind on apples.
916007 Apples, apples, apples, apples... Ooh, and oranges. And grapes! And strawberries. [gasps] Strawberry cupcakes! I'm hungry.
916009 Which variety of apple only blooms for five days?
91600c [coughs] Don't choke. [whistles]
916008 Now, why would I choke on a question about apples? Uh... What was the question again?
916009 You kiddin' me?
916003 Come on, Pinkie, you know this one. Mysterious apples? Only around for five days?
916007 [gasps]
916000 [stomach growls]
916007 Quiet down there. Pretty sure there's a rule against tummies ringing in.
916000 [bell rings]
91600e Um, I'm just guessing, but is it zap apples?
916009 Finally! Yes, Fluttershy, it is. At least somepony here knows her apples.
91617b Yeah!
916000 [thud]
91600e [weak laugh]
916000 [stomach growls]
916005 One minute left in the refreshment/bathroom break—! Aah!
916003 Spike! I don't think I can coach Pinkie well enough for us to get my three-peat! I don't want her to feel bad! She's trying so hard, but I might have to start answering everything myself!
916007 Look, Twilight! No more belly growl interruptions for Team Twi-Pie! [chomps, gulps]
916005 Maybe instead of focusing on Pinkie, you should just focus on how you're playing.
916003 Or... I should look at how everypony else is playing.
916009 Hope you're all in your seats 'cause the break is over, and it is time for more questions. [muttering] Let me see, uh... How do you say "reward" in Olde Ponish?
916007 [gasps]
916000 [smack!]
916000 [bell rings]
91615c [snoring]
916315 "Reward" in Olde Ponish is "hliet".
916009 Correct!
916003 Sleeping!
916000 [crowd muttering]
916003 [clears throat] Sunburst's partner is sleeping. And according to rule fifty-seven point six, sleeping on the table is subject to dis-qual-i-fi-ca-tion!
916009 Oh, looky here. That's an actual rule. Cranky is disqualified. I'm sorry, Sunburst. Without your teammate, you can't play neither.
916315 Aw, fine! But I'm counting that as a correct answer! [groans] Can't even stay awake for five minutes...
916003 Don't worry, Pinkie. We're not out of this game yet.
916040 [whispering]
91600e [gasps]
916000 [bell rings]
91600e Is the answer carrots?
916003 Ah! Rule thirteen point two! No help from pets!
916008 Nyah!
91600c Nyah!
916003 Rule seventy-two point eight! No sticking tongues out at opponents!
916003 Motion to establish new rule! No expressionless contestants!
916009 Nice try.
916003 Fine.
916009 The next category is... "Cupcakes"!
916007 [gasps] Twilight! I know all about those! You have to let me help!
916003 [exhales heavily] Suuuure! Just when we're finally back in the game! [laughs crazily] Why, that sounds perfect, Pinkie, but... Ooh! Isn't that a confetti appreciation parade I see?
916007 Where?!
916000 [zip!]
916009 What flavor cupcakes did Princess Celestia order for Princess Luna's surprise birthday party last year?
916007 Wait, what?!
916000 [bell rings]
916003 Double midnight chocolate fudge with chili pepper frosting!
916009 Correct!
916007 Hey! I knew that! I made those cupcakes!
916003 Sorry, Pinkie. But you were looking at the parade, and I didn't want our team to miss out on the point.
916007 I guess that makes sense, but which way did that confetti parade go anyway?
916000 [bell rings]
916003 1547 Pony B.E.!
916000 [smack!]
916000 [bell rings]
916003 Vanhoover!
916000 [splat]
916000 [bell rings]
916003 Cutie Pox!
916000 [bell rings]
916003 Bananaaaaas!
916009 The category is "Sticks and Stones".
916003 [brays] I don't know anything about those! That's not any kind of category!
91644f Technically, it's a kind of category where we know the answers and you don't.
916003 [hyperventilating]
916007 Don't worry, fellow Twi-Pie. I grew up on a rock farm. I'm sure I know some of these.
916003 [hyperventilating faster]
916009 What kind of stone can be used to start a fire?
916000 [bell rings]
916007 The black one!
916242 The answer is flint.
916007 Yeah, that one! We both get points, right?
916315 Sorry, Pinkie. Rule four – answers must be specific and exact. I'd help you if I could. I know this category pretty well.
916003 Gee, Pinkie! I forgot the name of that famous rock in Griffonstone. Could you ask Maud?
916007 You got it! Hey, Maud! What's the name of the famous rock in Griffonstone?
916242 Pinkie, you can't ask me that.
916007 Sure I can. I just did.
916000 [crowd muttering]
916007 What?
916009 You can't go and ask another player about rocks when that's the category. It's in the rulebook. Where's... Sorry, Pinkie, but you're disqualified.
916007 What?!
916000 [loud thud]
916007 I-I can't believe I'm disqualified! [whines]
916003 [laughs nervously] I'm sorry, Pinkie. Guess I forgot about that rule.
916007 Oh, no! If I'm out, you don't have a partner! You won't be able to get your third win!
916003 Actually, since there's another player who has also had his teammate disqualified...
916315 Rule nineteen point seven B, whereby players whose teammates were disqualified may form a new team.
916007 Oh. Okay. Um, I'll just cheer you on from... over there.
916000 [balloons deflate]
916009 The next category is "Ancient Legends".
916003 Oh, we're gonna crush this round!
916315 I don't know, Twilight. You seem out of the zone today. But don't worry. I can pick up the slack.
916003 What?! I am the reigning Trot champ! If there's any slack that needs picking, I'll be the up! I mean, wait...
916315 I'm just saying you seem a little frazzled, and I do have a correct answer percentage to maintain.
916009 Who traveled to Equestria from a distant land seeking to steal the magic from its pony inhabitants?
916000 [bell rings]
916003 That would be Lord Tirek!
916000 [bell rings]
91644f Technically, that answer is incomplete. The answer is Lord Tirek and Scorpan.
916003 But Scorpan tried to convince Tirek not to do it, so technically he wasn't part of it, even if he started out—! [groans] Never mind.
916000 [montage music]

916003 Look, Sunburst. I realize I may have been a little off earlier, but I'm really good at this game.
916009 How many holes are there in Daring Do's hat?
916000 [bell rings]
91600c Twenty!
916009 Correct!
91600c Ha!
916315 Twilight, I knew that one! You just cost us a point and the correct answer I needed to boost my percentage!
916003 Well, I knew it, too. You're not the only pony to ever read a book, you know?
916315 You're right, Twilight. I'm sorry. But now that I think about it, I'm not so sure about Dash's answer. Could you do a quick fact check?
916003 Oh, I know it's twenty. But if you want proof... Wait! According to rule eighteen point three, I can't check outside reference material.
916000 [teleportation zap]
916003 [gasps] Are you trying to get me disqualified?! What kind of pony would do that to their own teammate?!
916315 You're right, Twilight. I don't know what got into me. I was so focused on my correct answers, I wasn't thinking straight. Can you forgive me?
916003 It's okay, Sunburst. I understand. And I have a teammate of my own to apologize to. Lucky for you, Cranky's awake. And according to rule fifty-seven point six B...
916315 Players previously disqualified for sleeping may rejoin the game. Provided they're well-rested.
91615c [mutters] Where am I? What time is it? Where are my morning haycakes?!
916003 Pinkie, you were the best teammate I could ask for, but I let wanting to win keep me from seeing that.
916007 [scoffs] I knew you wanted to win, but I probably could have helped a little. And even if I couldn't...
916003 ...we still could've had fun. I'm so sorry for not realizing it. I got so obsessed with one thing, I forgot what really mattered.
916007 [sarcastically] No! That doesn't sound like you at all!
916003 Well, win or lose, nothing is more important than my friend. Or my team. Twi-Pie forever?
916007 I-I don't know.
916003 I understand. I guess even the Princess of Friendship can mess things up with her friends.
916007 Oh, it's not that. It's just that I already changed it to Team Twi-Burst, and now I guess I should change it to Sun-Doodle? [chomps]
916003 Actually, I have a better idea.
916003 According to rule thirteen point two, players can join the game at any time, provided they start from zero.
916007 Wow. These rules are really convoluted. But doesn't starting from zero mean we'll lose?
916003 Well, our chances aren't good, but the odds of having fun on Team Twi-Pie are one hundred percent!
916009 What is the name of the Ponyville Day Spa's most popular candle?
916000 [bell rings]
916007 Pinkie Pie:
916007 Candlelicious Melty Wax!
916003 Twilight Sparkle:
916003 Competitive Library Musk!
916009 Uh... no.

917485 [clears throat] Where are ya goin'?
9174cf Since you three were unable to retrieve my Bewitching Bell, we need another source of great magical power to defeat Twilight and her friends.
917485 [singsongy] He's gone!
91726d I don't trust him.
917485 None of us do.
91719c Which is why double-crossing him with his own bell will be so satisfying.
91726d If we can figure out how to use it.
91719c Hmmm...
917000 [rattling]
917485 Twilight Sparkle may be the worst, but she does know stuff. She once said the Archives in Canterlot has a restricted area.
91726d Celestia and Luna love to hoard information for themselves. If there's an answer, it's there.
91719c My triumphant return to Canterlot? I like the sound of that.
917485 Oh, my gosh! Road trip!
917000 [theme song]
917000 [door opens]
917019 Sorry to interrupt. We know you're busy planning the Summer Sun Celebration as we requested. But...
91701a Oh! Things seem, uh, calmer than we would've expected.
917005 No complaints here.
917003 With the exception of the odd trivia night, I've made a lot of progress since the Royal Swanifying Ceremony. You may not know this about me, but I occasionally freak out.
917000 [beat]
917003 That was a joke. I wanted to show you with the Summer Sun Celebration how much I've improved. So I focused on delegating and trusting others. It's been great!
91701a That's... actually what we came to talk to you about. This may be the last Summer Sun Celebration you'll need to plan.
917003 Did I do something wrong?
917019 Of course not. It's just that the Celebration has always been about us. My defeat of Luna...
91701a ...and, thanks to you and your friends, my reunion with my sister.
917019 Now that we're leaving, we don't see a need for the holiday any longer.
917003 Now that you're...
917019 My sister and I have decided. The time for us to retire is upon us. You and your friends have proven you are ready to lead Equestria. So let this be the last Summer Sun Celebration as Equestria leaves behind the old to embrace the new!
917003 [gulps]
91700d My goodness! How are you feeling about all this?
917007 Something like this could definitely send you into full freaky-outy mode!
917003 I'm actually fine. But if this is gonna be the last Summer Sun Celebration, I want to make sure it's the best Celebration ever!
91700c [whispering] Please-don't-give-us-more-work... Please-don't-give-us-more-work... Please-don't-give-us-more-work...
917003 So, even though everything was done, I thought of a few last-minute changes I could use your help with.
91700c [groans] I knew it!
9170db [echoing] Oh, the end of a beloved holiday? Last-minute changes to a celebration?
917000 [poof!]
9170db That sounds positively chaotic!
917008 What are you doin' here?
9170db I've known Celestia and Luna longer than any of you. I terrorized them, they turned me into stone...
917000 [crack]
917000 [crumble]
9170db If this is the last Summer Sun Situation, I simply can't miss it. Well, I see I've arrived just in time for the "Twilight gives her friends an impossibly long and overly detailed list" predicament.
917003 I guess some draconequus isn't the know-it-all he thinks he is.
91700c This is it?
917003 What?
91700c We were kinda with Discord on this one.
917003 No more crazy lists. No more freaking out. With your help, I know we've got this.
9170db [groans] Character growth is so boring. Do I at least get my own note card?
917003 There. Now, I need to go rewrite my speech. But if you all look at your cards, you'll see—
9170db Can't talk now. Have so much to get done before sunrise. [snaps fingers]
917000 [poof!]
917000 [clatter]
91726d Why are so many ponies up in the middle of the night?
917485 It's that silly sun holiday.
91719c How many holidays do you ponies have? No matter. Getting into the castle won't be a problem.
91726d Are you sure about that?
917000 [fans whirring]
917000 [bird chirping]
91719c Oh. Those are new. But even so...
917000 [transformation noise]
917000 [wood creaking]
91719c [affected voice] Transfer. Have to head inside. Open up.
917000 [door opens]
917000 [door closes]
91719c Right. Of course. [laughs nervously]
917000 [thuds]
91719c Uh, do yours get glitchy too? More medallions, more problems, am I right?
91719c [normal voice] They've increased security into the castle. This is going to be more challenging than I thought.
917000 [transformation noise]
917000 [poof!]
91700c Could you not go popping us all over the place, please?!
9170db Time is of the essence. Let's go, team!
91700e We need to know what we're doing before we go and do it.
917008 Pinkie, you and I are givin' Braeburn and the Appleloosan ponies some adjustments to the menu.
91700c Fluttershy and I are meeting the Pegasi from Cloudsdale to give them changes to the weather.
91700d Spike, we're going to update the Flaming Sky Firework Unicorn Troupe with Twilight's new vision.
9170db And I'm supposed to... [reading] "make sure Discord doesn't do anything 'Discord-y'"? Well, that's annoyingly specific!
91726d Increased security on a crowded holiday with Twilight and her friends bumbling around? This is impossible.
91719c Oh, no. This is perfect. We need a distraction, and those ridiculous ponies just gave it to us. Now, do exactly as I tell you.
917000 [ponies gasp]
917007 Step away from the wagons! Official food-tasters here on official food-tasting business! [eating noisily]
91709c [sighs] Well, it ain't gonna be easy. But I think we can whip up these new cookies Twilight wants before sunrise.
917008 If anypony can handle some last-minute bakin', Braeburn, it's y'all.
917007 [chomps, gulps]
91709c We brought plenty for the Celebration. But if she keeps testin', we might be in trouble.
917007 [chomps, gulps] But I see a suspicious-looking cookie!
917000 [magic sounds]
91709c You okay?
917000 [bushes rustle]
917505 I feel weak all of a sudden...
917000 [magic sounds]
91709c Is somepony back there?
917000 [magic sounds]
917506 What is it?
91709c Everypony... get away from the food... 'til we figure out what's goin' on...!
917000 [ponies screaming]
917000 [bushes rustle]
91726d [laughing]
917507 The princess wants what?!
91700c Just what's on that little card. No big deal.
917507 No big d-d—?! I-I-It's a m-much more aggressive weather pattern than what was originally ordered! This... This is... very irregular! We'll need to... No, first we must... Wait! We ca— [wails]
91700e Take a breath.
917507 [inhales]
91700e Let it out slowly.
917507 [exhales] Tell the princess we will do our best.
91700e We're sure you're doing an excellent job.
91700c Oh, yeah, totally. You're not gonna panic and screw it up at all!
917507 I... I... I'm not built for high-pressure situations!
917485 Golly. Sounds like you need some help.
917507 Who are you?
917485 Somepony who's organized enough to handle the small stuff so you can focus on the big picture!
917507 The big... Yes! That sounds right!
917485 [chuckles] This kind of weather has to be handled delicately. Good thing I'm here. I'll take care of everything.
917000 [fireworks explode]
917005 Whoa!
91700d The Flaming Sky Firework Troupe is a marvel.
917508 We take pride in what we do.
917005 These last-minute changes aren't too challenging, are they?
917508 Ha! The more challenging, the better! We aim to astound! Now, if you don't mind, we do have a new routine to prepare. Horns at the ready!
917000 [transformation noise]
91719c Very impressive.
917508 Thank you. Unfortunately, we have no room for anypony else at this time... [clears throat] I'm sorry?
91719c Crackle Cosette. And I don't want to join your silly little troupe.
917508 Pardon me?
91719c Oh, I meant no offense. It just seems a pity for unicorns to waste their talents on something so... inconsequential.
917000 [unicorns muttering]
91719c Unicorns wield magic. We are the most powerful ponies in the land. Don't you ever feel you're destined for more than... performances?
917003 It's all coming together. I really think this is gonna be the best Summer Sun Celebration ever!
91700d You've done an outstanding job.
917003 We've all done an outstanding job!
917000 [screech]
9170db And what about me? You'll be happy to know that I have been watching myself all night, and I have yet to do one "Discord-y" thing.
91701a Now, that truly is amazing.
917019 Twilight, we know you had, uh, [laughs] difficulties using the amulet to raise the sun and moon. We thought perhaps a practice session before the festivities might be in order.
917003 That's... a good idea. Thank you all so much.
917000 [doors close]
917008 I sure am proud o' her.
917005 Yeah! She finally realizes things will turn out fine, even when she isn't micromanaging every little detail.
917000 [thud]
917008 Braeburn? W-What's wrong?
91709c Earth ponies sick... Food missin'... Can't... bake... anythin'...
9171fb Something is wrong with the weather! Storms, hurricanes, fog – you name it! It's a disaster out there!
917508 Rarity! Please inform her highness that we will not be performing! A simple fireworks show is beneath us! We're better than that!
917008 What the...? Everything was fine a minute ago!
91700e Apparently, a lot can change in a minute.
917000 [ponies moaning]
917000 [thunder]
917000 [ponies panicking]
91700c It's total chaos out there!
917000 [beat]
9170db Don't look at me.
91700e What are we gonna do?
917003 Do about what?
917005 [laughs nervously] What are you doing here?
917003 I forgot these. You guys okay?
917008 Twilight, w-we're sorry, but—
91700c But, uh, we don't know what to do now that everything's all ready! [forced laugh]
917003 I guess I was too organized. I'll try to come up with a few last-minute errands for you before sunrise.
91700c [stilted] Well, that's a relief!
917008 Explain to me why we didn't tell her the truth.
91700d Oh, Twilight is finally learning not to let her stress get the better of her. If she finds out everything went wrong, it could be devastating!
91700e Oh, she would be so upset.
91700c She'll totally freak out!
917008 Well, what do y'all suggest?
917007 Ooh, ooh, ooh! Let's just fix it all before she notices. No lying necessary.
917008 I guess.
917005 We'd need a miracle.
91700c We have a miracle! Don't we?
917000 [poof!]
9170db I suppose I could fix everything. But isn't the real miracle here the miracle of teamwork and character growth?
917000 [poof!]
91700c OH, COME ON!
91700e Discord is right. Twilight needs us. Whatever happened, we can fix this.
917000 [thunder and lightning]
917005 What did happen?
917000 [ponies screaming]
917485 Best... road trip... ever!
917007 Even if I was an actual doctor, I would have no idea what's wrong.
917008 There's gotta be a reason. Something got 'em all sick. Maybe the food?
917007 I ate the food, too! Does that mean I'm sick?! Oh, nooo! [coughs]
917000 [thud]
917007 Nope! I feel fine. [chomps]
917000 [magic sounds]
917000 [thud]
917000 [unlatching sounds]
917000 [doors open]
917000 [thunder and lightning]
917507 I don't know how this happened! I'm gonna be fired for... for sure!
91700e Rainbow Dash and the Wonderbolts will have all the weather rounded up any minute.
91700c [yelling]
917000 [crash!]
91700c Or not!
917000 [door opens]
917485 Not here. The Archives are in a different part of the castle.
917000 [goose honks]
91700d What about "aiming for perfection"?
917508 We've set our sights higher.
917005 Higher than perfection?
917508 Higher than putting on a silly little show for the other ponies.
91700d But you were so excited before. What changed?
917000 [goose honks]
91719c [honks]
917000 [transformation noise]
917000 [clanking]
917000 [creak]
917003 You two just enjoy the festivities. I have a few surprises in store for— Yes, Discord?
9170db Oh, well, don't mind me. I'm just here for the chaos.
917000 [thunder and lightning]
9170db [laughs] And here we go!
917000 [whoosh]
917003 What is Rainbow Dash doing?
917000 [sloshing]
917003 Pinkie, is this soup?
917007 Yes! I... was really hungry?
917000 [unicorns grumbling]
91700d Nopony understands wanting to take pride in your work more than I do!
917509 You could do more with your magic than make frilly dresses!
91700d Oh, pffft. Nopony makes frills anymore. This season's actually all about simplicity—
917005 Not the point, Rarity!
917507 Princess! I beg your forgiveness! It's entirely my fault!
917003 What is?
917000 [thunder and lightning]
917507 That!
91700e Oh, um, just a slight hiccup in the weather. [laughs nervously]
917000 [whoosh]
917008 [grunting]
917003 Applejack, what is going on?
917008 I told y'all this was a bad idea! But nopony ever listens to me!
917003 That's it!
9174d2 [yelp, groan]
917003 I thought everything was fine! What is going on?!
917008 Everythin' was goin' fine.
917007 Until it totally wasn't.
91700e We tried to fix it ourselves.
917003 Why didn't you tell me?
91700c We didn't want you to freak out.
917003 And you thought not telling me everything was a total disaster would avoid a freak-out?!
917005 When you say it like that, it sounds like a really bad plan.
917003 [inhales]
9170db Here it comes!
917003 I know how I used to react, but I really have changed. Panicking won't solve anything. But we can handle whatever problems come our way as long as we handle them together!
917019 Spoken like a true leader. How can we help?
917003 I love a good to-do list. So tell me exactly what happened so we can figure out exactly what "to do" to fix it.

917003 [amplified] This Celebration has always been a reminder not to fear the night, for there is always a new day to look forward to. But as we look towards Equestria's future, I am sad to say today will be the last Summer Sun Celebration.
917000 [crowd gasps]
917003 Because there is something even more important to celebrate. There are two ponies who have watched over us night and day for as long as we can remember. We will no longer commemorate their battle or their reunion. Instead, we will take this day to celebrate how much they mean to all of us. From this day forward, today will be known as the Festival of the Two Sisters!
917000 [crowd cheers]
917019 We don't know what to say.
917007 [giggles] A brand new holiday? You're my kind of princess!
917003 I'm just glad we pulled it off.
917008 About that... We just wanted to say we're real sorry.
91700d You did tell us you'd changed.
91700e As your friends, we should've trusted you.
91700c Next time you say you're not gonna freak out, we'll believe you.
917003 Good. Because I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of things I'll need my best friends' help with.
917007 Whee-hee!
9170d4 Aah!
917000 [thud]
917012 [laughing]
9170db You know, it really does seem like you just might be ready for whatever comes next, your Majesty. [chewing]
917485 Sooooo did you find what you're looking for?
9174cf Once again, I've found success where you all find failure. I have located what I sought, and tomorrow I will set out to retrieve it. When I return, Equestria will finally be ours for the taking.
91726d Hmph!
91719c Oh, stop pouting.
917485 You knew you couldn't stay that buff. You had to return all the life force to those Earth ponies so Grogar doesn't suspect anything.
91726d I don't have to like it.
917485 Well, I don't like that we worked so hard to destroy their party and they still pulled it off. But you don't see me complaining!
91719c Our goal wasn't to destroy. It was to distract. And now we have exactly what we need.
91726d And no time to waste. We have to master the Bell before Grogar returns.
91719c We've managed to stay one step ahead of everypony so far.
917485 You know, it really was super easy to get all those Earth ponies and Pegasi and unicorns to turn on each other.
91719c It was, wasn't it? Now that is something to think about...
917000 [credits]
91850a [hissing]
91800e Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. Antoine believes what he eats is his business. Do other predators feel that way, too?
918000 [animals chattering]
91800e Would anyprey like to respond? Muriel, does it bother you when Antoine tries to eat you? Just because you're on opposite ends of the food chain doesn't mean you can't work—
91850b [trumpets]
91800e Huh? It doesn't mean you can't...
9182f9 [roars]
91800e [clears throat, strained] It doesn't mean you can't work togeth—
91850c [growls, chomps]
91800e Oh! [sighs] I'm sorry, but the more you distract everyone, the longer this will take.
918040 [angry chittering]
91800e I am listening to you. But if you really want to be heard, you should join our predator/prey support group. Then you can talk to everyone here. You could teach all these hungry predators the delights of a carrot-based cuisine. Sorry, everyone. I think somebunny just wants a little attention. Now, since we all need to get along, what if all predators promise to only eat vegetables while staying at the sanctuary?
9182f9 [low growl]
918000 [animals chattering]
91850c [whines]
91800e Oh, Sandra, you can do it.

91812b It might look like chaos, but Fluttershy makes it work, even with Angel running around.
918047 Ohhhh. Perhaps I can help those two get along before something here can go terribly wrong.
918000 [theme song]

91812b Zecora found this little guy and brought him to my office. But I thought he might do better at the sanctuary.
918000 [poof]
918040 [coughing]
918047 Bringing him here seemed the right thing to do. I've never seen geckos breathe smoke though. Have you?
91800e Ooh. I certainly haven't.
91812b I thought we could take a look at his diet. Plus, it's about time for me to give all the animals here a checkup.
91800e That's a wonderful idea.
918000 [lizard chirping]
91800e If we really want to know what's going on, we need to make sure the problem isn't your food.
918000 [stomach growls]
91800e I wouldn't worry too much. It's probably just something he's been eating. Oh. [grunts] Um, is there anything else we can do for you?
918047 Ahhh. Seeing what you two do, the real question is – can I help you?
918040 [blows raspberry]
91800e You mean me and Angel?
918047 Mm-hmm.
91800e Oh, he's fine! We're fine! I... I just don't always have time to indulge him. But we're best friends!
918047 Even the best of friends need help from time to time. Come visit me in my hut, should you change your mind.
91800e Okay, thanks! But Angel and I are great!
91812b Oh, goodness, Fluttershy. Is this the list of what you do every day? [chuckles] How do you find time for anything else?
91800e Between here and teaching at the school, I'm not sure I do. You're gonna love it here, little gecko.
918000 [lizard chirps]
91800e What is it? Not fluffy enough?
918000 [lizard chirps]
91800e Oh, sorry. We need to see if your food is causing your issue.
918000 [lizard purring]
91800e Huh? Hmm. Not now, Angel.
91850a [hisses]
91800e There's snake treats made to look like chocolate chip cookies.
91850a [chews, gulps]
91800e They're vegan. Pinkie Pie made a whole jar of them. They're all yours if you promise. No more trying to eat Muriel the baby elephant. [gasps] No, Angel. I have too much to do.
9183aa [coughing]
91812b Oh, careful, girl. That neck is still pretty sore.
91800e Don't forget to shift your weight, Scout!
91850d [snoring]
91812b [sighs] What does she want?
91800e Her neck is feeling better, but a massage every day for the next week wouldn't hurt. I'll add it to my list.
91812b [laughs] Fluttershy, I've said it before, but I'll say it again. This place would be a... zoo without you! [laughs, snorts]
918000 [thunk!]
91800e Angel!
918000 [beat]
91800e Listen to you for once? Just what exactly is that supposed to mean?!
918040 [chitters]
91800e Come back! I-I meant tell me, not—! [groans]
91812b Well, whatever it is, you're the only one he can tell about it. Little fella just wants you all to himself.
91800e Unfortunately, that's not an option.
91812b Aw, he's not causing any real trouble.
918000 [crash!]
91812b Aah!
918000 [birds chirping]
91812b Other than that, possibly.
918000 [crash!]
91850b [trumpets]
91812b Or that. I'll just stop talking.
918000 [zip!]
91800e [groans] I'll take care of it. I hope this is important, Angel. I barely made a dent in my to-do list for today.
918000 [door opens]
91800e Concentrated carrot extract? That's for reviving energy-sapped herbivores. Are you feeling rundown?
918040 [chitters]
91800e You just like the taste?! Ugh! Angel, that extract is in short supply! What's gotten into you? Every day this week, you've been causing trouble when I have work to do!
918040 [chitters]
91800e Of course I know you can't talk to anypony else. But that's not my fault. I have responsibilities!
918040 [growls]
91800e You're right. We can't go on like this. I guess we do need to see Zecora for help.
918047 No need to sit and silently stew. Tell each other what's bothering you.
91800e He's so impatient, even when he knows I have work to do.
918000 [beat]
91800e Well, that's not true. We talk all the time.
918000 [beat]
91800e Of course talking at the sanctuary counts. That's where I am when I don't have a class to teach.
918000 [beat]
91800e What do you mean that's the problem?
918000 [beat]
91800e You feel like I'm the only pony you can talk to, and all I do is ignore you? Well, I feel like you don't care about my responsibilities.
918000 [beat]
91800e [laughs nervously] Um, as you can see, we're kind of at an impasse.
918047 Ahhh, such luck, your coming here indeed. Behold, the antidote you need.
91800e Is this what you meant by "help us"?
918047 When trouble brews between you two, turning sister against brother, true understanding is what's due. Each must come to know the other. There's no time to waste. Go directly home. But you both must taste when you're finally alone.
91800e Not yet, Angel. Zecora told us to take it together when we got home.
918000 [beat]
91800e Hmm. I suppose we could dust off the old picnic blanket. It'll be just like old times. We'll drink the potion and settle in for a nice tea party. I can barely remember the last time we did that. I've been so busy at the sanctuary. Though I really need to keep an eye on Zecora's gecko, and I haven't finished any of today's chores. If I don't, the animals won't get the care they need. Ohh. Maybe we should just save the potion until af— Angel! Zecora said to go home first!
918000 [pop!]
918000 [splash]
918040 [gulps, burps]
91800e I know she said we have to take it together, so... I guess I have to.
918000 [pop!]
91800e [gulping, belches] I wonder what it's gonna doooo—
918000 [magic sounds]
918040 —whooooaaaa!
918000 [thud]
918040 Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hang on, hold up! Am I a pony? Why am I a pony?!
91800e [high-pitched scream]
918040 Question. Did we switch bodies?
918000 [thud]
918040 Whoa! Gah! Guh! Whoooaaa-whoa-whoa! Seriously? I'm a pony? La-la-la-la! Talking is so cool. Do you think this is what Zecora meant to happen?
918000 [beat]
918040 How are you gonna do your chores?! Really? That's what you're worried about?
918000 [beat]
918040 [scoffs] Well, maybe I don't want to switch back. I've only been able to talk to you since we met. And now I can talk to anypony I want! [to Rose] Roses are red, violets are blue! You sell flowers... [to Daisy] ...and so do you!
918000 [zip!]
918040 [to "Cultivar"] Rubber baby buggy bumpers! [to Cream Puff] Rubber baby buggy bumpers!
91810c [crying]
918040 Toy boat, toy boat, toy bo— Aah! Aw, come on!
918000 [beat]
918040 I am so too listening! Quit being so bossy because—! [gasps, sniffs] Are there carrots around here?
918000 [beat]
918040 You think Zecora gave us the wrong potion, so you're gonna go to her hut in the forest and get something to switch us back?
918000 [beat]
918040 All by yourself? You really don't know what it's like being a bunny.
918000 [beat]
918040 Good luck with that! I'm gonna go find those carrots!
918000 [thudding]
918040 I need to finish your chores? [laughs] I don't work for you. And caring about other animals is a "you" thing.
918000 [warbling]
918040 [gasps] The Stare?! You can still do that? Ugh! No fair making me do your bidding against my will!
918000 [warbling]
918040 All right! I'll go do your lame chores while you go see Zecora.
918000 [splash]
9183aa [slurping]
918040 Anypony know where that useless list of Fluttershy's chores is?
91812b Hey, Fluttershy! I was starting to wonder if you'd make it back.
918040 Fluttershy! Oh! Yeah! Uh, that's me! Definitely Fluttershy! A hundred percent!
918000 [beat]
91812b Uh, okay.
918040 See how shy I am? Hmm? I talk to animals, I want to marry Discord—
91812b Your list is over there.
918040 [sarcastically] Oh, yeah. There's my good old list of chores that I will absolutely not rush through because I definitely do not have better things to do. Well, well, well. Remember me?
918005 [shudders] I hope the gem tart stall is still there again. I could use a snack!
918003 You nearly bought every tart they had last time, Spike. I can't imagine they wouldn't show up when there's a great customer like you. Oh, hi, Angel. What's going on?
918000 [beat]
918003 Do you know what he's trying to say?
918005 Nope.
918003 Sorry, Angel. You should probably find Fluttershy. If I see her, I'll let her know you're looking for her.
91800e [panting]
918000 [tense music]
91850c [stressed barking, whines]
918040 And we're gonna keep at it until you start to develop a taste for it!
91850c [whines]
918040 Uh... [reading] "Check Muriel's trunk."
91850b [exhales, deep inhale]
918000 [keys jingling]
918000 [thunk]
918040 Eh, seems fine to me. As long as we don't need those keys.
91850b [whines]
918040 Anyway, let's see. [reading] "Massage Clementine's neck."
9183aa [coughing]
918000 [hard thuds]
9183aa [coughing]
918040 [reading] "Get Scout to switch legs"?
91850d [snoring]
918040 Eh, probably best not to wake him. Did the thing with the thing, yadda-yadda-yadda, animals, animals, animals... All that's left is... "Monitor Zecora's gecko until bedtime"?
918000 [beat]
918040 All right, dude. How about we do bedtime now?
918000 [lizard chirps]
918040 Yeah, eating makes me tired, too. Which reminds me. There's some carrot extract with my name on it. Okay! Let's get you fed and off to dreamland! What do you eat anyway?
918000 [lizard chirps]
918040 [to Antoine] What do you say, snake? Can you find something else to eat if I borrow those cookies for my friend here?
918000 [jar clinks]
918000 [lizard gulping, burps]
918040 Eh, I'm sure that's normal. There you go. Problem solved. I don't see what's so hard about this job. Fluttershy is such a whiner.
91850a [hissing]
918000 [thud]
918000 [bushes rustling]
91800e [panting, squeals]
918000 [eagle squawking]
918000 [thud]
91800e [panting]
918047 Quite a day, my fuzzy friend. Did things work out for you in the end?
918000 [beat]
918047 I'm... sorry, dear bunny, that things seem so grave. But I don't understand when you sign and wave. A single link to all the world. Only one in all the land. How special she must be to you, the one who understands. Perhaps if you explain what you wanted to some pony who understood. If you truly felt heard and valued, all would return to good. And if you were to both apologize, having learned this little lesson, I imagine that might bring an end to the friendship therapy session.
918000 [door creaking]
918040 [grunting]
91812b Fluttershy? Do you mind helping me look for Muriel the baby elephant?
918040 Oh, she's having dinner with Antoine.
91812b Antoine the python?!
918040 It was on the list. "Remember – Antoine wants to have Muriel over for dinner."
91812b Not OVER for dinner! He wants to have her FOR dinner!
918040 Wait. What?!
91850b [muffled trumpeting]
91812b Bad snake! Open your mouth this instant, mister!
918000 [mice squeaking]
91850c [growls, barks, whines, barks]
9182f9 [growls]
918000 [crack!]
91850d [crying]
9183aa [coughs]
918000 [fire whooshes]
91812b Aah! What is going on?! You did all the chores on your list! Huh?! Didn't you?!
918040 Well, technically I did 'em, kind of. But more technically, it's not my list.
91812b You wrote it!
918040 Did I though?
91812b What's gotten into you?!
918040 You do not want to know.
918000 [thud]
91812b Huh? Angel?
918040 What's wrong with her— h-him?! What happened?
91812b He's exhausted!
918040 [whimpers]
91812b Fluttershy! I need a jar of concentrated carrot extract! Stat!
918040 Ah! It's locked in the supply room!
91812b Where are your keys?!
918040 Uhhh...
91850b [muffled trumpeting]
918040 Any ideas how to get the keys out of the elephant that's inside the snake?
918000 [animals grunt]
918040 Okay, point taken. And I totally deserve it. I did not provide you with the care that Fluttershy would. But now you know what it's like not to get the level of attention to which you've become accustomed!
91850c [grunts]
918040 The point is... Fluttershy is trapped in my bunny body. If we don't help her, maybe none of us will get her attention! I get that you don't want to help me. But don't you want to help her?
918000 [animals chattering]
91850c [grunts]
918040 Here goes nothin'.
918000 [creaking]
91850a [hissing]

918000 [pop!]
91850b [trumpets]
918000 [thud]
918040 [gasps] Now we just need to get those keys out of there.
91850a [hisses loudly]
91850b [trumpets]
918000 [keys jingling]
918040 [laughs] Nice one, snake. I guess Fluttershy was right. Predators and prey can work together.
918040 [grunting, panting] This place is so... much... work!
91812b Oh, I know. I have no clue how you do it all. But we are so grateful.
918040 I can't believe she does this every day! I just wish I could tell her myself.
91812b What?
918040 [whimpers] You're awake!
918000 [beat]
918040 It was so hard getting to Zecora's hut? And impossible getting back? You can't believe I survive like this?
918000 [beat]
918040 Well, I can't believe you work here every day! These animals are crazy! No wonder you don't have time for me.
918000 [beat]
918040 My life is hard? No, your life is hard!
918000 [beat]
918040 You never appreciated me? No! I never appreciated you!
918000 [beat]
918040 You're sorry? I'm sorry, too! Come here, you little bunny who's a pony who's a bunny! Ooh!
918000 [magic sounds]
91800e Oh, my goodness! I'm back! I'm a pony again!
918000 [smack!]
91800e Oh, Angel. I promise to always make time for you from now on.
918000 [beat]
91800e What do you mean maybe I won't have to?
918000 [beat]
91800e You want to do what?!
91800e "And that's when I realized Fluttershy doesn't have to be the only one I talk to. I can come here and talk to all of you. And now that I know how much work goes into this place, I suppose I can kinda sorta help out every now and then."
918000 [squirrels chitter]
91850c [grunts]
91800e Oh, Angel. That is so sweet. But now that I know what you go through every day, I understand why your time with me is so important. I promise to always make time for you.
918000 [animals grunt, applaud]
91812b Turns out your friend here doesn't have a problem at all. He isn't a gecko. He's a fire lizard.
918000 [fire whooshes]
91812b I forgot that before they get their flame, it's hard to tell them apart. [laughs]
918047 I'm glad to discover where the source of it lies, or the fire that he breathes would be quite the surprise.
91812b Speaking of surprises, can you please never do that again?!

91900d [singsong] Oh, Spiiiike? Are you in here? Hellooooo?
919000 [beat]
91900d Spike?
919005 Mm-hmm...
91900d Oh, there you are! I was starting to think you weren't here. I realize this is last-minute, but I've decided on a quick trip to the gem cave! I am on an urgent mission to find some faceted iridescence for my new design, and I can't think of anypony I'd rather have along than my favorite basket holder/bodyguard Spike.
919000 [beat]
91900d Spike?
919000 [beat]
91900d Spiiiike?
919000 [beat]
91900d [echoing] SPIKE!
919000 [thud]
919005 What? Oh. Hey, Rarity.
91900d Honestly, Spike. It's almost as if you haven't been listening.
919005 [blows fire] Oh, uh... of course I was. But just to be sure, could you say it all again?
91900d [sighs] I was saying that I had planned on visiting the gem cave—
919005 Oh, no! Is that the time?!
91900d Aah!
919005 [panting]
91900d Of course, you're right. This is a bit of a late start, and those gems won't pick themselves.
919005 Uh-huh.
919000 [doors open]
91900d But the real question is which basket do you want to hold? The smaller one, right? [laughs]
919005 Oh, right. Sorry, Rarity. Can I take a rain check on... What was that again?
919000 [beat]
91900d The... gem cave?
919005 Right. Sounds great. But I need to get to the post office before noon.
91900d [laughs] All right, very funny. Obviously, you'll get the bigger basket, and I shall—
919000 [beat]
91900d Spike? Hello?
919000 [theme song]
919000 [gem clinking]
91900d I don't understand. For as long as we've known each other, Spike has never turned down an opportunity to join me here. It's his favorite place.
919000 [gem clinking]
91900d Ideally you catch the gems, dear. And for a trip to the post office of all places?
919000 [gem clinking]
91900d Maybe you should move closer? And why would Spike need to go to the post office at all? He sends mail by breathing! Breathing, darling! Breath mail!
919000 [gems clinking]
91900d Honestly, Applejack, if you're going to fill in, you could make an attempt to hold the basket the way Spike would.
919008 [spits] And how's that?
91900d Well, for one thing, Spike knows how to keep things quiet so as not to waken the bats.
919000 [bats squeaking]
91900d And he usually pulls me closely so no gem ever touches the ground!
919008 [gasps] Rarity, Spike's been followin' you closely since he got to Ponyville. And in case you hadn't noticed... [echoing] I AIN'T SPIKE!
919000 [bats squeaking]
919043 [yelping]
91900d Actually, Applejack, I had noticed!
919000 [doors open]
919000 [books thudding]
919003 Um, hi, Rarity. What's up?
91900d Ugh! Besides my mane? Well, that is a question for Spike.
919003 Oh. Well, Spike isn't here. I think he's at the post office.
919000 [scraping sounds]
91900d Again?! What is it with Spike and the post office?!
919003 Rarity, what's going on?
91900d Spike declined my invitation to the gem cave, and I intend to find out why.
919003 Hmm. That doesn't sound like Spike. Did you two have some sort of fight?
91900d A fight? Goodness, Twilight. What in Equestria would we fight about?
919003 I've had arguments with friends before, and they can put a real strain on friendships.
91900d Well, certainly. But I think I'd remember if we had an argument.
919003 Maybe you didn't realize it? Do you think you could've done something that unintentionally hurt his feelings?
91900d Well, if I didn't realize what I did, how would I know what I have done when I did it? [brays] I wonder if that's it. It certainly would explain his behavior. I must apologize!
919003 For what?
91900d Oh, pfft. That's hardly the point. Poor Spikey-Wikey! This calls for a grand gesture!
919003 Okay. Good talk. [groans]
919000 [door opens]
91900d [grunting]
919000 [scraping]
919000 [clang!]
919374 Wow! That's a big crate of stuff you're mailing.
91900d I'm not mailing it.
919374 Then why are you pushing it into the post office?
91900d Oh. I didn't realize griffons worked at the Ponyville Post Office.
919374 Oh! [giggles] No, I don't work here exactly. I'm the official mail carrier of Griffonstone. Gabby Griffon. Nice to meet ya!
919000 [rattling]
91900d [sighs] Yes, well, uh, these things aren't for sending. They're for apologizing to Spike.
919374 Oh! Spike was just here. He went to go make us a—
91900d That's perfect! It'll give me a chance to practice. Uh, you stand there and tell me if I hit the right apologetic notes.
919374 What are you apologizing for?
91900d Darling, I don't see why that matters.
919000 [clattering]
919000 [gems clinking]
919000 [thud]
919000 [ka-chunk!]
919000 [deep boom]
919000 [music playing]
91900d [overdramatically] And that is why I simply cannot bear the thought of having hurt you! And even though I don't know what it is that I did, I want you to know that it doesn't matter! Because I am prepared to do anything to make it right! [sobs] And scene.
919000 [ka-chunk!]
919374 [muffled speech]
91900d Oh, sorry, dear. Here.
919374 I said, that sure sounds genuine.
91900d Well, of course it sounds genuine! It is genuine!
919000 [thud]
919005 Rarity? What are you doing?
91900d Obviously, I'm working on my apology to you, Spike. I don't know how I could be more genuine. I mean— [gasps] Spike!
919000 [zip!]
919000 [ka-chunk!]
919000 [deep boom]
919000 [music playing]
91900d [overdramatically] Oh, Spike! I am so sorry! Please forgive me!
919000 [crash!]
919000 [cat yowls]
91900d [overdramatically] You have to forgive me! I don't know what I did or why you're mad at me! Just please say you forgive me! [wailing] Pleeeeeeeease!
919005 Of course I forgive you. But, uh, what are you apologizing for?
919000 [ka-chunk!]
91900d Why does everypony keep harping on that—?! Wait. Don't you know?
919005 No, I'm not mad at you about anything.
91900d B-But... But I don't understand. If you're not upset with me, why in Equestria would you refuse to go to the gem cave?
919005 Uh, because I had other plans?
919000 [clattering]
919374 With me!
91900d [gasps]
91900d I don't understand. You two know each other?
919005 Gabby and I are sort of pen pals.
919374 Yeah! There was this whole thing where I pretended to get a cutie mark because griffons don't get cutie marks, so Princess Twilight had Spike send a bunch of letters off to Griffonstone about the first griffon ever to get a cutie mark! Which I didn't really have.
919005 Gabby wrote back explaining things, and after that we just started writing back and forth.
919374 Turns out we have a lot in common! We both come from cultures that don't have the friendliest of reputations.
919005 [slurps] And we're both in the message-sending business!
919374 Uh-huh!
91950e [chomp, gulp]
919374 I sure wish I could send scrolls with my breath!
91950e [laughing]
91900d [forced laugh] Yes... Now I understand why you didn't come to the gem cave. Having a friend in town is a rare treat. Well, since you're busy today, maybe we can do something tomorrow. Fabric shopping? I know how you love to pick out the colors.
919005 Uh, actually, now that there's a griffon at Twilight's school, Gabby's here all the time.
919374 Grampa Gruff asks for a lot of updates about how Gallus is doing. [sighs] Speaking of which, I better get going.
919005 I'll fly with you.
91900d Well, all right. You two fly along. I'm sure Spike and I can do something some other—
919000 [beat]
91900d ...time?
91900d I cannot decide which shade of purple is the most royal! And there's the pink! How will I ever choose?!
91900c [grunting] Too bad Spike's not here. I bet he could help you narrow it down.
91900d He is a good sounding board, isn't he?
919000 [muffled thud]
919000 [curtains close]
919000 [montage music]
919000 [camera clicks]
919000 [bits clinking]
919000 [door opens]
919000 [door opens]
919000 [thud]
919000 [slurping]
919000 [sewing machine whirring]
91900d [sighs] Could you bring the pincushion a little closer, dear? I suppose now that Spike's always so busy with Gabby, I'm just now realizing how much his presence has meant to me over the years.
919000 [beat]
91900d Even closer, darling. I don't want to prick you. I have to admit everything feels a bit "less than" without him. Too close!
919000 [thud]
91900d Oh, darling, it's no use. Thank you for trying. I'm just accustomed to the help of a small, highly attentive dragon.
91900e Maybe you should let Spike know how grateful you are for everything he's done for you.
919005 [snoring] Aah!
91900d Oh, I am sorry, Spike. I didn't mean to frighten you.
919005 Rarity? What are you doing here?
91900d Well, I realize it's late. Or rather, early. But I have a surprise, and I just couldn't wait to share it. The Great Gem Crevasse of the Crystal Mountains!
919000 [click]
919005 Whoa!
91900d It is only accessible once a year, and I thought a little day trip would make a wonderful thank you for all the help you've given me over the years.
919005 Oh. But I'm supposed to meet Gabby today for her rounds.
91900d I see. Well, there's always next year.
919000 [door opens]
919005 You know what? I'll just write her a note.
91900d Are you sure?
919005 Absolutely.
919000 [train chugging]
919000 [train hisses]
919000 [gems clinking]
919005 Wow. Rarity, you weren't kidding. The Gem Crevasse was amazing! I'll be snacking on these for a week.
91900d What did I tell you?
919374 Hey, Spike!
919005 Gabby! You won't believe where I went today!
919374 Actually, I think I will. I got your scroll. The Great Gem Crevasse sounds a lot better than doing my rounds.
919005 Mm-hmm!
919000 [gems clinking]
919374 Whoa! It was definitely better! I gotta get back to Griffonstone, but you have to tell me all about the Crevasse tomorrow!
919005 Absolutely! [grunts] Thanks again, Rarity. What a great day.
919374 Okay! Start from the beginning, because I want to hear everything!
919005 Well, to get to the Crevasse, you have to climb across a rope bridge because the air's too thin to fly!
919374 That is amazing! Then what?!
919000 [thud]
919374 Whoa!
919005 Sorry, Rarity!
91900d Oh, no apology necessary, Spike. In fact, I was just looking for you.
919005 You were? Why?
91900d Because I just acquired... these!
919005 Passes to Power Ponypalooza?! For today?!
91900d Mm-hmm! I know we just went to the Crevasse, but I feel I've barely scratched the surface of expressing my gratitude for all you do.
919005 Uh... of course I want to go, but that'll be two days in a row we haven't hung out.
919374 Nah! Are you kidding? It's Power Ponypalooza! You have to go! And now you'll have two things to tell me about!
919005 Okay! Come on, Rarity! Let's go!
919005 Whew! Are my claws sore.
91900d Indeed. I had no idea how much walking there is at a Power Pony convention!
919005 [grunting] Aww. I know I told Gabby we'd hang out tomorrow, but I might need the whole day to rest.
91900d Whoo. I know what you mean. Perhaps you could, uh, just send her another note.
91912f [grunting]
919005 [chuckles] I think maybe you're right.
91900d Honestly, I might need to spend tomorrow putting my hooves up as well. [laughs]
919000 [door opens]
919000 [knock on door]
919000 [door opens]
91900d I hadn't counted on Power Ponypalooza being quite so draining, but I thought we might spend the day recuperating together.
919005 No way! Ogres & Oubliettes?!
91900d Well, I know how much you enjoy it. And this seemed like the perfect opportunity for you to teach me the game.
919000 [door opens]
919374 [echoing] Spike? I got your note! I figured I'd come by before my rounds with a bowl of energizing turnip soup.
91912f [laughter fading in]
91900d Can Princess Shmarity use her Shield of the Coiffure to defend herself from the purveyor of poor color coordination?
919005 Oh, she can try... Success! Shmarity's shield holds against the Green-Eyed Monster's attack! And then—!
919374 Spike?
919005 Oh, hi, Gabby. We were just—
919374 Your scroll said you were too tired to do anything today. But I guess you were just too tired to do anything with me.
919005 No-no-no-no! That's not true! I can come with you on your rounds right now!
919374 I don't think so, Spike. Maybe I'll just handle the rounds on my own from now on.
919000 [thermos clinking]
91900d Oooh! Princess Shmarity uses her Prismatic Beam to change that poor monster's color to a more pleasing shade of purple!
91900d What do you think, Spike? Solids or prints?
919005 [sighs] Prints, I guess. You already have a lot of solid colors.
91900d Oh, you are so right. Prints it is! So nice to have you back, Spike.
919000 [cash register rings]
91900d Although I hope you're able to reconcile with Gabby.
919005 I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.
919000 [montage music]
91900d I quite enjoyed our day together today, Spike.
919005 Yeah...
919003 Hi, Spike.
919005 Uh-huh...
919003 Hmmm. I've never seen Spike this sad before. Do you know what happened?
91900d [clears throat] Yes, well, perhaps he's still just tired from Power Ponypalooza.
919003 I don't think that's it.
91900d I... suppose... it's possible it could have something to do with... [coughs] Gabby not wanting to spend time with him anymore.
919003 What? I thought the two of them were hanging out all the time.
91900d They were! Honestly, it took everything I had to convince him to spend any time with me at all! But between crystal gem crevasses, Power Pony conventions, and a marathon game of O&O, I managed to get some time in.
919003 It sounds like you made sure he didn't have any time to spend with Gabby at all.
91900d What?! Pfft! I most certainly did not!
919000 [beat]
91900d Well, I... suppose I may have monopolized him a teeny bit. [sighs] I'd just grown so used to having Spikey-Wikey around, I wasn't prepared for how much I'd miss him when he wasn't.
919003 Friendships change, but just because Spike made a new friend doesn't mean he stops being yours.
91900d I know, but now I have to share him! Which I suppose I'll have to get used to. [gasps] Right after I fix the mess I've made!
919003 Good talk.
919374 [sighs]
919000 [door opens]
919000 [music playing]
919374 Rarity? Is all this stuff for Spike again? Wouldn't it be easier to just give it to him? And why are you even here?
91900d I am here to apologize. Actually, more to confess. And all of this stuff isn't for Spike. It's the evidence against me!
919374 Evidence? For what?
91900d For my acts of utter selfishness!
919374 I don't understand.
91900d These are items I used to lure Spike into spending as much time with me as possible!
919374 They are? You did?
919005 Rarity? What are you doing?
91900d Well, obviously I'm apologizing to Gabby so the two of you can renew your friendship, Spike. Now please, even if you can't forgive me, you simply must forgive— [gasps] Spike?! Oh. I actually owe you an apology, too.
919374 You apologize a lot.
91900d I wish I didn't need to, but the more time you two spent together, the more I missed my time with Spike, and the more I used every means at my disposal to get it back. I am truly sorry.
919005 You really miss spending time with me?
91900d Oh, of course!
919374 I have to say, after not hanging out with you, I understand why. You're kinda awesome! And I know what it's like to miss that now, too.
919005 So, do you think maybe we could start hanging out again?
919374 Absolutely.
919005 I don't suppose you'd like some company on your rounds right now?
919374 I sure would!
91900d Wonderful! I can't tell you how pleased I am that the two of you have— [laughs] ...reconciled.
919000 [pickaxe clinking]
91900d [whispering] I suppose Twilight is right. Friendships do change.
919000 [gem shattering]
919000 [bats squeaking]
91900d [whispering] Of course Spike and I will always be friends, and I can get used to sharing him.
919007 [panicked yelping, whispering] Sorry! I just didn't want to drop another one and wake the bats.
91900d [whispering] Darling. Catching the gems is what the basket is for.
919005 [whispering] Wow. You two need to be a lot quieter.
91900d Spike! How wonderful to see you!
919005 Yeah. Gabby and I had a great day, but I'll always still want my Rarity time.
919000 [pickaxe clinking]
919000 [gem shattering]
919007 Ohhhh! So that's how it works!
919000 [wings flapping]
91950f [scream]
919000 [credits]
92027c I think you really spruce up the office, Ms. Philodendron. [gasps] Oh! I'm gonna call you Phyllis! [baby talk] Don't you look good, Phyllis!
920000 [knock on door]
92027c [baby talk] Come in!
920000 [door opens]
92027c [clears throat] I mean, uh, come in!
920005 Uh, were you just talking to someone?
92027c No! Why? [nervous laugh]
920003 Starlight, I have something very important to discuss with you.
92027c If this is about leaving early yesterday, I didn't have any students on my schedule, and Trixie was having a magical emergency, which actually turned out to be nothing—
920003 [giggles] It's not anything like that.
920005 [clears throat, reading] "Twilight Sparkle, the Princess of Friendship, in light of her impending ascension to the throne of Equestria and in anticipation of her many duties and responsibilities forthwith, does hereby intend to make good on her previous offer to you, Starlight Glimmer, of replacing her as headmare of the School of Friendship!"
920003 I want you to take over the school when I move to Canterlot.
92027c I know! It's just so... amazing! I'm a little... Do you think I'm really up for it? Of course you do. I've covered for you every time you've had to run off and save Equestria, but... I mean... Yes. Of course! Thank you! [squeals]
920000 [thud]
920003 [straining] You're welcome. And I can't think of anypony who'd be better for the job.
92027c I'm a little nervous. And excited. I'm mostly just nervous.
920003 I understand. Of course I'll have a lot of important responsibilities as ruler of Equestria, but I'll always be available to help whenever you need.
920005 [gags, belches]
920000 [poof!]
920005 Are you supposed to be at a royal etiquette lesson with Celestia and Luna right now?
920003 Right! [sighs] Can't underestimate the important responsibility of royal napkin placement.
920000 [teleportation zap]
92027c Wow. I mean, no biggie. Right, Phyllis? I've totally got this.
920000 [shatter!]
92027c [nervous laugh]
920000 [theme song]
920037 You know I'm nothing but proud that you've been officially offered the position of headmare...
92027c Thanks...?
920037 ...but I can't help wondering if it's gonna cut into our social schedule.
92027c What do you mean?
920037 Take now, for example. Instead of heading to the delightful lunch I had planned, we're striding with determination toward what I can only assume is Twilight's office.
92027c Obviously our lunch is super important, but so is taking over the school. And the only pony who's really run the School of Friendship is the Princess of Friendship. And I'm worried about doing it all alone, so I want to get as much advice from Twilight as I can while she's still here.
920037 But Twilight's never really done anything alone. She always has her friends.
92027c But that just gave me an idea! Thanks, Trixie! You can give good advice when you don't mean to.
920037 Uh, thanks? Are we still doing lunch?
920000 [door opens]
920003 Getting royal place settings just right is a lot harder than it looks.
92027c Okay... Uh, I know how busy you are, but I wanted to talk to you about running the school because, honestly, I was a bit worried about taking it over all on my own. But I just realized you never did it alone.
920003 Having a friend help out is pretty great.
920000 [magic humming]
92027c Exactly! So, what do you think about me hiring a vice headmare to help run things?
920003 I trust you to run the school any way you want. And if that means hiring a vice headmare, I think it's a great idea.
92027c Really?
920003 Like you said, I've always had ponies around to help. And don't worry. You can always call on me to—
920005 Uh, Twilight? Rarity says you were supposed to be at the boutique five minutes ago for your second fitting for the coronation gown.
920003 Ugh. How many fittings are there gonna be?
920005 A lot?
920003 Anyway, good luck finding your vice headmare. I know you'll pick the right pony for the job.
920000 [teleportation zap]
920037 Wow. I heard the whole thing. And all I can say is I am humbled.
92027c Uh, why?
920037 I hadn't ever considered it, but hearing you say it out loud made me realize what a great and powerful vice headmare I'll be! Plus, we get to work and socialize at the same time!
92027c Uh, well, sure, that would be fun, but I can't just give you the job.
920037 Oh, oh, no, of course not. I imagine there's a lengthy "process" to go through before you inevitably hire the "best pony" for the position. Wink.
92027c Exactly. I'll probably interview several ponies.
920037 Of course. "Several". Wink.
92027c Why do you keep saying "wink"?
920037 I'm not saying "wink". Wink.
92027c [nervous laugh]
92027c I'm glad you all decided to be a part of the search for the School of Friendship's vice headmare.
9202ed Honestly, if you're looking for somepony to fund-raise, I can bring in enough bits to have several buildings named after me.
92027c Well, that's not the primary responsibility of the vice headmare. But anypony is welcome to apply. I think the selection process I've come up with is pretty special.
920037 [whispering] Albeit unnecessary. Wink!
92027c [clears throat] Since you all have to prove you have what it takes to be vice headmare, I've designed the interview in three stages. Each stage will test a different skill the vice headmare needs. Only those who do well will move through the stages until finally the best candidate rises to the top! So, without further ado, it's time for stage one – substituting for the teachers!
920510 [excited murmuring]
920037 Once the students get a sample of my great and powerful instruction, they might not want to go back to the regular faculty.
92027c [groans]
920189 Wow, that seam is so straight! You really learned how to sew from mending apple sacks on the farm?
920026 Eeyup!
9202ed Obviously, loyalty is the foundation of friendship and trust. But nothing gets more loyalty than a big stack of bits! This book on business will teach you all how to earn your own. Chapter one – Equity...

920000 [sounds of awe, cheering]
920037 In the Pre-Equestia Era, year thirteen twenty-two, Abraxius the Bold did... [muttering] ...ooh, a bunch of boring stuff... [muttering] ...for a really long time. Okay, I know history is important, but I never learned any of it, and look how I turned out.
920000 [students groaning, yawning]
920184 [snoring]
920000 [students snoring]
920037 [whispering] Wink! [snoring]
92027c [groans]
92027c Okay, Phyllis. Obviously those three are moving on. But what about the rest? Mm-hmm. I think we're in agreement on this one. [sighs] I know what you're gonna say. But it would be so much fun to have my vice headmare be a friend. She just needs a little more hoof-holding than some of the others, but it could still work out, right?
920000 [door opens]
920037 Starlight, I've given this a lot of thought. And even though I still believe naps are a valid use of class time, you'll be the one running the school. So if you say no naps, then no naps! And I know I can be a little stubborn and not the best listener, but I just can't wait for us to tackle this job as a team. Two great and powerful friends taking on the world! And I know you still have to go through all this "interview" stuff – wink! – but I just had to tell you how excited I am!
920000 [door closes]
92027c See? I told you it could work. [groans]
92027c All right, remaining vice headmare candidates. Welcome to stage two! All of you are here because you performed well – or well enough – to face your next challenge – parent/teacher conferences! The vice headmare will need to be a master communicator, and I can't think of a better test of that than meeting with our students and their parents or guardians.
920061 I eagerly look forward to sharing my love of science with both progeny and progenitors!
9202a6 Indeed. An orchestra is made up of different parts, and good communication is the key to harmony.
920026 Eeyup.
920037 A lifetime on stage has taught me that good communication is essential to holding your audience's attention, which is why Trixie is also known as a great and powerful communicator!
9202a6 Life at the School of Friendship is like a song, and although she started out singing her part pianissimo, Ocellus is now soloing fortissimo!
920511 That's good, right?
9202a6 [nervous laugh] Indeed.
920061 The science curriculum at this school is somewhat lacking, but Yona has taken to the subject like a yak to smashing! If fostered, I believe she could easily blaze a trail and expand our understanding of science itself!
920512 Yaks best! Yaks best! Yaks best!
920037 Gallus is a fantastic student. He's even taught me a thing or two about napping.
92029e [yawns] Is that why you're putting me to sleep?
920037 Um, excuse me?
92029e I don't know why I have to come to these things.
920037 Well, most parents or guardians want to be involved in our students' lives. Maybe we should find a different representative from Griffonstone to be Gallus' guardian.
92029e Oh, that'd be great. If you find one, [echoing] let me know!
92046d I'm so confused. You're saying Silverstream is exuberant?
920026 Eeyup.
92046d And enthusiastic?
920026 Uh, eeyup.
92046d But aren't those the same? And are they good? I mean, you could be trying to tell me she's unfocused, but then you might just be explaining that you appreciate her high energy.
920026 Eh, nope. Uh, eeyup. Uh... mmmaybe?
92046d There seems to be a lot of nuance here, and I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you're saying. So what are you saying?
920026 Uh...
92029e Gallus doesn't need to know I'm proud of him! And he certainly doesn't need me trekking all the way to Ponyville!
920037 Good! Because you're no longer welcome!
92029e Ohhhh! Well, fine with me!
92027c Trixie, what happened?!
920037 I'm not sure. But we'll have one less conference to worry about next semester.
920000 [smack!]
92027c I really appreciate your honesty, Big Mac, and you're right. Parents expect a lot of detailed communication when it comes to their kids. And if you aren't comfortable with that, vice headmare probably isn't the job for you.
920026 Yeah, nope.
920000 [door opens]
920037 Starlight, I know why you wanted to see me, and you don't have to worry.
92027c Uh, good.
920037 It's thoughtful that you'd want to check in on me after my shocking confrontation with Grampa Gruff. But never fear. I shall recover.
92027c Trixie, that's not exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. You can't get into a shouting match with parents or guardians. For the final stage of the interview process, you'll each have to put together a field trip. And if you really do want the job, I need yours to be exceptional. Because if I had to pick a vice headmare right now, it wouldn't be you.
920037 Oh, I see what you're doing! Obviously you're not going to give the job to somepony else, but you want to see my best. Well, message received! Wink.
92027c [groans] Trixie, I—
920037 The Great and Powerful Trixie is about to pull out all the stops! I hope you're ready for the most exceptional field trip to ever grace this school!
920000 [poof!]
92027c Is it wrong for me to think she might actually pull it off?
920000 [beat]
92027c [groans] Don't answer that.
920184 [yawns]
92027c Not looking forward to the performance?
920184 I know Octavia loves music, but a field trip to a classical music performance isn't my idea of an exciting time.
920000 [dubstep cello]
920000 [ponies cheering]
920184 Okay! I take it back!
920061 When I heard we'd be arranging field trips, I knew right away I wanted to take you all to my lab. I can think of no better trip than one through the quantum field! I am referring to time travel! I've been working on a temporal transportation device!
920186 A chair?
920061 And three... four... five... Congratulations! You are now five seconds into the future! You see, we are all already time travelers! Hmm? Who's next?
920000 [beat]
920186 Uhhh, now what?
920061 Oh. I actually hadn't thought that much beyond this.
920186 Ugh.
920000 [poof!]
920037 [coughs, clears throat] Ponies and other students! Welcome to the greatest and most powerful field trip of your lives!
920187 Where Yona and friends going?
920037 I am thrilled you asked. Because today we're not doing a normal, old, boring field trip where you go somewhere.
920187 So... not field trip.
920037 Au contraire. I could have easily taken you to Froggy Bottom Bogg. But we don't need to leave the comfort of the classroom for our field trip. I can bring the field trip to us!
920000 [teleportation zap]
920000 [crash!]
920000 [students gasp]
920000 [crack!]
920000 [electric sounds]
920000 [flash bees buzzing]
92027c Trixie, what did you do?!
920037 Well, I found the perfect little patch of bog to teleport into the school. I guess I just didn't consider the possibility that a hive of flash bees might have nested there.
920000 [zap!]
920000 [flash bees buzzing]
920000 [students yelling]
920037 [yelping] Who told you bees to nest in my patch of field trip bog?!
920000 [poofing]
920000 [electric sounds]
920000 [students yelling]
92027c Trixie, go with the students! I'll handle this!
920037 I was only trying to give them an exceptional field trip experience! Which you have to admit I did.
920000 [flash bees buzzing]
92032e Aah!
92027c We'll talk about it later!
920000 [magic sounds]
920000 [boom!]
920037 Um, Starlight?
920000 [clattering]
920037 Hey, there. So, um, they're gone?
92027c [bitterly] Yes.
920037 Nice! Teamwork, am I right?
92027c Are you kidding? I don't know what team you're on, but it isn't mine. This was a disaster. It was dangerous.
920037 I think the words you're looking for are "great and powerful".
92027c It wasn't even acceptable! You went from not taking it seriously to blowing things so out of proportion you put everycreature in danger! And I wanted to work with a friend so much, I ignored the fact that you would never be right for the job!
920037 I'm confused. What are you saying?
92027c I'm saying you'll never be vice headmare!
920037 But... But I thought you created the position for me.
92027c Why would you think that?! I created the position because I need help! But I can't think of any way that you would ever help me!
920037 Twilight's friends always helped her.
92027c Oh-ho. That's because Twilight's friends are competent! They care about what they are doing! And they know how to do it!
920037 Well, I guess I won't take up any more of your time, Headmare Starlight.
920000 [thud]
920003 Starlight? I just thought I'd check in to see how the search for a vice headmare was going.
920000 [magic sounds]
92027c A lot better now.
920003 Okay...
92027c I really wanted it to be a friend, so I ended up pushing aside some pretty big signs that it wasn't gonna work out.
920003 Not everypony is right for every job, but everypony has something to contribute. The trick is figuring out what.
92027c What if you and your friend can't figure it out?
920003 If you have a job to do, you have to decide what's best and be upfront and honest, even if that means you can't work with a friend on it.
92027c So, I guess that means talking to them at the beginning instead of stringing them along until you get so frustrated you totally lose it and say a bunch of really awful things?
920003 Pretty much.
92027c [sighs]
920000 [knock on door]
92027c Trixie? I know you're in there.
920037 Well, you're wrong!
920000 [clatter!]
920037 [coughing]
92027c I'm sorry for all those things I said. I just really wanted it to work out, even though I knew it probably wouldn't. I should have said something sooner.
920037 Obviously we can't have what we want, because I'm terrible at everything and could never help you with anything!
92027c You aren't terrible. And you have a lot of great qualities. Maybe not vice headmare qualities, but great and powerful friend qualities.
920000 [door opens]
92027c Well, you really stand by the ponies you care about. Gallus even said nocreature's ever stuck up for him the way you did with Grampa Gruff. It would have been nice to run the school together, but not everypony is right for every job.
920037 I know how you take your responsibilities seriously. And maybe I should've known I wasn't exactly a perfect fit.
92027c If it makes you feel any better, nopony was.
920037 What do you mean?
92027c Well, Dr Hooves has decided to go back to his experiments, and Octavia is worried the responsibilities of vice headmare will take too much time away from her music. Maybe getting a vice headmare was a bad idea.
920037 Starlight, obviously you'd like some help, and hiring a vice headmare is a great idea.
92027c But who could it be?
920037 Well, you need somepony who's responsible like you and detail-oriented like Twilight. And... smart, obviously. It is a school after all.
92027c It would be nice if I got along with them, since having it be a friend can't work out.
920037 Maybe it can.
920000 [poof!]
920315 ...And I knew as soon as I read Trixie's scroll that it was the exact right thing for me to do.
92027c But what about being Flurry Heart's Crystaller?
920315 Well, honestly, now that Flurry Heart's a little older, there really isn't much for me to do outside of the occasional tradition or festival. And working at a school is what I always thought I'd do. I mean, if you'll have me.
92027c Are you kidding?! You're hired!
920037 I had a feeling this would work out.
92027c Oh, Trixie, thank you so much.
920037 Between being insightful when I want to be and giving good advice when I don't mean to, I suppose I can be a pretty good friend.
92027c More than that, actually. You really did give good advice. And you helped me talk through the problem of finding the right pony for the job. And we know you care about the students.
920037 Trixie the Great and Powerful Advice Giver, Problem Talk-Through-er, and Student Care-About-er! Eh, I think I'll go with "friend".
92027c "Friend" is perfect. But there's a position here at the school you might be right for, too. What would you say to being the School of Friendship's new student counselor?
920037 I'd say this office needs a bit of redecorating. Potted plants scream desperation.
920000 [thud]
92027c Phyllis, no!
920000 [credits]
921000 [knock on door]
921000 [door opens]
92100e Oh! I just stopped by to thank you for letting me borrow your Daring Do books. I love them!
92100c Wait 'til you get to Daring Do and the Riddle of the Sphinx!
92100e This is actually my second time through! I read them all! From Daring Do and the Sapphire Statue to Daring Do and the Fallen Idol!
92100c Fallen Idol? That's not in the series.
92100e Oh. It just came out last week. Maybe that's why you haven't heard of it?
92100c No way Daring Do's biggest fan – me – would miss a book coming out! Besides, A. K. Yearling always sends me a copy.
92100e Well, I'm happy to let you borrow mine until yours arrives.
92100c [reading] "The true story of the thieving fraud known as Daring Do"?! What?! Why would A. K. Yearling write that about herself?!
92100e Oh. It looks like she didn't. This book says it's by Groom Q. Q. Martingale.
92100c Who?
92100e I guess he's a new writer.
92100c A bad one. [reading] "The only thing worse than Daring Do's destruction of temples is her cruelty to the mild-mannered Dr Caballeron"?!
92100e It was written from his point of view. I figured it was an artistic choice.
92100c More like a disaster! Listen! [reading] "Daring Do isn't just a fictional character from over-the-top adventure stories. I've met her, and she is a real, live pony!" That's supposed to be a secret! [grunts] We're the only ones who know Daring Do is really A. K. Yearling in disguise. But if other ponies read this book, how long will it take them to figure that out?! We have to go warn her! Fluttershy!
92100e Hm? Oh. Sorry.
921000 [theme song]
92100c A. K. Yearling is signing all her books at the bookstore today. We can warn her about what's going on.
92100e Don't you think you should read Martingale's book first? Just to hear both sides of the story?
92100c Uh, why? The only true thing in that pack of lies is that Daring Do is real.
92100e There's also a lot of insight into Dr Caballeron's life choices. Did you know he's actually a history professor and amateur bird watcher?
92100c Are you serious right now? A random writer trashes our friend and exposes her secret, and you want to talk about birds?!
92100e [whispers] Also spider cruelty.
92100c What?!
92100e You have to admit Daring Do wrecks a lot of spider webs in her adventures.
92100c In order to save precious artifacts from the bad guy, who you seem to have forgotten is Dr Caballeron! Are you sure you read the same series I did?
921000 [door opens]
92100c Well, at least A. K. Yearling's true fans know Martingale's book is bogus.
92100e I'm not sure those are all fans.
921000 [slam!]
92110d Why didn't your books say Daring Do was real? This changes everything!
92110e And why do you only write about her good side? Is she bribing you?
92110d On page five-thirty-one, it says that Daring Do kicks puppies!
9213a8 She does?!
921356 What?! No! Look, are any of you here for my actual book signing?
921000 [ponies muttering negatively]
92110e Uh-uh. Frankly, I don't even know how you can call it fiction if it's all real. [scoffs] You're as much a fake as Daring Do!
921000 [ponies agreeing]
92100c I... guess we're a little late to warn you about the new book, huh?
921356 [sighs] I always feared that someday everypony would learn Daring Do was real.
92100e But why? Aren't you proud of your adventures?
921356 Of course, but I'm not in it for the fame. The stories just seemed too good to keep to myself. I wish I knew who this Martingale author was and why he's determined to ruin my character. And me.
92100e Maybe we can ask him.
92100c No way! He's doing a signing across the street?!
921356 You'd better go without me. I can't risk the chance Martingale might recognize me as Daring Do.
921000 [indistinct chatter]
92100e Oops. Um, sorry. E-Excuse us.
92100c [gasps] That's not Martingale! It's Dr Caballeron in disguise! Now it all makes sense! Daring Do's archnemesis created a fake author self so he can write books that make him sound like a hero! Who does that?!
92100e Uh, A. K. Yearling?
92100c This is totally different. [to Dr Caballeron] Well, well, well! Up to your old tricks again, huh? Just like in Somnambula! Spreading lies to make Daring Do look bad!
92100e Would you sign our book?
921513 I am just a simple author telling it like it is. Who should I make it out to?
92100e Fluttershy. With two "T"'s.
92100c [groans] We know who you really are! And unless you want us to tell all of them, you'd better answer some questions!
921513 I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. [chuckles]
92100f Awwww...
921513 But please take a free copy of my book on your way out.
92100f [cheering]
92100c We aren't gonna let you get away with this, Caballeron!
921513 Get away with what? I am merely telling my side of the story.
92100c You mean lying!
921513 You think everything in A. K. Yearling's books are true? In Daring Do and the Quetzal's Quest, she states that the Fangthorn Flowers are red when in fact they are blue!
92100e It's true. They are.
92100c [scoffs] That sounds like more of an editor's mistake.
921513 Still, if that is wrong, is it not possible that other, bigger things are, too? Take a look. It's in my book.
92100c But I don't have to take your word for it! C'mon, Fluttershy!
921513 [sighs dramatically]
92100e Is something wrong?
921513 It is terrible being misunderstood. It is true in the past I have not been as nice to Daring Do as I should. But I have my reasons!
92100e Want to talk about what happened?
921513 My team and I were only ever interested in researching artifacts and taking them to our museum where...
921513 [narrating] ...other ponies could study them. But Daring Do always seemed to get there first with her own plans. I offered to team up with her, but she refused. She had her own ideas of where the treasures belonged.
92100e Daring Do did have a lot of artifacts on her shelves at home. But didn't you try to sell them to the highest bidder?
921513 Only because I had to.
921513 [narrating] Since Daring Do kept taking our artifacts, our museum closed. We were desperate for money to keep it open.
921151 [roars]
92100e She does destroy a lot of ancient sites. Not to mention the homes of the animals that live there.
921513 And I felt it was my duty to tell the world. Thank you for listening and understanding, Miss...
92100e Fluttershy. Two "T"'s.
921202 And I am Dr Caballeron. "Martingale" is merely a nom de plume to build my brand. You know, my team could use an insightful Pegasus like you, Fluttershy. Have you ever thought of being... an adventurer?
92100e Who, me?
921000 [door opens]
92100c Finally! What took you so long?
92100e I decided to find out which author is really telling the truth, so I joined Dr C's Tenochtitlan expedition!
92100c Say whaaaaaaat?!
9213a8 So Daring Do doesn't kick puppies?
921356 That was one time! Accidentally!
921000 [door opens]
92100c [panting] A. K.! You have to help me! Groom Q. Q. Martingale is really Dr Caballeron, and he has Fluttershy! The book thing was his new plan to ruin Daring Do's reputation, and he's trying to make my friend a criminal! They're off to Tenochtitlan right now!
921356 He must be after the Truth Talisman of Tonatiuh! It requires the wings of a Pegasus to retrieve it!
92100c That's gotta be why Caballeron tricked Fluttershy into joining his gang!
921356 Then it's up to us to stop him!
921000 [cloak flaps]
9213a8 Whooooaaaa!
921000 [crunch]
921202 Watch where you put your hooves, everypony. We do not want to disturb the fragile jungle ecosystem.
92100e Oh, that's so thoughtful.
921202 Yes, unlike Daring Do, who slashes plants aside with her cruel machete.
92100e Thank you.
921000 [crunch!]
921202 Fool! Don't you know that's poison?!
921000 [beat]
921202 I... don't want you to get hurt, my friend. [nervous chuckle]
921514 But I'm hungry.
92100e Oh! I can help with that! Here!
921202 You are... willing to share?
92100e Of course! That's part of the fun of having an adventure with friends!
921000 [munching and sipping]
921000 [bushes rustle]
921000 [jaguar roars]
921000 [lynx yowls]
921000 [cheetah growls]
921515 [gasp]
921000 [white cat yowls]
921000 [screech!]
921202 Fluttershy! Run! These ferocious beasts want to eat us for dinner!
92100e That's a common misconception. Have you ever tried just talking to them?
921202 That's crazy! You are on your own!
921516 She's a goner.
921517 I can't watch!
921000 [jungle cats purring]
92100e We're very sorry for coming into your territory. We're just passing through.
921202 How did you do that?
92100e Everycreature likes to be listened to. You just need to take the time to understand them.
921202 You are more talented than I realized.
92100e Thanks. I'm having the best time with you all!
92100c Fluttershy must be having the worst time with Caballeron's goons!
92114e We need to catch up to them before they reach the Truth Talisman!
92100c Why? What's so special about it?
92114e It has the power to make the pony holding it tell the truth. But Caballeron only wants it because it's made of solid gold. He'll melt it down and use it to get rich.
92100c So if this Talisman is so important, why didn't you already save it? You said only a Pegasus can get it, right?
92114e Yes, but the temple traps are far too dangerous to face without a map. And maybe even with one.
92100c [gulps]
921517 Boss, how about we take the shortcut?
921202 How about you be quiet?!
921000 [beat]
921202 I-I mean... no, thank you, Biff. Let's just follow the map.
921517 Aww. I'm supposed to be Dr C's second-in-command. But he never listens to me.
92100e Well, keep trying. I believe in you.
921202 At last! Now we simply have to wait for the sun to reach its highest point, and our path will be revealed.
921000 [fly-ders buzzing]
92100e Withers. Don't. Move.
921000 [zip!]
921000 [flute sounds]
921516 [cheers]
92114e There they are! We can catch them before they enter the temple!
921000 [vines snap]
92114e [yelps]
92100c [gasps]
92114e Get back, Rainbow Dash! It's Ahuizotl!
921000 [vines snap]
92100c [grunts]
921151 [laughs evilly] Daring Do, my old nemesis. You may have outsmarted my jungle cats, but you cannot escape me!
92100c [grunts] We didn't see any cats! We're just here to rescue Fluttershy!
921151 Hmmm... It must be a coincidence that only a Pegasus can retrieve Tonatiuh's treasure, and there are two of you here.
921000 [slam!]
921000 [zip!]
921151 [roars]
921000 [grinding]
921000 [magic sounds]
921000 [rumbling]
921202 Quickly! Before the sun moves and it closes!
921000 [rumbling]
921000 [thud]
92100c Phew! That was cutting it close.
92114e And without a map, we'll have to guess which way to go.
921000 [rumbling]
921000 [shimmering]
921202 [overdramatically] Oh, no! I knew the Truth Talisman could not be moved by magic, but I never realized we'd have to fly to retrieve it! Our journey has been for nothing!
92100e Don't be upset. I can get it.
921202 Oh, Fluttershy, you are too kind. But I could never ask that of you. It might be dangerous!
92100e I want to do it! For all of you, my new friends. And to protect a historical treasure!
921000 [rumbling]
92100e [screaming] Whoa!
921517 [grunts] Give me a hoof here!
921516 [grunting]
921000 [cracking]
921000 [thud!]
92100e [yelping] Aah!
921000 [lava bubbling]
921000 [rumbling]
921516 We did it!
921514 You're safe!
92100e Thanks, everypony.
92114e Give us the Talisman, Caballeron!
92100c We're not taking no for an answer!
92100e Wait! You don't understand! My friends are researchers! They only want to study the Talisman and keep it safe in a museum! Right, Dr C?
921202 Uhhh... no.
92100e [gasps] But... But you said—
92114e Now that he's holding Tonatiuh's Talisman, he has to tell the truth!
92100c Admit it, Caballeron! You're only pretending to like Fluttershy because she has the wings you needed to steal the Truth Talisman! Isn't that right?!
921202 No! I admit that was the original reason, but my henchponies and I have come to value your friendship and kindness.
921000 [beat]
92100c Didn't see that coming.
921000 [rumbling]
921151 [growls]
92100c Or that!
921151 More intruders? And you dare to steal Tonatiuh's Talisman?! Guardian-goyles, attack!
921000 [shimmering]
921000 [guardian-goyles growl]
921151 [laughs evilly]
921000 [thud!]
921000 [guardian-goyle roars]
921000 [guardian-goyles growling]
921202 Fluttershy! Can't you ask them to stop like the jungle cats?
92100e Um, excuse me? Uh, guardian-goyles?
921000 [guardian-goyle growls]
92114e It's no good! They're only stone and magic, not alive! I encountered some like this in Marapore!
921202 Ah, yes. I seem to recall similar creations in Flankladesh.
92100c So? How do you get rid of them?!
921000 [chomp!]
92114e I know they don't like bright light!
92100e There's none of that in here.
92114e Not yet! Caballeron! Do you still have the Diamond of Lapis Lux?
921202 Yes! I-I mean... [straining] Yes! I-I mean—! [growls] How did you know I stole it?!
92114e Lucky guess. Hold it high!
921000 [guardian-goyles growl]
921000 [cracking]
92100e Wow! You two make a great team!
92100c Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about that.
92114e Feel later! Now it's time to escape!
921000 [thudding]
921517 If we want to get out of here, we're all gonna have to work together.
921202 That's... actually a good idea.
92100e See? Told you he'd listen.
92114e A truce until we escape? How can we trust you?
921202 I cannot lie. Now, all together!
92104d [grunting]
921000 [thud!]
921151 [humming] Aah! You again! [growls] If I wanted to play games, I would get out my pinochle deck!
92114e This way!
921000 [whooshing]
92114e Rainbow Dash!
92100c I'm gonna need the deluxe spa package after this adventure. That doesn't leave this temple!
921514 That's it! I'm quitting the henchpony business to finally follow my dreams of becoming an opera star!
921000 [beat]
921514 Uh... maybe you should hold this.
921000 [slam!]
921151 You cannot hide in there forever! It's a dead end! [laughs evilly, grunting]
92114e Ahuizotl won't give up until he catches us.
921151 [grunts]
92100e [gasps] I think our problem is the solution.
92100c Uh, did you forget there's a monster out there that wants to crush us?
92100e But why? Nopony ever asked Ahuizotl what his side of the story is. He must have a reason for being so upset.
92100c Or maybe he's just the bad guy! Do I need to remind you he's tried to squash Daring Do like a hundred times?!
921000 [slam!]
921202 And me as well. I was so scared, I had to change my ascot. Aah! Curse this truth teller!
92100e Understanding begins with listening.
921151 [growls] Prepared to meet your doom?
92100e Um, not really. Just here to ask – why are you chasing us, Mr Ahuizotl?
921151 Well... the thing is, I'm in charge of protecting this jungle. If another artifact goes missing on my watch, I'm going to be in so much trouble with the other guardian creatures.
92100e Awww. That sounds like a lot of responsibility.
921151 [stammers] It is! And those two have taken so many relics from my land, my job is on the line! So... maybe I am a little violent and ferocious. Can you blame me? [blows nose]
92114e The only reason I've been taking the artifacts is because I thought I was protecting them.
921202 I was stealing them to get rich. But I never realized you had a noble cause. I thought you were just being a monster.
921151 [sighs] I get that a lot.
92100c Maybe there is something to this whole listening-to-everypony thing.
92100e It doesn't always mean they're telling the truth, but everycreature deserves kindness.
921151 True. And because you returned the Talisman and took the time to understand me, I will let you all go.
921000 [rumbling]
921151 On one condition! You swear to never steal artifacts from the Tenochtitlan Basin again!
921518 I promise.
92114e I'll even write that in my next book.
921202 Your next book? You mean you're actually A. K. Yearling?
92114e Don't tell anypony!
921202 That gives me an idea.
92100c Hey, what's going on? I thought your first co-written novel would bring out a ton of fans.
921356 We've been upstaged by a new author.
921151 And so, the noble Ahuizotl bravely toiled day and night to protect the jungle's precious artifacts...
921000 [credits]
92200a I can't believe we're goin' to the Appleloosa County Fair!
922066 Animal shows, carnival rides...
922065 And all kinds of food on a stick! [slurps]
922000 [thud]
922066 Speaking of food, did you pack snacks for the train?
922065 For there and back.
92200a And our train tickets are all set.
922066 And I've got our whole itinerary planned!
92200a Are you sure you're not Twilight's sister?
92207f [laugh]
922065 Weeks of planning has all come down to this. All we have to do now is wait for our chaperone to get here.
922081 Mm-hmm!
922000 [pause]
92200a So when's Rainbow Dash comin'?
922065 I thought you were gonna ask Applejack.
92200a [to Sweetie Belle] I don't suppose you asked Rarity?
922066 You mean we spent all this time planning a trip, and none of us asked anypony to take us?!
922065 In our defense, every other part of the trip was planned really well.
922000 [clatter]
922000 [theme song]
922066 We really did think of everything except finding somepony to take us, and the fair is only today!
92200d I'm sorry, darlings, but I can't possibly go to Appleloosa. I promised to deliver a new design to Fancy Pants for his Monocle and Top Hat Appreciation Society soiree.
922066 Can't you finish it tomorrow?
922000 [smack!]
92200d Well, I could. But you'll learn as you get older how important it is to keep your promises, especially when running a business.
922066 Maybe we should just go by ourselves?
92200d What?! Oh, my dear, no! Appleloosa is far too long a train ride for young foals without accompaniment. You could end up in the wrong place entirely. Why don't you see if Rainbow Dash is free?
92200c Sorry, but I just heard from Spitfire that a whole bunch of storm clouds got loose from the cloud factory, and she needs every Wonderbolt to help bust 'em.
922065 Aw, come on, Rainbow Dash! They won't miss one pony! And we really want to go to the fair! Apparently we're too young to go alone.
92200c Well, duh. Young ponies like you could get lost and never find your way back. But I still can't go. Being a Wonderbolt isn't just about showing off. It's also a responsibility. You'll understand when you get older. I'm sure you'll find somepony else to take you.
922008 I wish I could, sugarcube. But Big Mac's not feelin' well today.
92200a Awww. But Big Mac's old enough to take care of himself, and we'd all have so much fun together.
922008 Sometimes takin' care of somepony is more important than havin' fun. Speakin' of which, don't you even think about tryin' to go without a grown pony there to take care of you. You could end up in hot water or worse.
92200a We know.
922065 The fair could be over before we find somepony to take us.
92200a But then we thought of you, since the fair will be full of all sorts of animals and creatures.
92200e I'm sorry, but Twilight has an important magical research project, and she's asked for my help.
922066 I guess that means Twilight's busy, too?
922003 I'm afraid I am. Star Swirl sent me this enchanted flower, and it isn't doing well. If I figure out its magical properties, maybe we can save it.
922065 So that's a "no" on going with us to the fair?
92200a We've already asked Applejack, Rainbow Dash, and Rarity, and none of them can come.
922066 And everypony made it clear we're too young to go on our own.
922003 Oh, definitely. You could take the wrong train or miss your stop...
92200e Or get lost in a strange town and end up in a dangerous situation with nopony to help you.
922080 We know!
922003 I know it's hard, but sometimes you just can't do what you want.
922065 I'm pretty sure if you wanted to go to the fair, you could.
922003 Sure, grown-ups can do a lot of things that foals can't. But there's plenty we can't do either. Like right now, I can't find a single reference to this flower!
92200e None of the birds or insects I've talked to have heard of it either.
922003 I wonder if there's anything in Shadetail Evergreen's Tome of Flora and Fauna?
92200e That book's pretty out of date, but it might be worth a try.
922003 I think there's a copy in the library filed under "Discontinued But Still Potentially Useful Ancient Texts". Unless I put it under "Hokum With a Slight Chance of Practical Applications".
92200a I guess this flower is the most interestin' thing we're gonna see today.
922065 Unless you count watching Twilight struggle to remember how she organizes her books.
922066 I bet every pony in Equestria is in Appleloosa right now.
92200a Every pony but us.
922065 I wish we didn't have to wait to grow up.
922000 [magic sounds]
92200a I wish it would happen all at once. Then we'd know everything we need to get to the fair and back with no problem.
922000 [louder magic sounds]
922066 I just wish we were as old as our sisters. Then nopony could tell us what to do, and we'd be able to take care of ourselves.
922000 [even louder magic sounds]
922065 Hey, Sweetie Belle, why's your face all lit up?
922000 [high-pitched humming]
922000 [zap!]
922000 [whooshing]
922080 [whimpering]
922000 [whooshing stops]
922080 [groan]
92200a [gasps]
922066 [gasps]
922065 [gasps]
922000 [shatter!]
922080 [gasp]
922065 Do you know what this means?
922080 We can go to the fair! [laugh]
922065 [laughing]
92200a I hope you brought the tickets. We've gotta hurry if we're going to make the train.
922066 I think we'll be fine. Check out how fast we're going! Grown-up legs are strong!
922065 You're not kidding!
922000 [rattling]
922065 I don't know how much of this my scooter can take!
922000 [ponies gasp]
92200a And nopony yelled at us to slow down even once! Being a grown-up is great!
922000 [pocketwatch ticking]
922080 [panting]
922000 [train whistle blows]
922080 [sigh]
922066 We made it!
92200a Of course we did! We're grown-up ponies now! We can do anything! And all those worries Twilight and the others had don't apply anymore. Because we're big! And bein' big is all it takes!
922080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
922080 Woke up this morning feeling tired and small
922080 But look at us now - we must be ninety feet tall
922080 Don't have to worry 'bout making mistakes
922080 Because being big is all it takes
922065 [Scootaloo]
922065 A tiny twist of fate brought on this big change
922065 Give me room, gotta zoom, I've got plans to arrange
922065 Can do what I want, be it run, trot, or traipse
922065 'Cause being big is all it takes
922080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
922080 Being big isn't just a size
922080 At bedtime we don't even have to close our eyes
922080 We're in control now, for goodness' sake
922080 'Cause being big is all it takes
922066 [Sweetie Belle]
922066 Leaving behind the little pony you've known
922066 Stepping out, growing up, making moves of my own
922066 You can't tell me no, there's no place I can't go
922066 Mountains, cities, jungles, or lakes
922066 'Cause being big is all it takes
922080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
922080 Being big isn't just a size
922080 We'll tell you our opinion 'cause we're oh, so wise
922080 We're in control now, for goodness' sake
922080 'Cause being big is all it takes
922065 [Scootaloo]
922065 I can eat all the snacks 'cause that's for me to decide
92200a [Apple Bloom]
92200a We know how it all works, even what we ain't tried
922066 [Sweetie Belle]
922066 Facts don't matter now 'cause it's not what we know
922066 We can win any argument with...
922080 [Cutie Mark Crusaders]
922080 Because I say so! -
922080 Can't stop us now, don't try to stand in our way
922080 We're awake, gonna take all we can from today
922080 Once we had to listen, now you'll hear what we say
922080 Everything is always okay
922080 'Cause being big is all it taaaaaakes
922080 All it takes!
922000 [train chugging]
922000 [brakes hiss]
922000 [train chugging]
922065 [stomach rumbles] I think I ate too many snacks.
922066 Uh, this doesn't look like Appleloosa.
9224c3 That's because it isn't...
922000 [creaking]
92200a You all heard that, right?
922066 Uh, hello? [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] Do you think we got on the wrong train?
922065 I thought trains just took you where you wanted to go.
9224c3 [laughing]
922080 [scream]
9224c3 Sorry, I don't mean to laugh. But you three must not travel much. This is Hayseed Junction. The train to Appleloosa isn't for a few hours. Or you could set off on hoof. It's treacherous and confusing! Unfit for the young or timid! But you three are grown-ups. You'll be fine. I'll write down some directions.
922066 Maybe we should wait for the train.
922065 And miss the fair?!
922066 We already ended up in the wrong place, which is exactly what we were warned about. And what if we can't follow the directions?
92200a Come on. We didn't come all this way for nothin'. Besides, I've been through a swamp as a young pony. As a grown-up, it'll be a snap.
922065 Grown-ups always know the way!
922066 Because being big is all it takes!
9224c3 [laughs maniacally, hacks, inhales] Sorry. I've got kind of a throat thing.
922000 [montage music]
922000 [splash]
922000 [bufogren croaks]
922065 Aah!
922000 [splash]
922000 [vines stretch, recoil]
922000 [bubbling]
922000 [splashing]
922065 Sweetie Belle, are you sure this is the right way?
922000 [wind whistling]
922000 [branches creaking]
922065 Sweetie Belle?
922000 [bushes rustle]
922066 Scootaloo?
922065 Aah!
922000 [thud]
922065 Don't do that!
92200a Girls?
922000 [snap!]
922000 [thud]
92200a Maybe we should head back to the station.
922066 I'm not sure we can. I think we're lost.
922065 Just like Twilight and the others said!
922519 Well, where were you when I was feeding and caring for him?!
922000 [bushes rustle]
92251a [screams] Wild swamp ponies!
92251b Hmph!
922066 We're not wild swamp ponies. We're just grown-ups.
922065 And we are definitely not lost.
922519 Okay. But that swamp is pretty confusing if you're not from around here. I'm Spur, and this is Biscuit.
922000 [rattling]
92200a I'm Apple Bloom. Nice to meet you. But, uh, we're not confused. We're just... explorin' new ways to Appleloosa.
92251a Hey, that's where we're going!
922519 No, it isn't!
922066 Uh, which is it?
922519 Biscuit thinks he can just take Bloofy here to the fair.
92251a Why not? It's just up the road. And Bloofy's my pet, too.
922519 Since when?! Bloofy's never even seen a crowd! Which you'd know if you ever took care of him!
92251a Did you ever think meeting all those ponies might be good for him?
92251e [chittering]
92200a He seems okay meetin' us.
92251a See? They're grown-ups, and they get it. Bloofy should totally come to the fair with me, right?
922519 Y'all don't really think that, do ya?
922066 Um... Hold on. Us grown-ups need to confer. [to Apple Bloom and Scootaloo] What do you girls think?
922065 If they go to the fair, we can tag along!
92200a And Spur probably should share Bloofy. I mean, that's somethin' a grown-up would say, right?
922066 As grown-up ponies, we think you should share Bloofy and let Biscuit take him to the fair.
92251a That is some quality grown-up advice!
92251e [chittering]
922519 But Bloofy's never been around anything that exciting. What if something goes wrong?
92200a We're headed to the fair, too. Since we're such great advice givers, feel free to ask us for more.
922000 [ponies chattering]
922000 [horseshoe clangs]
922000 [splash!]
922000 [ponies laughing]
922066 [laughs] It's everything I thought it'd be!
92251e [squealing]
92251f Well, my goodness, what an interesting critter! You should enter him in the animal showcase. You'd be sure to win "Most Interesting Creature"!
92251a Animals showcase? That's exactly what we should do!
922519 That seems like a bad idea. What do you grown-ups think?
922080 [laugh]
922000 [thunk!]
922000 [bell rings]
922000 [ponies cheer]
922080 [laugh]
922066 Whoo-hoo! Whoo-whoo!
922000 [splat]
922519 What happened to being able to ask your advice?! You ran off the second we got here!
922065 [gulps]
92200a Where's Biscuit and Bloofy?
922519 That's why I came to find you.
922000 [fanfare]
922000 [ponies chattering]
922519 It's one thing to bring Bloofy to the fair, but it's another to stick him in a showcase!
92251a What's the big deal?
922066 You are supposed to be sharing him.
922065 Yeah, I'm with Biscuit. The showcase looks like fun.
922519 Sorry if I think taking care of Bloofy is more important than having fun!
92251e [shrieking]
92251a Bloofy's just excited. He probably just wants to get out.
92251e [chitters, sniffs]
92200a Are you sure you're not just upset you have to share him? What if you took a little break?
922519 You mean, like, leave?
922066 If sharing him is too hard, that might be the best thing. Take our word for it. We are grown-ups.
92200a I don't know what Spur's so worried about. Bloofy and Biscuit are havin' fun.
922065 Yeah. What could go wrong?
92251e [chittering]
922000 [ponies cheering]
92251e [squealing]
922000 [whooshing]
922065 Me and my big grown-up mouth.
922000 [ponies screaming]
922000 [whooshing]
92200a Do you think this qualifies as gettin' into a dangerous situation with no grown pony to help us?
922000 [cow moos]
922066 I think we're the grown ponies that need to be helping today!
922065 Bloofy! Treats, treats, treats! Who wants a treat?
922000 [whooshing continues]
922000 [teleportation zap]
92251a What do we do now?!
922080 Run!
922000 [train whistle blows]
92200e I hope you're right about the girls coming here.
922003 Well, once we read Shadetail Evergreen's warning that the flower grants wishes, it wasn't a stretch to think they wished themselves to the fair. It's all they were talking about.
92200e Or maybe, since we told them they were too young to come, they wished to become grown-ups, then came here and caused some kind of trouble that led to a town-wide panic!
922000 [distant screaming]
922003 Yeah. Or that.
92200a Twilight! Fluttershy! Thank goodness! I know you're not gonna believe it, but it's me, Apple Bloom!
922065 And I'm Scootaloo! We kinda got turned into grown-ups!
922066 And we thought we could take the train here, since we were old enough, but we ended up in the wrong place, just like you said we would!
92200a And got lost!
922065 Just like you said we would!
92200a Then we met these foals who led us to the fair, and we tried to give them some grown-up-style advice, but it turned their pet into a tornado that might destroy the whole town!
922000 [whooshing]
92200e Goodness! A Whirling Mungtooth! They are very rare and just the cutest little things when they're not excited.
922000 [crash!]
92200e This one's excited.
922065 How do we calm him down?
92200e When they're young, a Mungtooth forms a tight bond with its caretaker. They're the only ones who can get them to stop spinning.
92251a Spur's the one who really took care of Bloofy. We have to find her!
922003 You all go look for Spur. Fluttershy and I will do our best to keep everypony here safe.
922000 [teleportation zap]
922000 [ewe bleats]
922519 That's Bloofy?!
922000 [teleportation zap]
92251a I'm so sorry, Spur. You knew what was best for him all along.
92200a And even though we seem like grown-ups, you were way more responsible than us.
922519 What do you mean, "seem" like grown-ups?
922066 Uh, we don't have time to explain. Right now we have to stop this, and you're the only one who can do it.
922519 How?
92200e I'll show you. He mostly just needs to see you.
922519 Hey there, Bloofy-boo. It's okay.
922000 [whooshing stops]
92251e [squeals, chitters]
922519 How did you know what to do?
92200e After years of experience with animals, I've picked up a few things.
922519 Well, one thing's for sure. Bloofy definitely earned the "Most Interesting Creature" prize.
92251a I'm sorry I didn't listen to you.
92200a We all are.
922519 I guess grown-ups aren't always perfect.
922003 They sure aren't, but young foals pretending to be grown-ups are even less so.
922519 What do you mean?
922003 There's only one petal left. But I think the three of you know what to wish for. And I'm pretty sure Star Swirl won't mind.
922080 We wish we were foals again.
922000 [magic sounds]
92251a Hold on! You three are actually younger than us?!
922066 The flower turned us into grown-ups, so we figured we could do whatever we wanted. But I guess that's not exactly true.
92200a We did everything real grown-ups told us not to and caused all kinds of trouble.
922065 And things could have been a lot worse. I guess we were pretty selfish.
922003 I'm glad you learned something. That's what growing up is. Which is why you probably shouldn't skip any of it.
922066 I know we didn't make the best impression, but we sure would like to visit you and Bloofy some day.
922519 I guess that'd be okay, on one condition. You get a real grown-up to bring you.
922080 Deal!
92204d [laughing]
922000 [credits]
923005 [sighs] I just wanted everything to be perfect. I mean, this was a big deal. But when Discord insists on being involved...
9230db Regardless of what Spike might say, that little dragon begged me to help. And let me tell you, he can cause plenty of chaos all on his purple lonesome.
92302a I pride myself on baking under pressure, but I just... Oh, dear...
92300a You'd think we would be used to stuff like this in Ponyville.
923066 I still have nightmares.
923005 It seemed simple when it started...
923005 [gasps] It's beautiful!
923026 Eeyup. Nope!
923005 I'm not gonna eat it!
923000 [poof!]
9230db Eat what? What is it! I want to see!
923026 Nope!
9230db Why not?!
923005 Because you have a big mouth.
9230db Me?! I keep tons of secrets! Like Fluttershy's secret fear of clowns. Or that time I caught Twilight sleep-trotting through town. Oh! And did you know that Octavia went on a date with Bulk Biceps? [chuckles] Talk about an odd couple. I heard that— Oh. All right. Point taken. But we're pals, right? Comrades. Amigos. Come on!
923000 [dreamy music]
9230db [deep gasp] big mac is going to propose to sugar belle?!? [echoing]
923000 [theme song]
923005 Of course Big Mac asked me to help with his proposal. I'm the most romantic dragon I know.
9230db [sighs] It really is a curse having infinite powers. Everypony is always asking you to move a couch or help with a proposal.
923005 Spill it! Every detail! Don't leave anything out!
9230db Ugh. Do we have to hear all the details? Is that like a "friend" thing?
923026 [sighs] Eeyup.
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923026 I don't talk much, so I want to show Sugar Belle how committed I am. First...
923000 [wood clattering]
923005 [gasps] You're making a picnic table that matches the shelf you made Sugar Belle for her shop when you had a crush on her, and you're setting up a romantic meal overlooking Sweet Apple Acres?
923026 Eeyup.
9230db Uh, how did you figure that out?
923005 If you were a hopeless romantic, you'd know that was the only logical choice.
923026 Then...
923005 You painted apples to leave around Ponyville with little riddles tied to the stem that will lead her up here to meet you?
923026 Eeyup.
9230db Seriously?!
923026 Now...
923005 Yuh—
9230db I know! You need a giant rhino named Dolores who can knit a romantic sweater for two!
923026 Uhhh... nope.
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923005 Come on. He needs food for the picnic. That was a gimme.
9230db I do not get this game.
923005 Okay. You finish your table, I'll pick up whatever you need to eat, and Discord will put all the apples in place.
9230db I will?
923026 Eeyup!
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923000 [poof!]
923000 [goat bleats]
923000 [chicken clucks]
9230db [reading] "From the Sugarcube Corner, look for your next clue. Red, delicious, sweet like you. Find it; you'll know what to do." [groans] He should stick to bucking apples.
923005 Sugar Belle's gonna love it!
923000 [thud]
923005 I'll get the food. How long will it take you to place all the apples?
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923005 Are you sure you put them in the right spots?
9230db Those terrible riddles on the apples were very clear on the location. I'm sure that they were placed properly.
923000 [beat]
9230db I-I-I think. Maybe. Does it matter?
923000 [beat]
9230db Oh, okay, fine! I'll double-check.
923000 [door opens]
923005 She didn't see the apple! What are we gonna do?
9230db Well, we could just give it to her.
923005 That's not romantic! She needs to discover it!
9230db Don't be such a drama dragon. I've precipitated liquid cocoa on Equestria and herded long-limbed Leporidae. I can certainly make a pony see an apple. [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923005 [sighs]
923000 [oven timer dings]
923005 Hey, Mrs Cake. I need to pick up a few things.
92302a Oh, I'm afraid you'll have to wait. I'm a bit busy at the moment. Oh. Is this sour cream or sweet cream?
923005 Oh, it's kind of important. Maybe I could take some of these off your hooves?
923000 [smack!]
92302a No! Those are for... something important, too!
923005 All of them? There's... one, two, three, four—
92302a Twenty-one! And yes, all of them!
923005 Who needs twenty-one desserts?
92302a I can't tell you! It's a secret! Come by later.
923005 Later won't work.
92302a Why not?
923005 I can't tell you. It's a secret.
92302a [muttering]
923005 [gags] Ugh! Did somepony else bake these?
92302a No. Why?
923005 No reason.
923000 [poof!]
923000 [pop]
9230db Shhh.
923000 [poof!]
92327f Thank you! These are perfect!
923000 [bits clinking]
923000 [poof!]
9230db You know, if she's too busy to read the horribly written clues, maybe you should just tell her. [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923000 [apple chittering]
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923000 [apples chittering]
9230db [gruffly] Listen up! Each of you has a job to do! Take a look at your stems!
923000 [apples chittering]
9230db Tell me about it. But regardless, go to your designated location, deliver your messages, and make me proud! Dismissed!
923000 [apples chittering]
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
9230db [sighs] I just have to say, Big Mac is really lucky to have me as a friend.
92302a Okay... One down, twenty to go. Then I can help you.
923005 Maybe I can help you. Delivering parchments is my thing. A little dragon breath and fwoosh! We deliver each scroll into each dessert. Then you can help me. Watch!
92302a [whimpers]
923005 [inhales, blows fire] Ta-da!
923000 [flames roaring]
923000 [ponies screaming]
923520 Hurry, there's no need to sneak!
923521 The next apple is at the boutique!
923000 [ponies screaming]
923000 [apples chittering]
923000 [doors open]
923000 [pop]
923000 [apple chittering]
923000 [pony yelps]
923000 [doors close]
923522 At Twilight's castle, take a right! The next apple sits in plain sight!
923000 [ponies screaming]
92302a What in the blazes is going on?!
923005 Discord.
923000 [poof!]
9230db [slurps] Oh! Are you finally finished? I've been done for a while.
923000 [ponies screaming]
923000 [splat]
9230db You know, thinking back, I probably could have been clearer which pony to deliver the messages to.
923005 You think?
923000 [apples chittering]
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
9230db I sent them back to Sweet Apple Acres. Apples are terrible at taking directions. Couldn't even manage to stay in one location. Now, bananas... [chuckles] ...are much better at listening.
92327f What's going on?
923005 Apples running everywhere, and she didn't see the poem to get to the hilltop?!
9230db Getting her to the hilltop is easy, and not seeing the poems is actually a blessing when you think about it. [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923000 [poof!]
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
92302a Why would you think sending flaming messages into my desserts would work?! You've ruined all of them!
923005 To be honest, I tasted some, and burning them might have been an improvement.
92302a What?! I never!
923026 Spike?
923005 Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what—
923000 [poof!]
923026 Sugar Belle!
92327f Big Mac?
923000 [poof!]
923026 Discord!
9230db Mrs Cake!
92302a What did I do?!
923000 [beat]
9230db Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
923005 I guess this can't get any worse.
9230db As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that.
923523 [screaming]
923009 It's comin'! Save yourselves!
923000 [booming]
923000 [birds chirping]
923524 sugar belle!!! sugar belle!!!
92300a We have a bit of a reputation for gettin' carried away.
923066 Especially when romance is involved. Heh.
923065 But that wasn't the case with this. We were just helping Sugar Belle with her plan.
92327f And the last one should just say "Eeyup!"
92302a [muttering] Three tablespoons... So, you're saying you want to put each one of those inside a dessert?
92327f Well, since Big Mac's plan to send me a Hearts and Hooves Day pie with a message inside didn't go so well, I thought it'd be fun to do it right.
923066 Awww! That's so romantic!
92327f He's a pony of few words. I love that about him. So, I thought I'd use as many words as possible to propose to him! All he has to say is—
92300a [imitates Big McIntosh] Eeyup! [giggles, normally] I can't wait for you to be a part of the family!
92327f You three played such a big part in Big Mac and I getting together. I'm glad you could help with this.
923065 [reading] "I-love-you-Big-Mac-would-you-like-to-spend-the-rest-of-our-lives-together-I-hope-you-say-eeyup!" And each word has to go into a dessert? That's... one, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Whoa!
92302a Twenty-one! I know!
92327f Actually, it's twenty-two. Mrs Cake was kind enough to help me bake all the apple-flavored treats I made to get Big Mac to visit me in my old shop. That one has the invitation for him to come here.
92302a Oh, it's... it's no bother! I do love a challenge! Did I add the sugar to this one or to that one?
923065 I think I've seen her add sugar to that bowl six times so far.
92327f Now you three go deliver that pie. I have to get some flowers to spruce the place up.
923000 [door opens]
92327f [gasps]
923000 [door closes]
92327f Uh-oh. Spike and Discord are outside. If they figure out what we're up to, they'll spill the beans! And I want this to be a surprise!
923000 [door opens]
923066 I don't think they suspect anything.
923065 Why would they suspect that we're holding an invitation pie and that Mrs Cake is baking a twenty-one-dessert proposal?
92300a I can't believe I'm gonna have a sister-in-law! [echoing]
923105 Shhhhhh!
923066 This is our shot to make up for all the trouble we caused when Big Mac first asked Sugar Belle out!
923065 We can't give away the surprise! You need to play it cool!
92300a Right, right. Uh, how's this?
923065 Better?
923066 Come on! Let's go find your brother!
923026 Screwdriver... Nope.
923000 [barn door opens]
92300a Big Mac! He ain't here. Let's go.
923065 Hold on... That looks just like the shelf Big Mac made for Sugar Belle. Weird.
923066 Maybe we should wait here for him. He's bound to show up soon.
92300a You know, When I'm lookin' for somethin', Granny says it's best to check the least likely place. Come on!
923026 Screwdriver!
923000 [door creaks]
923065 Big Mac!
923000 [loud thud]
923000 [crash!]
923000 [door closes]
923000 [raccoons snoring]
92300a Big Mac!
923000 [raccoons squeal]
923000 [door opens]
923066 Big Mac!
923000 [pony screams]
923000 [door closes]
923066 [groans]
923000 [door opens]
923000 [door closes]
923066 [sighs]
92300a How is Sugar Belle supposed to propose to Big Mac if we can't even find him?!
923065 Mrs Cake isn't finished yet. We still have time.
92300a You know, when I'm lookin' for somepony, Granny says it's best to just stay in one place. Let's head back to the farm and wait. Big Mac is sure to show up soon!
923000 [beat]
92300a Well, don't just stand there. Come on!
923000 [apples chittering]
923000 [poof!]
923525 Love is in the air! [chitters]
923026 Eeyup.
923000 [beat]
923026 Eeeeeeeeeyup.
923000 [squirrel chitters]
923009 [snoring]
923065 Granny!
923009 Aah! Who goes there?!
92300a Granny, have you seen Big Mac?
923009 Oh. Hey there, li'l dumplin'. I just had the most peculiar dream.
923065 That's nice, Granny, but we really need to find Big Mac, so—
923009 It was about Grand Pear. Only it wasn't. We were in outer space on some kinda mission to explore a strange new world.
923066 If we get stuck listening to Granny, we'll never find Big Mac.
923009 And Mudbriar was there, bein' as logical as ever, but his ears was all pointy-like. And then Discord showed up and... well, you know, he was pretty much the same.
92300a Once she gets goin', there's nothin' in Equestria that can stop her.
923000 [booming]
923065 You sure about that?
923000 [roaring]
923026 Spike?
923005 Aah! Uh, hey there, Big Mac. Heh. I bet you're wondering what—
923000 [poof!]
923026 Sugar Belle!
92327f Big Mac?
923000 [poof!]
923026 Discord!
9230db Mrs Cake!
92302a What did I do?!
923000 [beat]
9230db Nothing. I thought we were just saying each other's names.
923005 I guess this can't get any worse.
9230db As the Lord of Chaos, I'd advise against saying things like that.
923523 [screaming]
923009 It's comin'! Save yourselves!
923000 [booming]
923000 [birds chirping]
923524 sugar belle!!! sugar belle!!!
923026 Discord!
9230db Why does everypony immediately assume that this has something to do with me?
923524 i love you! you love me! our love will grow like an apple tree! So let me ask – will you marry me?
923000 [splat]
9230db Okay, but to be fair, the message did get to Sugar Belle.
9230db This whole story is being twisted to make it seem like it was all my fault. Which it wasn't!
92302a Wait. So you two were orchestrating a proposal? That's what I was doing!
9230db Who are you proposing to?
92300a Discord!
9230db Me?!
923524 i love you! i love you! i love you!
9230db [snaps]
923000 [poof!]
923000 [apples thudding]
923005 So the messages that were in the desserts...
92302a ...were Sugar Belle's proposal to Big Mac before Spike set them on fire!
9230db Oh, so I'm not the only one who messes things up, am I, Mr High-and-Mighty Dragon?
923005 Hey! Those desserts were ruined way before I ruined them!
92302a They were not! Well, I... may have mixed up a... a few ingredients. It was such a rush.
9230db You should both be very disappointed in yourselves.
923065 What about you and your apple monster?!
9230db Yes, but you all expect that of me.
92300a All we wanted to do was make up for messin' things up the last time. Sugar Belle, Big Mac, we're really—
923066 Where'd they go?
923000 [beat]
9230db Okay, this time, it really wasn't me!
92302a I shouldn't have taken all those desserts at once. It's just, how can you say no to such a sweet idea? Oh! Ha! "Sweet"! [laughs] I made a joke.
923005 In retrospect, dragon flame and baked goods aren't the best combo.
92300a We felt like it was all our fault.
923065 Except for the apple monster. That was Discord. And Mrs Cake messing up those recipes. And Spike burning the messed-up recipes. And—
923066 The point is we all felt bad for ruining Big Mac and Sugar Belle's proposals.
923009 It was all green, and then Grand Pear looked at me all dramatical and says, "Where nopony has gone before!" And whoosh! Away we flew!
92327f Today was... interesting.
923026 Eeyup.
92327f You okay?
923026 I... I'm sorry, Sugar Belle. I wanted everything to go right today. I wanted our love to be as perfect as my parents' was when they planted these two trees together. Instead, it turned into a mess. Just like when I asked you out. Just like Hearts and Hooves Day. No matter how hard I try, I always seem to mess up when it comes to you.
92327f I think you've got things backwards.
923026 What do you mean?
92327f From everything you told me about your parents, they had to deal with things a lot tougher than some burnt desserts and an apple monster.
923026 I.... guess that's true.
92327f This apple tree and pear tree are stronger together. They'll survive whatever comes because they don't have to do it alone. They belong together. Like your parents. And like us.
923026 Eeyup.
92327f Today was a disaster. But today was also the last day we're ever gonna have to do anything apart. From here on out, we'll be together. And we'll make sure everything always works out just right.
923026 Big McIntosh:
923026 Sugar Belle, will you—? Sorry.
92327f Sugar Belle:
92327f Big Mac, will you—? No, I'm sorry.
923026 On three?
92327f Sure. One...
923026 Two...
9233be Will you marry me? Eeyup! [kiss]
92327f We'll have to thank our friends for messing up so bad that they made it all work out perfectly.
923000 [apple chitters]
9230db Well, we've all made up, and we're here for a do-over. And this time, thanks to me, we've got it right. So, why don't you two... you know?
923005 Uh, I think they did okay without us.
92300a And that's how we were responsible for the perfect proposal! [laughs] Or, should I say, "pear-posal".
923066 If we hadn't messed up so bad...
923065 ...it wouldn't have worked out the way it did!
92302a It's just like baking. Sometimes, it's the mistakes that help you discover something truly special.
923005 And when all the planning and grand gestures go wrong, it reminds you the most romantic things are usually the simplest.
9230db Which is what I knew all along. You're welcome.
923000 [romantic music]
923010 It is my sincere pleasure to say, for my second Apple family wedding, that I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride!
92304d [cheering]
9230db That's your cue!
9230dd [singing] Happy marriage, happy Apples! Happy marriage...
923005 Discord!
9230db Oh, just let me have this one!
9230dd [singing] Happy marriage, happy Apples! Happy marriage, happy Apples!
923000 [credits]
92419c Hey there, my unicorn friend. Have you heard?
924526 About Princess Twilight Sparkle's coronation? Who hasn't? I'm on my way there now. So much baking to do and—
92419c No, no. [whispers] About the Earth ponies.
924526 I know their crops have been underperforming, but, uh...
92419c That's not it. They're hoarding the food for themselves! I heard the Mayor of Appleloosa say that if unicorns and Pegasi want to eat, they can use their own hooves to dig.
924526 How awful!
92419c We unicorns have to stick together, right? [sinister laughter]
924000 [transformation zap]
92426d Ah, Chrysalis. Another successful field trip, I presume?
92419c Spreading distrust among the unicorns and Earth ponies is almost too easy. We could take down Twilight and her friends a hundred times, but as long as they have the "love" of Equestria behind them, they'd crawl back to defeat us. Not anymore.
924485 No friendship, no magic! It's so obvious when you think about it. I did my part freaking out the Pegasi.
92426d And Grogar's long absence has given me time to prepare the next part of our plan. [blows]
924000 [grinding]
92426d Grogar's Bell. This artifact can steal any creature's magic. It holds that magic until it is released by this spell. Which means all the power inside is ours for the taking! [kissing]
924485 You're drooling on the Bell.
92419c Let's try the spell before Grogar gets back. I'm sick of waiting for that old goat's master plan.
92426d Take my hands.
924000 [beat]
92426d So we can all be part of the spell. Unless you'd prefer I take all the magic myself?
92419c Our pact stands. What we do, we do together. Once we defeat the protectors of Equestria, we can claim this land and rule our kingdoms alone once more.
924000 [magic humming]
924000 [reverberating gong]
924000 [magic humming]
9244d5 [laughing evilly]
924000 [theme song]
9244cf I have returned. Twilight Sparkle's coronation is today, and we are going to ruin it with this artifact. But to succeed, you must work together.
92419c Oh, way ahead of you, Grogar. [spits]
924000 [rumbling]
924000 [crash!]
924000 [magic zap]
9244cf The Bell! You had it all this time?! Why didn't you tell me?!
924485 We're villains. Duh.
924000 [magic zap]
924000 [reverberating gong]
924000 [magic humming]
9244cf [pained groaning]
924000 [thud]
92426d That was unexpected.
9240db [snapping fingers]
924485 Wait. Discord was Grogar? Like, the whole time? Should we follow him?
92419c Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.
924019 Doesn't she look so adorably regal up there?
92401a Our little Twilight, all grown up. Should we tell her that we've cleared out our royal suites so she and Spike can move in?
924019 Oh, maybe wait until after the coronation. Twilight doesn't need anything else to worry about today.
924005 So, you freakin' out yet?
924003 About what?
924005 Oh, I don't know. It's not every day the princesses that have ruled Equestria for hundreds of moons retire and pass all their responsibilities on to your and your friends.
924003 Oh, that. Actually, I'm feeling pretty good. We've all faced so much and come out okay. I know we're up to the challenge of keeping Equestria safe and happy. There's nothing we can't handle together. Which reminds me...
924005 Royal advisor? What's that?
924003 A new position I created for you. You've been at my side for every step of this journey. Knowing I had you to count on gave me the strength I needed to grow and succeed. I wouldn't be here without you.
924005 Thanks, Twilight. You know I'll always be your right-hoof dragon.
924003 I was hoping you'd say that. Because now that my crown's been fitted, we have some royal errands to run!
924000 [wind whistling]
92400d And you're sure this is where Pinkie told us to get the blackberries for her special coronation dessert?
92400e Maybe they keep their produce in the back?
924527 Nope. This is all we got. But I got a special on these taters.
92400d [gags]
92400e Um, no, thank you. We'll keep looking.
92400d [gags, coughs] Ooh! Twilight, darling! You're just in time. Only one more pre-coronation stop. We're picking up the final touch for your apres-hors d'oevres gown...
924003 Is that before or after the royal marshmallow-eating-contest gown?
92400d What?! I haven't made one of those! You must tell me when they add these sorts of things!
924003 [laughs] It's okay, Rarity. I was just joking.
924005 Joking? Day of her coronation? You've come a long way, Twilight.
924000 [door jiggling]
92400d Well, that's odd. They look open.
924000 [knock on door]
924098 What do you want?
92400d Oh. Well, this being a thread shop, I thought I might buy some?
924098 Put the bits in the mail slot.
924003 What was that about?
92400d You know designers. Don't like being interrupted when they're on a creative roll. With thread this exquisite, can you blame them?
92400c Weather for the coronation is sunny skies! It was weird, though. Not many Pegasi wanted to help me clear the clouds. They were kinda on edge.
924000 [door opens]
924000 [door closes]
924005 They're not the only ones.
92400d It's the first shift in royal power in over a millenium. Of course everypony is a little jumpy. Change does that.
92400e But I'm sure it's not because they're worried about you.
92400c How could they be? How many times have you saved their flanks by now?
924003 You're right. I'll just have to let everypony know that even with Celestia and Luna gone, we'll make sure things stay the same.
924008 Twilight! There you are! You mind tellin' your friend here that I don't need an official guard wherever I go? Especially if he ain't gonna help carry apples?
924003 I appreciate you taking such good care of my friends, but we're fine now.
924008 It was the strangest thing. He kept callin' me "Earth pony", like I didn't have a name. And watchin' me like he thought I'd steal the silver!
924000 [loud thud]
924007 Do not go in that kitchen!
92400c You look like you were in a sugar war.
924007 For some reason, the bakers are super grouchy with each other. That unicorn chef started throwing dessert at Mrs Cake! I tried to help, but I got caught in the crossfire! Tasty, tasty crossfire. [slurps]
924003 You sure this is just pre-coronation nerves?
9240db [groans] My aching metatarsals! You know, you forget how convenient snap-travel is.
924005 Wait. Did you just walk here on foot?
9240db Yes, actually. And I have a confession to make. You see, I might have made the teeeeeniest boo-boo. All very well-intentioned and noble on my part, of course, but—
924008 Get to the point, Discord.
9240db You remember that whole thing with King Sombra? That was slightly my fault. And by "slightly", I mean... I brought him back.
92400d You did?! But why?!
9240db Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Which is why I also brought back three other villains who are now on the loose and not really big fans of yours. So... my bad.
9244c7 [gasp]
92401a Let me get this straight. You wanted to boost Twilight's confidence, so you brought back Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Tirek to attack her?!
9240db Don't forget Sombra.
924019 And while you united these three villains, you pretended to be Grogar?!
92400e Discord, how could you do this to Twilight?! And us?!
9240db Look what a great job you did defeating Sombra. All the confidence you gained. Remember the cheering? The hoof-bumps?
924003 Except it was all a lie.
9240db A well-intentioned lie.
924008 For all the time you've spent with us, you really haven't picked up too much in the way of friendship lessons, huh?
924003 You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you? None of our successes were actually real.
9240db Of course they were! You just had an extremely good-looking safety net.
924005 And how was that supposed to help again?
9240db I intended to prepare Twilight for anything by orchestrating an epic attack at her coronation.
92400d You beastly beast! Don't you know how much this day means to Twilight?! And me?! I made her dress! Why wait until now for such a horrible plan?!
9240db You don't take a final exam on your first day of class. Just think – after defeating three baddies, Twilight would have to believe that she's the leader we all know she is!
924019 You have made a grave misjudgment, Discord. Do you have anything else you'd like to tell us?!
9240db Would you like the good news or the bad news?
92401a That wasn't the bad news?!
9240db All my chaos magic is... gone. Trapped in Grogar's Bell.
924005 [sighs] So what's the good news?
9240db Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy Glow now have all of the real Grogar's magic.
92400c in what world is that good news?!
9240db Compared to me losing my powers, anything else is good news!
924019 Twilight, Luna, we need to make a plan. Maybe it's not too late to stop this disaster from happening!
924003 I... I need some time to think first.
9240db Well, there isn't any time! Look what I overheard them saying! [snaps]
924000 [beat]
9240db Ugh! Just listen to my voice and use your imagination!
92419c [in Discord's voice] Let the fool go. Without magic, he's no threat. Besides, we have plans.
924485 [in Discord's voice] The "Lame Six" are so busy being perfect, they haven't even noticed what we've been up to. Have I mentioned how great revenge is?
92426d [in Discord's voice] I hope you got a name picked out for your future kingdom. Because it's time to destroy Equestria!
9244d5 [laughing evilly in Discord's voice]
9240db They're probably on their way to attack Canterlot right now!
924007 Then we'll stop 'em!
924003 How?! Stopping Sombra by himself was hard enough! And that was with lord-of-chaos training wheels!
924019 Twilight, it doesn't matter if Discord set up your successes or not. We believe in you and always have.
92401a Lean on your strengths to counter your weaknesses.
924003 My strengths? Right! Spike! Send a letter to Star Swirl! Tell him we need the Pillars to guard the border of Canterlot!
924003 [voiceover] If the villains are coming for a fight, we'll have one waiting for them! With Chrysalis on the loose, she'll go after Starlight! Warn Cadance and Shining Armor! They're our final line of defense if we fail!
924003 The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!
924485 We're not going anywhere until you two stop arguing! Chrysalis, say something nice about Tirek.
92419c [groans] He's... red.
924485 Tirek?
92426d She's... not as annoying as I expected.
924485 Good! Now we were talking about Grogar's Bell.
92419c We should take the magic inside it. You know how powerful Discord was. That much chaos magic in our veins...
92426d But taking it all would be madness! It's impossible for any other creature to control!
924485 I guess if you need a guinea pig to find out if anypony can use chaos magic, I'll volunteer.
924000 [magic zap]
924000 [reverberating gong]
924000 [magic humming]
924485 [bellowing evil laughter] Fools! Now I have more power than all of you! Kneel before my might!
924000 [magic zap]
924000 [rubber chickens squeak]
924000 [magic zaps]
924000 [pineapples snarling]
924485 Aah! Take it back! Take it back!
924000 [magic zap]
924000 [reverberating gong]
924000 [magic humming]
924485 [panting]
92426d Still think chaos magic is a good idea?
92419c Leave it in the Bell. We've got a kingdom to conquer.
924485 So, where should we strike first?
92419c [laughs] Everywhere.
924003 We've faced enemies of Equestria before. And we've always succeeded, no matter the odds. That wouldn't be possible without all of you.
9240db You're welcome!
924005 Dude, read the room.
924003 So I ask for your help again today in what is our biggest battle yet. All of Equestria is at stake, and I can't do this alone. But I'm not afraid. Because with friendship as our armor and teamwork as our power, nopony can ever bring us down!
924000 [doors open]
924485 Oh, come on!
924000 [thud]
924485 Where'd you get that? A daily affirmations calendar? Yeesh.
924003 Cozy Glow?! You're—!
924485 About to wipe the floor with you!
924000 [zap!]
924003 Aah! [groans]
924472 [gasp]
924485 Wow! It's true! Alicorns really do have more fun!
924000 [zap!]
92443c Spread out and stay ready, friends! Canterlot depends on us!
924000 [booming]
924000 [loud thud]
924000 [zap!]

924000 [magic humming]
924528 [groans]
92426d [smacks lips] Magic seasoned with age. Delicious.
9243fe No!
924000 [shatter!]
924000 [magic humming]
9243fe [groans]
92426d Oh, run along. The big stallions are playing.
9243fe [groans] Somnambula...! Warn... the princesses...!
924000 [loud thud]
924000 [magic humming]
92426d Ahhhh. The perfect dessert to a legendary meal.
92427c Stay with your buddy! No running! Just follow Counselor Trixie!
92419c Starlight, star bright. Where's the pony I want to fight?!
92427c I have to go. You got this?
924037 Nopony does a great and powerful escape like Trixie.
924000 [teleportation zap]
924000 [teleportation zap]
92419c Ah. Just the headmare I want to see.
92427c You didn't make an appointment! [yells]
924000 [teleportation zap]
924000 [teleportation zap]
924529 [groan]
924000 [wind howling]
92419c What is this place?
92427c Somewhere you can't hurt anypony!
92419c Wrong. I can hurt you!
924000 [multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
92419c Argh!
924000 [multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
92419c [growls] Stay still so I can blast you!
924000 [teleportation zap]
92427c Oh, yeah, real motivating!
924000 [zap!]
92427c Aah!
924000 [teleportation zap]
92419c [snarls]
924000 [zap!]
92419c Ugh! You'll pay for that!
92427c Put it on my tab!
924000 [teleportation zap]
924000 [zap!]
924000 [rumbling]
92419c No!
924000 [crash!]
924000 [teleportation zap]
924000 [boom!]
92427c Aah! Ugh! [groaning]
92419c Now I'll have all eternity to take my revenge on you!
924000 [zaps]
92452a [yelling]
924000 [zap!]
92452a [groaning]
924000 [splash]
924485 [laughing evilly]
924019 Stand down, Cozy Glow!
924485 Gee, I guess I could. But... I'm having too much fun!
924000 [zap!]
92452b Aah!
924000 [boom!]
924019 Ready, sister?
924003 Wait! What are you...?
924000 [zap!]
924000 [reverberating gong]
924000 [magic humming]
924268 [scream, pained groans]
924000 [thud]
924003 NO!
924485 That's the problem with you magic-types. You're so reliant on all your special power, you forget to use your brains!
924003 Keep telling yourself that! Now!
924000 [whoosh!]
924485 Whoaaaa!
924007 Surprise attack!
924000 [boom!]
924485 [coughs]
92400e Fly, my pretties!
924000 [geese squawking]
924485 Aah!
924005 [breathes fire]
924000 [boom!]
924000 [geese squawking]
924485 [grunts]
924005 [breathes fire]
924000 [geese squawking]
924485 Aah! Aah!
924000 [thud]
924000 [clatter]
924000 [boom!]
924000 [wind blowing]
924000 [thud]
924000 [magic hums]
92419c You think your pathetic shield can stop us? [laughs] The Pillars have been defeated. Your school is abandoned. Face it, Twilight. You've lost!
924003 You can attack us and we may fall. But Equestria will still stand, united in friendship. And we won't stop until we defeat you, no matter how many ponies you take down!
9244d5 [laugh]
92426d Didn't you all notice something was wrong in Equestria? We've been busy.
92419c A whisper here, a rumor there...
92426d Destroy some crops, cause some damage...
924485 Turn pony against pony...
92419c Until your whole kingdom is on edge, waiting for just one tiny thing to push them over the brink!
92426d There's no backup friends or rainbow magic to save you now!
924485 Golly, I think it's time for some redecorating!
924000 [magic humming]
924000 [explosion]
924000 [crumbling]
92419c You know what's stronger than friendship, Twilight? Fear!
924003 Aah!
924000 [shatter!]
92426d 'Cause when you have to protect yourself, you don't have time for anypony else.
924485 Too bad you never taught that in school.
924000 [magic humming]
924000 [crunch!]
924003 Huh?
92400d [groans]
924000 [zap!]
924000 [boom!]
924000 [rumbling]
92400d Go, Twilight! Get help!
924008 We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!
924003 No! I can't leave you here!
92400e It's our only chance!
92400c You'll come up with something to save the day!
924007 You always do!
924005 We believe in you!
9240db Fly, you foal!
924000 [crumbling]
924000 [teleportation zap]
924000 [To be continued...]
924000 [credits]
925000 [Previously on My Little Pony]
925005 It's not every day the princesses pass all their responsibilities on to you and your friends.
92501a You wanted to boost Twilight's confidence, so you brought back Chrysalis, Cozy Glow, and Tirek to attack her?!
925485 Discord was Grogar?
925003 You've been setting up challenges for us the whole time, haven't you?
9250db My bad.
925003 The ultimate battle for the fate of Equestria is coming!
925000 [explosion]
925008 We'll hold 'em 'til you get back!
9250db Fly, you foal!
925000 [teleportation zap]
925000 [theme song]
925485 And now for your complete destruction! Won't that be fun?
92519c Patience, Cozy. Destruction is so... permanent. We need to show the rest of Equestria that we've broken their heroes first. Besides, we should have fun with our guests.
92526d No! We should hunt down Twilight Sparkle. As long as she's out there, she's dangerous.
92519c Is that big, strong minotaur that scared of one little pony? Relax. It's not like her friends are going anywhere.
925000 [fizzle]
925000 [cage creaks]
92519c The fools brought the remains of my throne to Canterlot to protect themselves. Hah! Those shards block their magic. [to Cozy Glow] Careful. Too close and the shards cancel even our powers. But on this side of the cavern, we're the most powerful beings in Equestria, thanks to Grogar's Bell. Isn't that right, "Grogar"?
925000 [chains clanking]
92526d What are you doing?! You saw what happened when you tried to take Discord's chaos magic.
925485 Yeah, but there's Alicorn princess magic in there now, too! I could be so much more powerful if I just could have—
92519c What do you mean you could be?
925485 Um, hello? I'm the best one out of all of us! Nobody sees... [continues under]
92526d What are you talking about?!
92519c The best at what?!
92500e This is really bad.
925008 We gotta find Twilight. She's probably already figured out some way to defeat those monsters.
92500c Any idea how we get out of here to do that?
925000 [squish]
925005 Too sticky. There's no way anypony could get through this.
9250db I'm so sorry. It made so much sense in my head. Twilight defeats her worst enemies and is filled with confidence. I truly did have the best intentions. I swear I'll make it up to you.
92500c That's gonna need to be a pretty epic make-up.
92526d Stay away from the Bell, you pest!
925000 [zap!]
92526d None of us can use the Alicorns' magic until we figure out how to handle that fool's ridiculous chaos magic!
9250db I could always tell you how. It would give you power over all reality. But you'd have to ask nicely and spare my friends.
925005 No, Discord! This isn't the way to help!
925485 Discord, could you pweeeease—?
92519c Threats are more my speed. Speak!
92526d He's lying. He won't tell us.
9250db I certainly won't tell you after the way you lied to me last time we teamed up, you muscle-bound cretin.
92526d This "cretin" could destroy you before you blink, so choose your words carefully.
9250db You're right. "Cretin" is too polite. How about "pathetic centaur who uses magic to compensate for the fact that deep down he's afraid he'll never be enough to please dear old dad, King Vorak"?
925000 [zap!]
925000 [boing! boing! boing!]
925000 [crash!]
925485 [laughs] You missed!
92527c Did he, though?!
925000 [whirring]
925000 [shing!]
925000 [crash!]
92519c Get her!
925000 [multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
92527c [blows raspberry]
925000 [teleportation zap]
925008 Get Twilight!
92527c No way! She's always needed you guys!
925000 [whoosh!]
925000 [zap!]
92527c Ugh!
925019 Find Twilight! We may not have our magic, but we aren't completely helpless! We'll hold them off as long as we can!
92500c That... was a pretty epic make-up.
9250db Just save Equestria. And keep Fluttershy safe!
925000 [multiple magic/teleportation zaps]
925000 [crash!]
925509 Why are you out in the open?! Hide!
92500d Where is everypony?
925509 The unicorns have been gathering in Celestia's School of Magic ever since the attack. That's where I was headed when I saw you.
92500c What about the Earth ponies and Pegasi?
925509 It's everypony for themselves.
925008 That ain't right.
925509 Well, you can all stand out here and debate. I'm goin' where I'm safe.
925005 Chrysalis was telling the truth. They really have turned ponies against each other.
925008 Everypony's scared, that's all. We just need to get to Ponyville and find Twilight pronto. She'll know how to set things right.
925000 [ponies chattering]
925010 Please, stay calm! I know it seems bad, but there's no need to panic!
92552c Give us one good reason not to!
925000 [ponies yelling]
925010 [sighs] Because Ponyville's own heroes of Equestria are here to save us!
925008 Where'd all these ponies come from?
925009 Earth ponies been pourin' in lookin' for somewhere safe.
92552c We don't have unicorn magic to protect us or a city in the sky to hide in like those cowardly Pegasi!
92500c Cowardly?!
925000 [clouds rumbling]
92552c They're blocking Cloudsdale! Said they didn't want any "grounded" ponies up in their business!
92500c Listen up, buddy—!
92500e Don't! That's exactly what Chrysalis and the others want. More fighting. We know you're scared. We're here to help.
92552d You better fix this!
925000 [ponies yelling]
925008 Twilight's probably as worried as everypony else and tryin' to find somewhere safe. That's why I was sure she'd be waitin' for us in Ponyville. Where else could she be?
925005 [gasps] I know where Twilight is!
925000 [doors open]
925198 Oh, thank Celestia you're all alright. She's upstairs. It's... not good.
925000 [door opens]
925003 You're here?! I was so worried! Where are the princesses?
925007 They put up a crazy fight so we could escape and find you! Mission accomplished! Now let's save Equestria! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!
925003 They made a terrible mistake. You all did. From the second I got away, I've been searching every book, scroll, and spell for a way to rescue you and stop Chrysalis, Tirek, and Cozy, but I haven't found anything. I failed.
925005 You'll come up with something. We can't save Equestria without you.
925003 You all escaped without my help. You didn't need me then. So why would anypony need me now?
92500c We know things look bad, but we've been in tough spots before, and we always—
925003 Look around! Nothing we've ever done has mattered! Sombra? Returned and destroyed the Tree of Harmony! Chrysalis, Tirek, Cozy Glow? Returned and more powerful than ever! The School of Friendship? Shut down! Everypony in Equestria is so blinded by fear, they can't remember what friendship is! Nothing we do makes any difference!
925007 But we're still free and together.
92500c And it's not like things can get any worse.
925000 [windigos neighing]
925000 [wind howling]
925005 Haven't we learned never to say that by now?
925000 [windigos neighing]
92552e The windigos!
92552c [scoffs] That's just a Hearth's Warming Eve story.
92552e Creatures made of wind that spread cold and misery across the land to punish ponies?! Seems pretty real to me! Let the Pegasi deal with this! There's nothing we can do except hide!
925000 [ponies panicking]
92552f That's enchanted wind! We can't control it! And we can't rely on those snooty unicorns for any help! Build up the cloudbank! We'll try to block it!
925530 What about everypony down below?
92552f They're on their own. We all are.
925000 [windigos neighing]
925509 Fortify the shields around the School of Magic! We need to protect ourselves! It's all we can do.
925000 [ponies chattering]
92500c We have to do something!
925003 I've already done enough.
925008 You want the truth, Twilight? Bad things happen. No matter what you do, there's never gonna be a time when everything's perfect. But that don't mean you quit tryin'!
925003 What if I make things worse?! Ever since Celestia told me I was taking over, I've been gaining confidence. Then I find out it's all a lie. Equestria's been falling apart around us, and I didn't even notice! What kind of princess does that make me? I'm scared.
92500e I probably know more about being scared than anypony. But thanks to all of you, I've learned I'm always less scared when I'm with my friends.
92500c If we're facing impossible odds, we're facing them together!
92500d It's what we always do, darling.
925003 But we're on our own, and we have no idea what to do!
925007 That's true pretty much every time something terrible is about to happen.
925003 We don't have the Elements of Harmony anymore. How can you all be so calm about this?
925005 Because, even if you don't believe you can do this, we do. We believe in you. In us.
925008 The truth is, all our lives wouldn't be the same if we hadn't met. We're better off because of our friendship with you. So when you say you haven't made a difference, that's just not true. You've made a big difference to us.
925003 Thank you. Sometimes even the Princess of Friendship needs a reminder that there's more to the Magic of Friendship than rainbow lasers.
925005 Although that part is pretty cool.
925003 We still need a plan.
925000 [door opens]
925198 That sounds like the pony I used to foal-sit for. Count us in.
925003 No. You need to stay here and protect Flurry Heart. If we don't... If things don't work out, she's Equestria's last hope. Okay. Three of our worst villains have taken over, powered up by ancient magic. Everypony in Equestria is so scared and divided that the windigos are circling. And it's up to us to fix it all.
925007 What are we gonna do, Twilight?!
925003 The same thing we do every time, Pinkie. Try to save the world!
92526d Every prisoner is safely in their cells. Now we can hunt down the rest of the— Windigos?
925485 I'm not hunting anypony d-d-d-down in this weather! Can't we magically get rid of them and w-w-w-warm things up?
92519c I don't think we should. This could work out quite well for me.
92526d You mean us.
92519c The harsh weather is the final blow to break the ponies' spirits. Once Equestria is a frozen wasteland, we'll use our magic to destroy those windy beasts. Ponies will be so grateful, they'll do whatever I want!
92526d The windigos are ancient magic. It would be unwise to leave them unchecked. Best we deal with them now.
92519c [snarls]
925485 We probably should deal with Twilight and her friends before anything else.
92526d I thought it was too cold for you to hunt anypony down.
925485 We don't need to. They're right there!
925005 You think they know we're here?
925000 [magic whooshing]
925008 I'd say they have an idea.
925003 That bell has Discord, Celestia, and Luna's magic inside. If they use it against us—
92500e Discord's magic is so chaotic, he's the only one who can use it.
92519c You just can't accept that you were beaten before you even realized there was a fight, can you?
925003 You can't beat us if we never give up! As long as I have my friends by my side, I'll put my faith in friendship—
925485 Ugh, can we get on with this please?
925000 [zap!]
925000 [boom!]
925000 [teleportation zap]
925003 We need to get that bell and get Discord and the princesses their magic back. Rainbow Dash, Pinkie, you're with me.
92500c Sweet! I'll grab that bell in ten second—!
925003 No. We're the distraction. They're gonna get the bell.

925007 Close, but no cherrychimichanga!
925000 [zap!]
925007 [laughs] Thanks for playing!
925000 [zap!]
925485 Do they have to be so annoying?!
925000 [zap!]
92519c Not annoying! Distracting!

925000 [zap!]
92519c Enough! Or the dragon's wings get plucked!
925005 [groans]
925003 Please! Don't hurt him!
925005 Don't worry about me! Just save—! [groans]
92526d Turns out that the Magic of Friendship is your biggest weakness. A fitting end to your pathetic story.
925000 [magic whirring]
92500c No matter what, we face it together!
925000 [windigos howl]
925000 [zap!]
925000 [boom!]
925000 [magic humming]
925005 What happened? Can I open my eyes?
925008 Ya sure can! Way to go, Twilight!
925003 It's not me!
925000 [marching sounds]
925000 [whooshing]
925000 [transformation zaps]
92526d Don't let them escape!
925485 Which ones?!

925000 [stomps]
925000 [whooshing]
925485 Whoa!
925000 [magic zaps]
925361 The changelings won't fool them forever. And I don't know how long the unicorns' shield will hold.
925003 I don't understand. How are you all here?
925184 That's kinda our fault.
925186 You know those long lectures about friendship you gave at school?
925000 [windigos howling]
925000 [ponies panicking]
925188 We all know the story of Hearth's Warming Eve! We can defeat the windigos together!
925064 You really think if we all sing a couple songs, everything will be fine?
925188 It's not just singing that saved the founders of Equestria! It's what it represented!
925531 Earth ponies, unicorns, and Pegasi becoming friends! We learned at Twilight's school that friendship is the most powerful magic there is!
925530 Focusing on our differences keeps us divided! Villains and creatures like the windigos use that division against us!
925187 Yaks strong. Ponies strong. But yaks and ponies stronger together! Yaks must be loyal to pony friends!
925186 I know helping other creatures by being kind and generous sounds lame. But I've seen how powerful it can be!
925184 Playing together! Singing together! Even laughing together! That's what real heroes look like!
925185 Were we really happy by ourselves at the bottom of the ocean? Be honest! It's the ponies that showed us a better way!
925189 They've taught us how powerful love and the Magic of Friendship truly is! We can't let them stand alone! We're their friends! They need us!
925008 How 'bout that? It's just like you said the day we opened that school.
925005 The more creatures who know about friendship, the safer we'll be.
925007 We told you you had it all figured out!
925000 [thud!]
925000 [thud!]
925000 [cracking]
925000 [magic zaps]
925000 [zap!]
925003 ENOUGH! Because of you, I almost lost my way! But everycreature here has reminded me of the true power of friendship! There will always be darkness in the world, but there will also always be those who find the light! The Pillars knew this! That's why they created the Elements of Harmony! The Elements showed me and my friends how strong our friendship could be! Together we worked to bring harmony to Equestria! But there will always be more to do! Which is why we teach others about the Magic of Friendship! Others who will continue our mission after we are gone! Now I truly understand! The Elements were just symbols! The real magic has always been right here! And the more who understand how powerful friendship is, the stronger we will all be! Together!
925000 [magic surging]
925000 [boom!]
925485 This is bad, isn't it?
925000 [BOOM!]
925000 [magic humming]
925000 [clang!]
925485 [groans]
92519c You think friendship will save you?! We will always return! Nothing will ever stop—!

925007 Hmmm... Tingly. Itchy. Also like...
925000 [slam!]
925007 i could transform the cosmos so everything is made of icing!
9250db Perhaps maybe I should...
925000 [reverberating gong]

9250db [whispering] You know what I would do if I were... [indistinct]
92501a Oh. That does seem fitting.
9250db May I help? Please?
925000 [zap!]
925000 [boom!]
925000 [cracking]
92519c [snarls]
925000 [thud!]
9250db Together forever. I can't think of anything that they would want less!
925000 [ponies cheering]
925019 When I sent you to Ponyville, I had high hopes. When you became Princess of Friendship, I knew I made the right choice. But nothing could prepare me for how proud I am right now. Equestria is definitely in the right hooves. You are ready.
925003 You know what? I think I am.
925008 Thank goodness. First question, your Highness. What do we do with all these creatures?
925007 We're gonna need a lot more chairs for the coronation!
925003 Actually, as ruler of Equestria, I'd like to postpone the coronation for a while. At least until the castle's rebuilt. Besides, there's something we need to do first.
92500d Post-apocalyptic donuts. Interesting choice.
925003 I know. But there's gonna be plenty of time for all the challenges and struggles and adventures to come. For now, I just want to spend a quiet moment with the six best friends I've ever had.
925008 Well, mostly quiet.
925007 [eating noisily] Mmmm!
92500e It's like the end of an era.
92500c Or the beginning of an even more awesome era!
925003 All I know is whatever comes next is going to be perfect.
925005 How do you know that?
925003 With you guys by my side, how could it not?
9254c7 [laugh]

926000 [ponies and creatures chattering]
926000 [camera clicks]
926000 [door opens]
926532 I got here as soon as I could, but friendship ambassador is a full time job these days. Making peace between Abyssinians and the Diamond Dogs has not been easy.
926169 That's why I picked you for the job. But I'm glad you could come.
926532 So what's the emergency?
926169 Ever since I took over Celestia's School, my focus has been on teaching magic. But now it seems my top student has missed the most important lesson of all.
926532 What do you mean?
926169 Let's just say it'll be good to have my royal advisor and friendship ambassador by my side.
926533 Your Majesty, she's here.
926169 Send her in, Gallus.
926000 [door opens]
926534 Your Majesty.
926169 Luster, I may be ruler of Equestria, but I'm still just your teacher.
926534 And you've been wonderful. I've enjoyed every moment at the School of Magic. But I'm just not sure it's the right place for me.
926169 I see.
926534 And it's not the work. I could spend weeks in the library doing research. It's just that there's a lot of focus on making friends.
926532 If that's your problem, you've come to the right place.
926534 But that's just it. I don't want to make friends.
926532 What?! [clears throat]
926169 So you'd rather leave the School of Magic than make friends?
926534 I was hoping to set up an independent course of study. I want to accomplish as much as you have someday.
926532 It'll be hard to do that without friends.
926534 I'm not so sure. Friendship looks like more of a distraction than anything else and ultimately a waste of time.
926532 What?!
926534 I know you and your friends accomplished a lot together, but that was so long ago, and as far as I can see, you rule by yourself now.
926532 Uh, hello? Royal advisor right here.
926534 And I don't think there's anything wrong with that. In fact, I think it's better. Plus, if friendships ultimately fade, why even make them in the first place?
926169 You know what, Luster Dawn? You're right.
926532 WHAT?!
926000 [theme song]
926532 Friendship is more trouble than it's worth?! [to Twilight] This is your top student?
926169 Friendships take work, and there's no guarantee they'll last. They can be complicated. They can be messy. And they never go the way you plan. Friendship is a hard thing to navigate. I remember the first time I realized it might not last forever.
926003 [panting, yelping]
926005 Twilight? Uh, I'm pretty sure that's everything.
926003 I'm just doing a final check, Spike.
926005 But we did a final check. Of every room. Twice.
926003 Ah-ha! See? An issue of Power Ponies. Now, aren't you glad we triple-checked?
926005 Thanks, but I already read this one. I don't need to take it to Canterlot.
926003 No-no-no! You love Power Ponies. We're taking it.
926005 Really, Twilight, we don't have to bring the comic. I'm not even sure how much longer I'll collect them. A lot is changing, and I am getting older.
926003 Just because things change doesn't mean you leave everything you love behind! [sighs]
926005 You're not still worried about ruling Equestria, are you?
926003 No. I know it took some time, but I've never been more ready for anything in my life. Just because I'm ready to sit on the throne in Canterlot, doesn't mean I'm ready to leave Ponyville. When we were all fighting to save Equestria from Tirek, Chrysalis, and Cozy Glow, I was too busy to think about it. But now it's all happening at once.
926005 What is?
926003 The coronation. Moving. Leaving our friends.
926005 I thought we'd all be ruling Equestria together.
926003 Of course we will, but it won't be the same. They all have lives here. We're moving away and they're not, and I can't help but feel like we're leaving them behind. What if we all just drift apart?
926005 I guess I hadn't thought about it like that. Maybe you should talk to them. I bet they're feeling the same way.
926003 You're right, Spike. Thanks. Sometimes talking to a good friend is all it takes.
926000 [crates closing]
926000 [stamping]
926003 So, you're not worried about how things might change with me living in Canterlot?
926008 Of course not. Change is natural, like the seasons. That's just life on the farm.
926003 I guess so.
926008 Anyhoo, I really need to get all these boxes packed and sorted. There's a lot more work now that the folks beyond Equestria are comin' to the coronation, too.
926007 Worried? Pfft! No way! Unless you're talking about the coronation, because then yes. Obviously the cakes are handled, but there's the whole rest of the party to stay on top of. [whispering] And honestly, I'm not convinced Gummy really took care of the fireworks.
926000 [sparkler sizzling]
926003 But what about after the coronation? Don't you think things are gonna be different?
926007 Well, since I'll be in charge of all the Canterlot galas from now on, I'll have to go there a lot more. So I guess that's different, but I don't think I mind.
926003 No. Of course not.
926000 [birds chirping]
926000 [doves cooing]
92600e Wonderful work, everyone! We couldn't be more ready. Josephine, if you and the rest of the doves leave now, we should all arrive in Canterlot at the same time.
926000 [doves cooing]
92600e Eloise and Hubert, you should go, too. I know it's a long way, but don't worry. I'll bring plenty of snacks to restore your energy before we perform.
926000 [swans honking]
92600e Everyone else gets to ride since the trip's too much for your little wings. We need everyone in tip-top shape for the coronation. I'm glad we got the chance for one last rehearsal. Everyone's so excited. But I can't imagine anypony's more excited than you. Moving to Canterlot. Being crowned. I can't think of a single bad thing about any of it!
926003 [nervous laugh] Yeah. Me, neither.
92600c In three, two, one, and...
926000 [whooshing]
926000 [smack!]
926000 [zoom!]
926000 [soft thud]
92607c Look, Rainbow Dash. I know this is important to you, and we all want the routine to be special, but are you sure it needs to be this complicated?
92600c Of course! And I know we can pull it off! Sorry, Twilight. I don't have time to talk. We've got a lot more work to do before the coronation.
926003 [sighs]
92600d Darling, change is an integral part of fashion. I myself am considering opening boutiques for non-ponies. Things must evolve, or they become stale. For example... I was just struck with a sudden inspiration to change my design for your gown by including the webs of these star spiders. They glow for a short while after they're spun. They won't have much time to weave the sash, but the effect will be dazzling. You see, darling? Change can be fabulous if you embrace it!
926000 [doors open]
926005 Starlight is supposed to come over soon. There's a little something we wanted to give you before we leave. You know what? I think you're right, Twilight. I should take my comics to Canterlot. We can't leave the Power Ponies behind.
926003 I don't think the Power Ponies care, Spike. Just like all of our friends.
926008 All right, Twilight. Are you ready? We all wanted to see you off, but there's still a lot to do.
926005 Aren't you coming on the train?
926008 I gotta go with Big Mac so we can go over our packin' list or we won't know who gets what deliveries.
92600c And I'm gonna meet the Wonderbolts so we can go over the routine one last time.
926007 I'm going with Gummy. He said he knows when the fireworks display should start, but does anypony really believe that?!
92600e And I still need to pick up food for the swans and doves who flew ahead to Canterlot. If I don't get them fed, they'll be too pooped to perform.
926003 Well, I'll be living in Canterlot alone. Might as well take the train alone, too. Bye, I guess.
92600d Oh, you won't be traveling alone, darling. I'll have just enough time on the train to weave the star spider sash for your gown. But we should leave now. There's no time to dawdle if you want the coronation to be perfect.
926003 That's the problem! You're all so worried about making my coronation perfect, but I'm leaving Ponyville and none of you even care!
926025 [gasp]
926534 Exactly. You moved away, your friends didn't care, and that was that.
926169 Actually, not exactly.
926008 Of course we care that you're movin', Twilight.
92600e I can't believe you'd think we don't.
926007 What could possibly make you think that?
926003 I tried to talk to you all about how I was feeling, but you seemed more worried about what you had to do for the coronation.
926005 It's true. I was there.
92600d I suppose it gave us something else to focus on.
926008 I knew you were worried about everything changin'. I guess I thought if I made it seem like everything was okay, it would be.
92600e I was just trying to make you feel better. That way I wouldn't feel so terrible.
926003 Before I moved to Ponyville, I didn't really know what friendship was. You've all taught me so much. I can't believe it all might be ending. But when I imagine the future, all I can think about is that we won't be together! I'm literally moving away from you, and it's terrifying!
92600e I'm scared, too.
926007 Me, too.
92600d Rattled to the core.
926008 Eeyup.
92600c I wouldn't say scared.
926000 [beat]
92600c Buuuut just because I won't say it doesn't mean I don't feel it.
926007 I'm going to miss you so much!
92600d I just can't stop thinking about how much things are going to change!
92600c W... What if we don't see each other?
92600e What if we don't talk as much?
926008 What if we don't stay friends?!
926024 [crying]
926003 I know it's weird, but knowing you're all are as upset as I am actually makes me less worried.
926005 That's nice, but you should be more worried about missing the train to Canterlot!
926000 [doors open]
92627c Sorry, I'm so late. I actually thought I'd missed you—
926005 There's no time!
926000 [smack!]
926000 [thud]
926000 [train whistle blows]
926003 Oh, no! We missed it! But maybe...
926000 [teleportation zap]
926003 Okay. We're on the train. Everything should be fine, right?
926000 [beat]
92600d I'd worked out exactly how much time I needed to weave my star spider sash, and now I'm behind!
926008 I hope Big Mac can figure out who gets what deliveries on his own.
926020 I assume these contain the finest sparkling apple juice?
926026 Eeyup!
926535 Ah, the Sweet Apple Acres applesauce for my coronation parfait! This is, uh, the applesauce?
926026 Uhhh... eeyup?
92600e [sighs] I don't have the snacks the doves and swans will need to perform after their long flight. I'd better find the food car.
926000 [star spiders screech]
926000 [hummingbirds tweet]
92600c And I need to meet the Wonderbolts!
926000 [zoom!]
92600c Where's the coronation team?
926436 Well, they waited, but when you didn't show, they thought you must've meant to meet outside of Canterlot.
92600c [growls]
926007 The only thing I'm worried about is Gummy handling the fireworks display. But I'm sure it's fine. [nervous laugh]
926003 Well, it could always be worse.
926000 [brakes screech]
926000 [sheep baaing]
926000 [doors open]
926003 [panting]
92601a Goodness, Twilight. Are you all right?
926003 My friends and I had a few hiccups on the way. But everything's fine now.
926000 [sheep baaing]
926019 We really are both just so proud of you. If you need a moment, that's all right. It is your coronation.
926000 [trumpet fanfare]
92601a Although it would be nice to get started. Are you ready?
92600d NO! She can't possibly be crowned without wearing her coronation gown!
926019 Very well. [to audience] Citizens of Equestria and beyond!
926000 [crowd cheering]
926000 [yaks stomping]
926000 [dragons breathing fire]
926019 My sister and I have ruled this land for quite some time, but even we know that change eventually comes to us all. And though we know it can be unsettling, it's as natural as the rising and setting of the sun and the moon. Both of which my sister and I feel confident leaving in the hooves of the pony who will come after us.
926003 [whimpering]
92600d You look amazing. Ooh! I almost forgot!
926019 And so without further ado, I give you the new ruler of Equestria - Princess Twilight Sparkle!
926003 [yelps]
926000 [thud]
926019 [gasps]
926000 [crowd gasps]
926003 Sorry.
926000 [magic surges]
926000 [crowd ooh's]
92601a Um, Twilight?
926000 [birds chirp]
926000 [star spiders screech]
92600e Oh, dear. I know these aren't the snacks I promised, but it's all I could find.
926000 [swans honk]
92607c Well, Dash or no Dash, Twilight's about to get that crown. Wonderbolts, roll out!
926000 [zoom!]
92600c No! Wait!
926000 [zoom!]
926000 [fireworks explode]
926000 [swans honk]
926003 Aah!
926000 [crowd gasps]
926008 To Twilight!
926000 [splat]
926000 [crowd murmuring]
92601a Hmm. Close enough.
926003 [whimpers]
926534 Okay, I get it now. Your coronation was such a disaster that you and your friends never really recovered, and that's why you all drifted apart.
926532 Well, you're half right.
926534 So the coronation wasn't a disaster and your friendships just faded away over time?
926169 Not exactly.
926000 [door opens]
926536 [sighs] Sorry I'm late. But it is so hard to find a sitter with a sense of humor for Li'l Cheese.
926000 [Boneless 6 squeaking]
926537 Honestly, I would have been here sooner, but you would not believe how busy Yakyakistan is these days.
926538 Maybe we could get to places on time if you let me do some of the chores instead of always doing everything yourself.
926539 Maybe I would if you did them the right way. Oh. Sorry. We're not the last ones, are we?
92653a Discord's headed to an O&O convention or he'd be joining us.
926534 I just assumed that since you all aren't together all the time now—
926169 That we aren't friends?
92653b [laugh]
926169 That is not the point of my story. It's true my coronation was a disaster.
926007 [gulps] Well, at least the coronation is over.
926003 [groans]
926007 [snickers]
926012 [laugh]
926003 That was something.
92627c I was just about to say the same thing. I know maybe it wasn't the coronation you planned, but it's good to see all of you laughing.
926005 We wanted to give this to you before you left Ponyville, but things got a little hectic.
92627c Since you're moving away, we thought if you missed any of us or Ponyville, this might help.
926003 Awww.
926007 It's a book of memories.
926008 And we all chipped in some.
92600e No matter how much things change, you'll always have this to look back on.
926003 I love it. Thank you so much. But I don't want to only look back. Obviously the coronation wasn't perfect, but that doesn't matter. It's our relationships that really count, and we have to maintain them.
92600d But now that we'll be living in different places, I'm not exactly sure how.
926003 I am. I suggest we meet once a moon. In fact, my first royal decree as ruler of Equestria is to establish this Council of Friendship!
92653d [cheer]
926019 And what a wonderful decree it is!
92601a We always knew that whatever adversity you faced, you and your friends would find your way through it together.
926019 We know Equestria is in the perfect hooves with you and your friends looking out for it. And while we'll always be here if you need us, it's time for us to be on our way.
926003 You're leaving?
92601a We hope you'll come and visit us in Silver Shoals.
926019 But now it's time for you to rule on your own. You're all more than capable.
926003 Thank you. For everything. Mmmm! [chuckling]
92604d [laughing]
926534 So, even though everything changed and you moved away from your friends, you didn't grow apart? And this is the Council of Friendship? That's what you're all doing here?
926538 Duh! This time every moon.
926539 [chuckles] What she means is this is how we've been rulin' together.
926537 And how we've continued to face every problem and threat to Equestria over the years.
926536 But mostly, it's how we keep in touch. No matter how busy life gets.
926169 Sometimes friendships can be hard, and it takes work to maintain them. But without friends, things can be a lot harder.
926534 I never thought about friendship being something to work at, and I don't mind work. I guess if they don't have to fade away, maybe making friends isn't the waste of time I thought. But I've been so focused on my studies, I wouldn't know where to start.
926169 That's all right, because I know exactly where to send you.
926169 [Future Twilight Sparkle]
926169 When I started out, I was unsure
926169 I thought I knew all that I needed, didn't know what to expect
926169 But when my walls came down, I saw the truth
926169 All along something was missing
926169 And I think you'll see it, too
926169 This is where the magic happens
926169 This is where the magic lives
926169 Our friendships weave together stronger
926169 The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer
926169 And the greatest spell you'll know
926169 Is how the Magic of Friendship grows
926536 [Future Pinkie Pie]
926536 And no matter how much time goes by
926536 The party will still be here with some fun new games to try
926538 [Future Rainbow Dash]
926538 Big adventure's waiting obviously
926538 Long as we're still here together
926538 We'll be flying happily
926000 [Twilight, Pinkie Pie, and Rainbow Dash]
926000 This is where the magic happens (where the magic happens)
926000 This is where the magic lives (where the magic lives)
926000 Our friendships weave together stronger
926000 The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer
926000 And the greatest spell there is
926000 What the Magic of Friendship gives
926539 [Future Applejack]
926539 And it's somethin' true to pass on down
926539 To generations yet to come
926537 [Future Rarity]
926537 And we'll never stop believing in
926537 The generosity of the friendships we've won
92653a [Future Fluttershy]
92653a And because the love that I feel
92653a For every single living creature is something that is real
92653a Friendship happens so naturally
926169 [Future Twilight Sparkle]
926169 Oh, and how I used to wonder
926000 [Choir]
926000 (Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh...)
926169 [Future Twilight Sparkle]
926169 What friendship could be!
92604d [All]
92604d This is where the magic happens (where the magic happens)
92604d This is where the magic lives (where the magic lives)
92604d Our friendships weave together stronger
92604d The bonds grow deeper, lasting longer
92604d And the greatest spell you'll know (you'll know)
92604d Is how the Magic of Friendship grows
926169 [Future Twilight Sparkle]
926169 How the Magic of Friendship grows
926000 ["My Little Pony" theme melody]
926000 THE END
